1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,360
Come that sweet, sweet sugary baby, Griffin McElroy. So stoked to be back in the McElroy

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Studios here after our trip to Boston, which was just a delight. You left an egg sandwich.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,080
You left two egg sandwiches just sitting here on this on the audio switchboard, Justin,

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,320
and they've created a powerful stink in the hot summer sun. Now, to be fair, actually,

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,200
it's melted into the soundboard and created its own little like biosphere kind of thing. It's

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
really weird and gross. Now that was OK, that there was reasoning behind that. I did have a

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,160
reason for that. I was worried that we would all be killed in Boston, perhaps, you know,

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,200
purge 24-7. So that's why I put the sandwiches under glass. And if you look closely, you can

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,920
see the little nameplate that says, as eaten by beloved my bim bam host, Justin McElroy,

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
1980 to 2016. Yeah. Always rolling. You ate that sandwich for 36 years?

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,080
Always riding. No, that's my life. He's really been savoring this bad boy.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,560
Yeah, it's like it's like, you know, how they turned Dolly Parton's childhood home

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,480
into a Dollywood exhibit. And they just left all the old, old ass egg sandwiches that she'd

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,200
taken single bites out of and then just let the hot, stinky summer sun just do they thing on

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,640
these egg sandwiches. The best thing about-

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, they wanted to really give you what it was like to grow up in Dolly Parton's

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,320
egg sandwich filled home. How sweet would it be if everything was exactly like it was like,

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,280
this is how we grew up, y'all. It was just like this. And there was just like one giant stack of

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,640
empty folded down Mountain Dew cartons. It was like, listen, we pounded the stuff. We're crazy

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,800
for it. That was my childhood. Now, I hope nobody thinks I make a funny Dolly Parton. I fucking

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
love Dolly Parton. Well, the voice was pretty insulting.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,920
It was insulting. Hey guys, it's me, Dolly Parton. I'm an idiot. That's basically what you were

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
doing. I wrote Jolene. I'm a big, stupid idiot. Listen to my damn voice.

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,800
I wasn't trying to- That sound was me farting. I'm Dolly Parton.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Dolly Parton's more like it. Okay. Well, I'm not sure about any of that.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,600
I just want, I don't own that. I love Dolly Parton. That was Justin.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,840
That's how I sounded. The one, I've been working my voices lately.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah. Because I'm reading a lot of children's

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,440
books and that really gives you a lot of chance to play and explore the space.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Hell yeah. I've been reading this Mary Poppins book.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
That's about the one scene where they go to visit Uncle Albert, the guy who laughs and floats.

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:32,960
You remember? So I am on one page floating between peak Mary Poppins, peak Julie Andrews,

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
flowing- Can you give me a little bit of that sweet nectar?

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Hers is like, spit spot children, come along. That's actually really good.

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,840
That's going to get some ASMR to people.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,920
And then I'm going to, and then I like effortlessly flow into bad cockney Dick Van Dyke.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,520
So he's like, you know, I had a story about my uncle. He's got this-

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
That's actually too good, Justin. I'm sorry.

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
He works at a pork factory and he spends all day making feces.

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,200
There it is.

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
Like flip, like a ninja over a back table, right into Edwin.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
It's like, I'm sorry, children. I just can't stop from laughing.

49
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Oh God, see that's my ass.

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
What's the chuckles get to me? I start flying.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
That's my ASMR right there. The one that just kind of conflicts with like what my brain wants and need.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,840
It's kind of like a, kind of like a BDSMR.

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,280
Or it's just like, you treat my ears so bad, so bad.

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,000
So you didn't like, I thought it was like the first time-

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
You never know how these voices are going to come out of you.

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Like, if you read any stories about- You guys will eventually read some books about-

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,160
You guys will eventually read some books about Mickey Mouse.

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,000
And you're going to find that you are doing a passable Minnie Mouse or Mickey Mouse.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
And then either Donald or Goofy will come on the scene.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
And it's just like, I don't- Here comes this.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
Can you give me a Donald?

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
Yeah, I'll give you a Donald.

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
My Donald is like this.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I forgot to turn the lights off, Mickey. Sorry about that.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
I was going to say, my Donald is just going to be a terrible Gilbert Gottfried.

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
And that's basically what you did as well.

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
Does Charlie look at you when you do that, like you've disappointed her?

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
Like, that's not Donald.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,480
Does she look on in fear?

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,120
Because it sounds like that impression is being wrung out of you by a large man.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
Like Brock Lesnar is like kicked in the door to the nursery

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,920
and just grabbed you by the ankle and neck

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,960
and just wrung you until a Donald impression came out.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Well, let me hit you with this.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm sorry, children.

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
I just start laughing and I float up to the ceiling.

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
Is that Goofy or Ed Wynn?

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
That's Ed Wynn. He's back.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,520
It does sound a lot better now compared to your Donald.

80
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Yeah, it makes it better by comparison.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,080
But yeah, I have no Donald. I have no Goofy.

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
And does Charlie understand?

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm sorry, my child.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,280
I have no Donald or Goofy for you today.

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
I have no Donald today.

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
I have no Donald or Goofy today.

87
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,040
We could wait until like a two or three in the afternoon

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,600
when perhaps my instrument is more warmed up.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
I might be able to deliver you a passable Goofy.

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,040
I've got to juice my diaphragm.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,680
It would be me sitting alone in a room,

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
like talking to myself, like...

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
See, that sounds good.

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
The death rattle of Donald the Duck.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,800
That's Donald Duck choking on a Werther's original.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
It's very specific, but I think you all agree that I'm right.

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
That's probably what it would sound like.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,880
Is this dad-ass humor going to be the only shit now?

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,360
Do you think?

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm not knocking.

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm just saying, I think we're about to enter a new phase of just dad-ass.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
Do we have to start calling the show My Daddy, My Daddy, and Me?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
Three Daddies.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Daddy alert.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
My Three Dads.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,520
There's a name for a podcast.

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
Too Many Dads.

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
Daddy Town.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Here it is.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Three Many Dads.

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
We're a trio of smaller than average dads.

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
Three Many Daddies.

114
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,040
No, Many, M-A-N-Y.

115
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
Many.

116
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Many.

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
I actually like Justin's better.

118
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
I would like us to be just smaller versions of ourselves,

119
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
like a Travis at like a tenth of the scale,

120
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
but I still have to deal with full-grown problems.

121
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh, sure.

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Yeah.

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Navigating the world.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah.

125
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
We were going to talk about something else,

126
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,760
but then we kind of went down another vein and I'm fine with it.

127
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,120
Save the other intro for later.

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
I gotta be honest, guys.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
When I saw Uncle Albert was in this book,

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,920
I just had to open my mouth and just like fling my arms wide

131
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480
and just let myself fall like the guy

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,720
from that Collective Soul video off the building,

133
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,320
just hoping Edwin would catch me and shepherd me away.

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
He's the Edwin beneath your wings.

135
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,880
There it is.

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
There it is.

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,880
You found it.

138
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,360
Question, Justin.

139
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
Do you ever, when you're doing these books for your child,

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,880
do you ever open your mouth and surprise yourself

141
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,320
with how good you do at an impression you didn't know you could do before?

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,560
Yeah.

143
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm saying exactly like it is literally bizarre to reach into you

144
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,200
and figure out that there's an Edwin in there.

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,440
Yeah.

146
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,200
I've got an Edwin.

147
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
I've got an Edwin in me somewhere.

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
How about we do advice from other people or for other people

149
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,880
and the questions are from other people.

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,800
My roommate recently started bringing home mannequins for work

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
and putting them around the house.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
He said he does this because he doesn't want them to get thrown out.

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,600
At first I thought it was funny, but now we're completely overrun.

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,760
We have five complete mannequins around seven half busts heads and legs.

155
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
Three of the mannequins are children,

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
which he dresses in wigs and refuses to let me dress in clothing.

157
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm starting to get freaked out.

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,440
Should I get him to stop?

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,040
How do I tell him he has a problem?

160
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,200
Can I downsize the family without making him mad?

161
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
That's from Overman and Mannequins.

162
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
I want to take these questions in reverse order,

163
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,320
hit you with the answer to that first one and it's a big no.

164
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
You cannot.

165
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,080
They are his mannequin babies and you have to leave them unscathed and unnamed.

166
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,520
What if you took one of them away and told them that he had moved out?

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,680
Like, oh, Derek and I had a big fight and he got his own apartment.

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,240
That's an-

169
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
Derek the Mannequin doesn't live here anymore.

170
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,920
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,280
That's a very expensive grift,

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,160
because then you have to find a very flexible landlord

173
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,280
that's willing to rent to you on the Jeep to a mannequin.

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
So your roommate can go visit Derek?

175
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah, no, I got an address.

176
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Fuck you, I made it up.

177
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
Here's an address for him.

178
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Go visit them.

179
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
My credit check was a son of a bitch.

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Here's the thing.

181
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
The law of large numbers literally dictates

182
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,280
that if you bring home enough mannequins from work,

183
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,720
eventually one of them will be Kim Cattrall.

184
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,280
Right.

185
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

186
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah, definitely.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
So like this, it sounds like they're taking a sort of scattershot approach

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
to acquiring a Kim Cattrall.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
Because in the movie, which I have not seen,

190
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
I think that they just like go from store to store until they find a Kim Cattrall.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,880
Your roommate is taking a weird way of doing it,

192
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,040
just like planting Kim Cattrall seeds and hoping one of them blossoms.

193
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,320
Okay, but question, is it going to be Kim Cattrall from Mannequin

194
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
or will it be present day Kim Cattrall?

195
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm not sure I'm ready for all the double entendres

196
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,400
that a modern day Kim Cattrall, like, hey, listen.

197
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Well, she wouldn't be playing her character from Sex and the City.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Yeah, but she's a sexual woman.

199
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
She's an awakened sexual woman.

200
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,280
Wrote a book about sex and stuff, like she's down.

201
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,400
Like, I don't like, I'm not sure I'm ready to be like,

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,440
watching Whose Line Is It Anyway 2, The Rebirth.

203
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,400
And from behind my shoulder here, like, listen,

204
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,280
next time you're at the store, could you bring back some PVC

205
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,760
so I can make a donker for the guy next to me?

206
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,840
Because she loves the mannequin next to her.

207
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
She wants some extra PVC.

208
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,280
Make it long too, for his dick.

209
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
I need to lay some pipe.

210
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
If you know what I mean.

211
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
And then she just sits there.

212
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
And then she just sits there.

213
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
We've watched a lot of Sex and the City.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
For like 11 minutes.

215
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
Oh my god, law of large numbers.

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,840
If you bring enough back, you're gonna get chemical trial.

217
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
If you keep bringing them back,

218
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
you're gonna get Jeff from Today's Special.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,960
Oh my god.

220
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
It was a mannequin that only comes to life

221
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
in this Canadian kids TV show where he puts a magic hat.

222
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
That's never heard of bobby pins.

223
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
You never hear of bobby pins.

224
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Can't keep that motherfucker on.

225
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
People always trick it into taking it off

226
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
and turn it back into a mannequin.

227
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
People gotta say hocus pocus, alamagocus,

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
and get that motherfucker back.

229
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
But you can finally hook those two up.

230
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah.

231
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
They were meant to be together.

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
Where's my extremely specific shipping?

233
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Yeah.

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,640
Where is it?

235
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,360
Tumblo?

236
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
Tumblo?

237
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Where's my Jeff from Today's Special slash chemical trial?

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
I would like to do a dark reboot of Today's Special

239
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
where they have to trick him into getting the hat off

240
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
before the store opens

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
so he doesn't kill everyone that comes in.

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Yeah, because let's really address the facts if we can.

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
This Today's Special mannequin

245
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
is a ghost inhabiting the mannequin

246
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
and the only reason the ghost exists

247
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
is if they're killed in a terrible passion.

248
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,840
Uh-huh.

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
That's not accurate.

250
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
He was turned into a mannequin by a wizard

251
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
who gave him a magic hat.

252
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Wait, oh wait, hold on.

253
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,000
Was he turned from mannequin to man or man to mannequin?

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,880
Mannequin to man.

255
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
That's why he has to learn so much.

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
He doesn't know how to read and shit.

257
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,520
Like he has to learn everything about the world

258
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
hence like educational portion of the program.

259
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
So Justin, if I may, if I may ask a disturbing question.

260
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah.

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
He is mannequin.

262
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah.

263
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
He is hollow as a mannequin.

264
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Yeah.

265
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
When the hat is placed upon his head,

266
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,840
as the magic words are said,

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
does he suddenly fill up with organs?

268
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,160
Yeah.

269
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
And that's what's horrible.

270
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
If you turn your TV all the way up, you fucking hear it.

271
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,480
And it's like, listen, if you want a dark reboot,

272
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,640
you're gonna have to go pretty dark

273
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,960
because you are talking about a newborn fully grown man

274
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,920
that spends half of his days in a prison of death.

275
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,560
And also the night when Jody doesn't work.

276
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
He's also in a prison of death.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And PS, if Jody gets fired, he's locked in oblivion forever.

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
So it's already shades of gray, I would say,

279
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
in this children's selfish program.

280
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,960
So I know-

281
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,520
There's a lot of pressure put on Jody in this scenario.

282
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah.

283
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
So I know he can't read

284
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
and every time they take his hat off, he dies.

285
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,200
But can he fuck?

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,520
Hi, it's me, mannequin.

287
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,480
Get out of here.

288
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Hi, it's me, real mannequin, mannequin, the mannequin.

289
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,880
From mannequin?

290
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,480
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

291
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
No, I want to talk about today.

292
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,920
I want to keep addressing the issues with today's special.

293
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,440
The security guard was a puppet.

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,040
What if they made a sequel to Mannequin 2 called Ramekin?

295
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,680
And it was about a little serving dish for a creme brulee.

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
Did it come to life?

297
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
Did it come to life?

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,280
And then it was just-

299
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,880
And it would just be a mouth.

300
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,920
No, don't crack it.

301
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

302
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,520
Don't, no.

303
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
It's so hot.

304
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,480
Kill me.

305
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
Kill me.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,320
You're gonna blow too much.

307
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
That's a sad short life right there.

308
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,280
Filled with sweet cream, blow torched, cracked, and eaten.

309
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
I heard a rumor about a one-day-old mannequin man

310
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,080
that can really just give it to me.

311
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm a Ramekin.

312
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
Where would it even go?

313
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
We'll figure it out together.

314
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,440
So this direct-to-video sequel is voiced by Kim Cattrall as well.

315
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,580
Yes.

316
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
It's a crossover between Mannequin and Look Who's Talking 3.

317
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,480
Look Who's Talking 3, the babies are all Ramekins.

318
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,080
There have gotta be nights where Jodie has to stock the shelves

319
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,040
where she thinks to herself, like she goes to reach for the hat

320
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
and she's like, you know what?

321
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,840
I just can't tonight.

322
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
I can't really tonight.

323
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm actually way behind.

324
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
I have a lot of shit to do.

325
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
I cannot spend my night tutoring this mannequin person.

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
And then you go, okay, but that's bad

327
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,360
because the next thing she goes, puts the hat on and he's like,

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,720
Jodie, is it Thursday?

329
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
Is time to watch Survivor?

330
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,720
Oh, no.

331
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,360
Oh, God.

332
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
It's not time to watch Survivor.

333
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,320
Oh, because you always work Thursdays.

334
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,000
Is it Jodie Donnelly's Wednesday?

335
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,640
I'm so scared, Jodie.

336
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:06,960
Please.

337
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,000
The good thing is that a super horned-up Kim Cattrall

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
just smashes in through the front window like,

339
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Scree!

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,040
Oh, God.

341
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
See, this is why I don't put the hat on you every day.

342
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,400
I have to be in touch with the store manager at the Macy's

343
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,960
down the street to make sure we don't bring you guys to life

344
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,760
at the same time.

345
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,960
They can't breed.

346
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Oh, God.

347
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,640
They cannot breed.

348
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,760
This is so important.

349
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
Hey, Jeff, listen.

350
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Just for me this one time, take the hat off.

351
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,160
No, I really can't.

352
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
I can't, definitely can't do that.

353
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,360
Kimakin, I can't do that.

354
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
I can't do it, Kimakin.

355
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:47,920
Please.

356
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
Please love me for who I am, a beheaded man.

357
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

358
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah, for sure.

359
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,720
Got a Yahoo here.

360
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
And this one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

361
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
Thank you, Morgan Davey.

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Vladimir.

363
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,120
All caps, Vladimir asks,

364
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,880
I invented a bag that serves two main purposes.

365
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,920
Would like to pick the name for my project.

366
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,280
What do you guys think of name 50-50 bag?

367
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,360
What?

368
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,200
Okay, what's that?

369
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,880
I've really reached down into the depths of the imagisphere

370
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,320
and I've pulled out an idea nugget

371
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
for a bag that serves two purposes.

372
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,280
Would like to pick the name for the project.

373
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,520
Thinking about going with 50-50 bag.

374
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,120
What could it?

375
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,280
It's a bag, Justin.

376
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,600
Okay.

377
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah, I've had bags.

378
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
This is you.

379
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
This is you.

380
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Get bag, open bag, fill bag with pencils.

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Closed bag.

382
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,680
A pencil bag.

383
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,480
It's for one purpose.

384
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,040
It's a pencil bag.

385
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
This is my pencil bag.

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,960
Right.

387
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,440
You open up another bag and you put a bunch of cans of soda pop in it.

388
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
This is my soda pop bag.

389
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,960
And then this is you going to school.

390
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,760
I have two backpacks.

391
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm an idiot.

392
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,840
Right?

393
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,960
Right.

394
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
There's no better way, Griffin.

395
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,520
Think about your life and think about how inconvenient travel is in your life.

396
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
And then think about being able to sort of cut your travel weight

397
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,960
in half with this totally cool 50-50 bag.

398
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Okay, so you're saying it's a bag that I could put more than one different kind of thing in?

399
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,520
It serves two purposes.

400
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
That's against the law, I thought.

401
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
But aren't you worried about cross-contamination?

402
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
I mean, you don't want to put...

403
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,360
You're right, Travis.

404
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,080
There's certain things that just can't go in the 50-50 bag.

405
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
Raw meat can't go in the 50-50 bag.

406
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,720
No.

407
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
It simply can't.

408
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
Can I tell you guys a secret?

409
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,800
Yeah.

410
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,960
While Griffin was asking the question, I was distracted thinking about the name Vladimir,

411
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,520
and I thought that a really great name for a bong would be Vlad the Inhaler.

412
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
Yeah, that would be a very good name for a bong.

413
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,160
You're right, Travis.

414
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,280
Normally, I would scold you for such a diversion, but that's an excellent name that I hate to lose.

415
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
No, but you did a great job, Travie.

416
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,200
I hate to lose that to you.

417
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,600
Thank you.

418
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
It was a real...

419
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,240
It really got stuck in my brain, and I had to let it freeze

420
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,560
so that I could free myself from this brain prison.

421
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,120
Thank you.

422
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,920
It's good.

423
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
Let me posit this.

424
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,320
It's a bag that doesn't just store two things, because that's fucking crazy.

425
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,560
Right.

426
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,720
It's a bag that stores things and then does a completely second thing.

427
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
So you can put your pencils and soda in it.

428
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, of course.

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
I was being silly earlier when I insisted that you needed separate bags for those things.

430
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
So you can put your soda and your pencils and your push pops and your diaphragms

431
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
and all that stuff in them, right?

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,640
But then there's a second thing that it does, and maybe that second thing is it

433
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,880
makes soft serve ice cream or something.

434
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,720
It could double as maybe like a boombox or an umbrella or something practical.

435
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,800
Boombox would seem easy because speakers are like...

436
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
They'll put speakers in anything today, you know?

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
And Bluetooth, don't get me started.

438
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,680
None of us are really sure what it is or what it does.

439
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
Or how it works.

440
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,800
I have that button on my car and sometimes I push it and the word no appears on the car.

441
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,880
So I'm still not sure what Bluetooth is or does.

442
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,800
But what if the bag could do two things?

443
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,960
So one thing would be I put my stuff in it and I get on the airplane

444
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,680
and then I pick my bag up and I put it on my lap and my bag is a Game Boy Advance.

445
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay, okay.

446
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,280
What if you're traveling and you put like...

447
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,600
Everybody's got to take a suitcase these days with them on the plane.

448
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
Can't have any liquids in there, sorry.

449
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
Or take them out, up to you.

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,920
And printed on the bag as you get onto the plane is your boarding pass.

451
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Your bag can show your boarding pass.

452
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
That's pretty worthwhile.

453
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,200
What if it's a bag and it's also a bong called Vlad?

454
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
That's really good.

455
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah, it's good.

456
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Can you think about that?

457
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,040
You know like a camelback, right?

458
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,040
But instead it's like a bong and the tube runs up through the strap of the bag

459
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,160
and you just like take a little Vlad the inhale off of it.

460
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,800
So what if you...

461
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
It's a bummer that one of the two functions that this Justin Timberlake,

462
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,880
the 50-50 Experience bag has to have is carrying things.

463
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
Because that's wasting like one function of what I would want it to do.

464
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,440
I would rather have a bag in which you could not store things,

465
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
but it would count as your boarding pass

466
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:43,920
and also you could smoke that good, good green dust to reduce anxiety on a plane.

467
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,200
That's what this thing needs to be.

468
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
I don't have anything in this bag.

469
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,840
However, it is constantly displaying pornography on the outside mesh of the bag

470
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,160
and not still images, moving images.

471
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
Where's that technology?

472
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
Apple or Google or Amazon.

473
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,760
And then the second function that it does is it just like gets you really high very fast.

474
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,880
You know those helmets that have the two beer cans and then you drink from them?

475
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
Doesn't that seem to be a waste to have both of those be beer?

476
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
You know what I mean?

477
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,560
What if the other one was a water bong and then you go to board

478
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,960
and they're like, time to board, group four.

479
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,040
And you stroll up and you're like, did you say group 420?

480
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,400
And then you pound them both at the same time and they try to stop you.

481
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
And then you're like, show me in a book where this is illegal.

482
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,600
They can't.

483
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,000
They can't because there's no rule that says I can't have my 420 hat on.

484
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,320
Then they have to make one and then we have to stay ahead of the game.

485
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,360
I hate drug.

486
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,320
I wish it could be just like ranch and buffalo wings.

487
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,200
And the buffalo wing straw would have to be very big.

488
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
Or liquefied.

489
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
Maybe it's a little blender.

490
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,080
Maybe it's a little magic bullet that you put boneless or bonad wings into

491
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
and right before you're ready to consume you just blast them.

492
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,120
Yeah.

493
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,080
What if you had a bag that was a blender and everything you put into it just got blended

494
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,560
together?

495
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
And then the other and then but it also is constantly displaying pornography on the outside.

496
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,240
Yes.

497
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
And boarding passes.

498
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,640
And everyone in the pornography has a boarding pass that it's yours.

499
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
And you could never control if it was going to display a boarding pass or pornography.

500
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
It just happened at random and you just had to hope.

501
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Sir, you've been standing here 11 minutes.

502
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,480
I know.

503
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,360
Just wait a second.

504
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
OK, please.

505
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
It's going to pop up.

506
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,560
Where you been going?

507
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
It's illegal for you to ask me that question.

508
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
Just sit back and enjoy the show.

509
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
Can you please, Gnark?

510
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
I can't hear.

511
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,680
They can't hear the dialogue.

512
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,640
They can see out.

513
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
Well, it's one of those bags.

514
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
Wait, hold on.

515
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
It's a two way pornography screen?

516
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
It's a two way pornography screen.

517
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
Are you guys enjoying this?

518
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,760
How do you feel about this?

519
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,040
We're doing this for you.

520
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,000
We don't like this.

521
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,000
It's a pornography backpack where people can it's but it's they can see out and see you

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
through the screen of the pornography.

523
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,120
And it's also a jet pack.

524
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,520
So I kind of fly around Johnny Appleseed style.

525
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
But then I don't there's nothing in it.

526
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,760
I can't put anything in the daggone thing.

527
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
This dog, this dog gone thing.

528
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,600
There is nothing more unnerving than a two way pornography screen.

529
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,520
Even if they played it cool, when you boot up, you know there's going to be a reaction

530
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,040
like, oh, there he is.

531
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,120
Let's do it again.

532
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
What's up, Michael?

533
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Back again for more, huh?

534
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
All right, you wild dog.

535
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,720
Here's your bespoke pornography.

536
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,440
All right, Michael.

537
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Looks like you're waiting in line at a security checkpoint at an airport.

538
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
Hi, all of Michael's new friends.

539
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,040
Hey, everybody.

540
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
Hey, everybody.

541
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
This is Michael's thing.

542
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,440
We're all going to be characters from Supernatural, except we talk with really high pitched voices.

543
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
That's his thing.

544
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,040
Here we go.

545
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,080
My partner does a thing where they will sometimes pronounce words in the British way, even though

546
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
99% of the way they speak is with an American accent.

547
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
But here's the catch.

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Their mom is British and their dad is American.

549
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
And they spent most of their time growing up in the US, but they insist on pronouncing

550
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,280
words like herb with a hard H.

551
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
Oh, looks like, did you do that on purpose?

552
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,640
Okay, it's impossible to like tell whether or not you did that on purpose.

553
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
I read ahead a little bit with a hard H.

554
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm professional.

555
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,400
I feel like they ought to go all in one way or another, but what do you think?

556
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,280
And that's from going loony in Las Vegas.

557
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,320
The great thing about the American language, and by which I meant accent, is that much

558
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,520
like America itself, it's a melange of beautiful dialects.

559
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
Sure, yeah, yeah.

560
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,640
It's why I think it's the most beautiful language.

561
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
Language of love, they say.

562
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
The language of love.

563
00:24:51,680 --> 00:25:01,280
So what you need to understand is if this person went either 100% American or 100% British,

564
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,440
in both cases, the things that they said would be completely unintelligible.

565
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,520
Mm-hmm, because 100% American would just be like,

566
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
and 100% British would just be like-

567
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
Did you just sing Return to Innocence?

568
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,120
And then the 100% British would just be like,

569
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,280
and you need the mix in there.

570
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
Sure, you need the melange.

571
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:39,040
You need the melange, or else it's just- The question is the blend.

572
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,400
Because if your partner does this, yeah, we had some leftovers,

573
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,280
so we wrapped it up in the aluminum foil.

574
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,640
You gotta feather the edges, you know what I mean?

575
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,520
But I could see where like, if your mom said herb, and then that's the way you heard it,

576
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,480
like you just wanted to say herb, you're right.

577
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,920
You could say that, right?

578
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,720
You could.

579
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,160
Yeah, that's fine, right?

580
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,320
Yeah, I get a lift.

581
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,280
I get a lot of- That's what I'm saying.

582
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
If you're not drawing attention to it,

583
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,800
if you're not doing like the, I spent a semester in France,

584
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,320
and so now I pronounce French words all hoity-toity,

585
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,920
if you're saying it because that's how you learned to say it, I think it's okay.

586
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,800
Okay. 100% French would be like-

587
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,520
Yeah, it would sound like someone was waking you up at three in the morning,

588
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,280
and you had to try to get up off a waterbed.

589
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,640
That's what- Sounds like a motorcycle in a glass jar.

590
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,120
Exactly.

591
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm not making fun of these languages, by the way.

592
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,840
New Zealand would be like- I'm just saying you need the other mix in there

593
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,800
to produce the fucking consonant noises.

594
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,080
It's like music, if Skrillex just did bass, it would be unintelligible.

595
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,800
If he just did treble, if he just did jazz trumpet.

596
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,760
Hey guys, I'm Skrillex.

597
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Here's my new song, and I'm just moving in a new direction.

598
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,520
It is all treble.

599
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,240
It's called Keep It Easy.

600
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,040
Here we go.

601
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,360
Time to, well, I was gonna say rock with this.

602
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,200
And here's my new style, and it's just all fat bass drops.

603
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
Oh shit, you're all skeletons. How did that happen?

604
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,080
So even full bass Skrillex sounds like full treble Skrillex?

605
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,680
I thought that was an identity.

606
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
Well, the band doesn't change.

607
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,080
His fucking voice wouldn't change, you dumb idiot.

608
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
Of course it wouldn't, just the music.

609
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,080
The one that fucks me up about this is country names.

610
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,040
Imagine when we were at Mexico, and we're like, so how do you say it?

611
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,560
And they're like, Mexico? And you're like, I don't think so.

612
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,200
We're gonna go ahead and just go full crackers on it.

613
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,040
Go ahead and get that X in there, it's fun.

614
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,320
Isn't it Mexico?

615
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
You guys can steal it if you want.

616
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,200
No, we're good.

617
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,840
No, we're good.

618
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
Like the way we say it is good.

619
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,680
We're just gonna stick with Mexico, if that's okay.

620
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
I've always thought about that, when those countries have their own name,

621
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,400
but there's English versions of their name.

622
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,840
Like, we should just say their name the way it's pronounced.

623
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,720
That's what I'm saying.

624
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
That's what, yes, that is the, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

625
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
Who was the person that came up with the different language names

626
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
for the different places?

627
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,400
Because like, Japan is Nihon, in the Japanese style, right?

628
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
But we just call it Japan.

629
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,680
And who was just like, what's this one called?

630
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,160
Japan, nailed it, crushed it, next one.

631
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
Next country.

632
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
Next country, please.

633
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,040
Okay, this one's Zealand, and there's a smaller one next to it.

634
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,440
That's New Zealand, because I just learned about it.

635
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,000
Moving on.

636
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,400
It's new in my idiot brain.

637
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
New, I'm idiot.

638
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
Maybe it's punishment for, because we have a lot of people coming from England,

639
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
and like, they had so many country names there.

640
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
Like, what's your country called?

641
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,920
Uh, it's called a lot of things, Gov.

642
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,280
It's like, UK, and Britain, and England.

643
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
Get it together, guys.

644
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Just pick a name.

645
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,560
Some people just call it Europe.

646
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,520
Some people call it London, which is like, buck, buckwild.

647
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,880
But it's crazy.

648
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
It's crazy that that's not what the American one, like, that one didn't stick.

649
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,600
Your country's called London now, because we make the rules.

650
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
We're in charge here.

651
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,000
You're called, um, Tokyo's house, because it's where Tokyo lives.

652
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
I think we did a pretty good job.

653
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,360
It's called Tokyo's butt crib, and it comes on 8pm every Wednesday on MTV3.

654
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,120
It's just about Tokyo just trying to get by, you know?

655
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,840
Just trying to make it.

656
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
Trying to find their way.

657
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,240
Preview for season two, he gets a baby!

658
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
And then it's a literal crib.

659
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,960
Oh, I see.

660
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,800
Yeah, it works on a lot of levels.

661
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,840
Uh, hey, why don't we take a quick break from the fun to visit the Money Zone?

662
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:10,000
I wish this character that we invented in that last bit could have been on the old

663
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
We're in the World with Carmen Sandiego show.

664
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,480
To just be like, um, Scotland's Hat.

665
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
What are you talking about?

666
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,480
It's in Scotland's Hat!

667
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,640
Africa Island!

668
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you mean Madagascar?

669
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
What are you talking about?

670
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
The island of Africa!

671
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,360
Off it!

672
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,520
Off of Africa.

673
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,400
Tiny Africa!

674
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,680
Our dick!

675
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,720
It's Florida.

676
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm done.

677
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,280
Listen, if you like wine but don't know as much about it as you'd like to, we have the

678
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,560
perfect solution for you.

679
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
It's called Club W.

680
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,480
It is a service where you can tell them the kind of flavors you like.

681
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,520
You don't tell them types of wine.

682
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,640
You tell them, you know, how do you like your meat cooked?

683
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,560
How do you like berries or chocolate?

684
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,480
Like dark flavors, light flavors, whatever.

685
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,680
And they're going to pick the wines that are going to match your palette.

686
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
You know what I like about it?

687
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
Tell me, Travis.

688
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,640
When they send it to you, they send it to you with a card that describes the wine and

689
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,520
not only describes the wine, like describes what you might pair it with or what kind of

690
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,920
event.

691
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,960
And it's never like fancy events that you like can't relate to.

692
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,600
It's like, oh, having pizza and watching a football game.

693
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
This is a good wine for that.

694
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
And it's like, oh, OK.

695
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,440
That's like a thing that I actually wanted to know.

696
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
Thank you very much.

697
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,600
They'll tell you which, like when you put a canister of the Club W wine into your 50-50

698
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,640
bag hat, it'll tell you what to put in the other half of it to like combo the flavors.

699
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
So like maybe you want like a Panda Express orange chicken.

700
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,680
60% cacao, bittersweet chocolates.

701
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,200
Yeah, it's good stuff.

702
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Right now, Club W is offering our listeners $20 off your first order when you go to clubw.com

703
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,360
slash my brother.

704
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,480
And it gets even better.

705
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,520
You don't want to pay for shipping.

706
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,080
So Club W will actually cover your shipping on orders of four bottles or more.

707
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,680
So take something off your to-do list.

708
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,000
Go to clubw.com slash my brother and get $20 off your first order now.

709
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,440
That's clubw.com slash my brother.

710
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,440
Can I tell you about Harry's?

711
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,800
Oh, yeah.

712
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,400
Let me start off.

713
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,160
Before I tell you about Harry's, I'm going to set the backstage.

714
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,680
Oh, God, why do you tease us like this?

715
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,360
It's so important for an advertisement.

716
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,400
The current way that most stores do razors is bullshit and garbage,

717
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
and they should be ashamed of themselves.

718
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm talking about you, Walgreens.

719
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm talking about you, CVS.

720
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,520
Probably talking about you, Walmart.

721
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,640
I got my eye on you.

722
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
Talking about you, Fruth Pharmacy.

723
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
Fruth Rite Aid.

724
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,920
You, shame on you.

725
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
Your Dwayne's Reed.

726
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,720
They lock their razors in plexiglass cases like the razors are common criminals or perhaps

727
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Pokemon trapped in Pokeballs, and when you stop to think about it, it's because those

728
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,800
razors cost $140 each, and people are just going to steal them just so they can have

729
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,720
a clean, smooth face or legs or whatever.

730
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,360
Harry's, it cuts out the middleman, cuts out all the bad stuff in the process of getting

731
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,560
these razors onto your face or legs.

732
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,920
These are quality German-engineered five-bladed cartridges.

733
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,000
Give you a close, comfy shave, and you'll get a full refund if you're not happy,

734
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,560
and you get factory direct prices.

735
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,240
That's how they get them to you so cheap.

736
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Harry's Truman Starter Set is a great option for new customers, and it's an amazing deal.

737
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,000
For just $15, you get a razor handle, you get moisturizing shave cream, you get three

738
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,840
of Harry's five-blade German-engineered razors, and the best part is they're going to give

739
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,680
our listeners five bucks off their first purchase.

740
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,080
Just go to harys.com, harys.com, and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

741
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,680
That's harys.com, and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

742
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,000
All right, can I, as long as we're asking if we can do things, can I read a Jumbotron

743
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,480
message?

744
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,240
I wish you would.

745
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,800
Thank you.

746
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,360
This is for Colton and Taylor.

747
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,080
It's from Jeremy Quinn and Lonnie.

748
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,240
Congratulations on marrying each other.

749
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,880
Colton, don't pee in Taylor's closet unless she's into that.

750
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,560
Then you keep doing you.

751
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,680
Taylor, if you didn't know about that before, you do now.

752
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,800
Have a great marriage.

753
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,280
A lot to unpack here.

754
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,640
Yeah, but here's what I want to unpack.

755
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,520
Their preferred time frame for this message is late July.

756
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,520
We sunk it from downtown.

757
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,920
Hell yeah, great timing, Jeremy Quinn and little Lonnie.

758
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,480
But that means that this message has been sitting on the shelf for a few months, and

759
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:29,360
at this point, I think Taylor knows all about Colton's dark secret vis-a-vis closet piss.

760
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,080
No, we have to assume that they just got married, right?

761
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,680
Oh, that's possible, and they didn't, okay.

762
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,480
Okay.

763
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
That would be a weird thing otherwise.

764
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,360
Like, they're getting married in February, but we want to hold it out a little bit.

765
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,360
We want to let it really soak in, like the urine on the closet carpet.

766
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,720
You're going to get married in February, but we're going to piss shame you late summer.

767
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,800
Catch it.

768
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,920
Catch the piss shame.

769
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,760
Sweep in the nation.

770
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,880
So happy marriage.

771
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,120
I want to tell everybody about the Up for Discussion podcast on iTunes and SoundCloud.

772
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:12,000
It is a brilliant audio experience for your ears, where a panel of genius babies discuss

773
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,560
current affairs, past affairs, pasta affairs, pop culture, rock vultures, and everything

774
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,080
important for the whole world, hosted by Tim Blase of Acapella Science and his two-way

775
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,640
funnier but less famous friends, Tom and Simon.

776
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,200
That's called Up for Discussion, and it is available on iTunes and also SoundCloud.

777
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
I heard that on the new episode they got Wayne Brady.

778
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,760
Damn, that's a big get.

779
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
But not that Wayne Brady.

780
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Okay.

781
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,560
Oh, okay.

782
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay.

783
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
Wayne S. Brady.

784
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,680
Wayne Dwayne Brady.

785
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,320
He does improv, but he's, like, so bad at it.

786
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
So super bad at it.

787
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,640
And so, like, really, this is an intervention that the Up for Discussion podcast has with

788
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,760
Wayne the Dwayne Brady.

789
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
So that's going to be a big episode.

790
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:31,920
Just search iTunes for Up for Discussion, and you can start enjoying it right now.

791
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Stand up from Aparna Nonchurla, Phoebe Robinson, Kevin Avery, Joel Kim Booster, and way more.

Do it.

796
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,400
I got a Yahoo here.

797
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,520
This one was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

798
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,080
Thank you, Rachel.

799
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

800
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:09,760
We'll call them... Evil Wayne Brady asks, how do they film a movie inside a movie?

801
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
For example, the movie Scream 3.

802
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,280
They were filming a movie inside of the movie called Stab 3, I believe.

803
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,120
God, I hope that's not true.

804
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,240
I have not seen the third Scream, but I hope they did not film a movie inside of it called

805
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,480
Stab 3. I wondered how they do...

806
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
How do they do that?

807
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,240
The house they used in the movie production Stab 3 was the house from the first Scream

808
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,800
franchise.

809
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,600
How is it done?

810
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro is the name of the film.

811
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,040
Fuck.

812
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,920
Wow, what a bad...

813
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,120
Wow, what a bad thing.

814
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,320
I mean, Scream 3 seems like a bad title in like a vacuum.

815
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,000
To be fair, Grav, I also imagine they were trying to do the bad horror movie in the horror

816
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
movie thing.

817
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,520
But this isn't like bad campy horror movie.

818
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,120
This is like if they called Superman Fly.

819
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,640
Punch.

820
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,920
Punch.

821
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,720
Punchman.

822
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,840
Punch flyer.

823
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,560
No, because that's two verbs.

824
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:12,800
Okay.

825
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
This is a single one.

826
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,080
Hey, have you seen that new movie?

827
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,560
Drive.

828
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,640
Okay, that works.

829
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,200
That tracks.

830
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
Crash.

831
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
Flight.

832
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,240
I could go on.

833
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,400
So how do they...

834
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,920
But it's a good question, I think.

835
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,880
Because...

836
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
How do you make the movie...

837
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
So like you're making a movie.

838
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,240
Okay, I'm making Tron.

839
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Okay.

840
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
They don't make a movie in that one.

841
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm making a movie, right?

842
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm making...

843
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,320
What's a movie where they make the movie?

844
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
Oh, um...

845
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

846
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,440
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

847
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,680
Yeah.

848
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,920
And they're in there and they're telling so many boner jokes

849
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
and I'm fucking loving it.

850
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,760
But then I see them making a movie inside the movie

851
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
and I'm like, how did they do it?

852
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,840
How do they do it?

853
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,600
It's all about inventing backstory.

854
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,840
Because you have to create in the world,

855
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,680
you have to create a studio that's gonna make that movie.

856
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
You gotta create somebody who's the head of that studio.

857
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,720
What's his family like?

858
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,440
How did he get there?

859
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,000
What led him?

860
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
Where did he go to school to get his film degree?

861
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,640
You know what I mean?

862
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,880
You gotta go all the way back or no one's ever gonna believe

863
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,080
that they're actually making that movie.

864
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,600
Okay, think about this for a second.

865
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,080
Here's the weirdest thing about making a movie in a movie, okay?

866
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
You have to get other cameras, right?

867
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,000
That's fine.

868
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
That's fine and expected.

869
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,120
But like, you're gonna have to cast people to be the guy.

870
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,680
Like, you know the guy who holds the boom mic is kind of like,

871
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,120
you know, I could just be in the movie.

872
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,760
We need you to hold the boom mic over the guy holding the boom mic.

873
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
We need you to hold the boom mic over that guy.

874
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,600
It's like, okay, why don't we just trade?

875
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,480
Like, I can show him how to hold it and I'll be in it.

876
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
That's how Craig T. Nelson got his start.

877
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,840
Oh, really?

878
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
Yeah, he was the best boy.

879
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,440
And then he was like, what do best boys do?

880
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
And everybody's like, I don't know.

881
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
I think it's just like a good luck thing.

882
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,280
And then Craig T. Nelson, who was like 16 at the time,

883
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,960
knee high to a frog was just like, wait, you're telling me there's a position.

884
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,920
Hold on, everybody stop shooting.

885
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
Stop production on the movie.

886
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
Stop the production on Gone with the Wind.

887
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,960
Okay, so if I'm to be understood, there's a position,

888
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
and this is all Craig T. Nelson.

889
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
There's a position on film production.

890
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
I assume you do more of a voice.

891
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
There's a, he's 16.

892
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,240
There's a position in film production called best boy.

893
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,520
And it's just a boy who's very lucky

894
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,920
and they keep him there to ward off evil movie spirits?

895
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,280
Yeah, that's right.

896
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,280
This place is haunted.

897
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
Greta Garbo's just up in here haunting the place the fuck up.

898
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,240
And you got to keep her away from us,

899
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,320
Craig T. Nelson with his good luck boy charms.

900
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,800
Anyway, to be fair, it did turn out just to be old man McGillicuddy,

901
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
who was trying to drive away the movie studio

902
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,560
so he could open back up his amusement park.

903
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,880
But then he did die and started to haunt the place.

904
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
And Craig T. Nelson was the only one that could stop him.

905
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,560
Anyway, somebody was like, Craig T. Nelson,

906
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,680
I love your style and I love your passion.

907
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
I want you to be in my poltergeist.

908
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,840
Then that's how it happened.

909
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,720
And he was like, I don't know.

910
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,360
That sounds like it's going to be a ghostly film.

911
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,840
And they're like, yeah, that's exactly why we need you for this.

912
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,280
That would be a fun job interview.

913
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
Like, Craig T. Nelson, how can you prove

914
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,400
that you're a very lucky boy whose ghosts are afraid of?

915
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
It's like, hey, listen, I'm 60 years old.

916
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
I haven't gotten killed by a ghost yet.

917
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,640
So I got a pretty good track record going.

918
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,520
He makes a good point.

919
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
Those are all the people in the room agreeing.

920
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
They're also from Australia.

921
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,240
That's why they sound like that.

922
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,960
Craig T. Nelson is basically a human chain letter.

923
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,460
OK.

924
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,960
Where if you don't kiss him, you'll die within one day.

925
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,440
Within seven days, if you don't kiss Craig T. Nelson

926
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
and you see him, but you don't kiss him,

927
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
it's like not forwarding a chain letter.

928
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,560
And it's bad, bad luck.

929
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
Do you have to keep coming back to kiss him?

930
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,200
Or is it just like, upon seeing him,

931
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,720
you have 24 hours to kiss him?

932
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,160
Yes, exactly.

933
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,360
Well, you really said the first half of that

934
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,040
and then just leapt off the building, huh?

935
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,720
Just hoping Edwin would be there to catch you.

936
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,520
Oh, I don't know if you're talking to me or Travis.

937
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,120
We both said some really dumb shit just then.

938
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,600
Here's another question.

939
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm a rock climber, and I got a lot of friends that climb, too.

940
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,920
Well, they're great friends.

941
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
I don't exactly trust them all to belay me.

942
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,520
Oh, that means basically catch me if I fall.

943
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,400
And just say that.

944
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,240
God, these people sometimes.

945
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,040
So I think, isn't belay where they're on like the other end

946
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,000
of the rope and they're going like this?

947
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,320
Yeah, so they're holding the rope that you are hanging from.

948
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,080
They're not just standing under you,

949
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,440
like waiting to catch you.

950
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,320
Oh my God, I just-

951
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,880
I have a bunch of skinny ass little boned friends

952
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,720
that I will absolutely destroy.

953
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,760
I just understood like half the lines in Terra Nova better.

954
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,260
Cool.

955
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,640
How do I keep my friends?

956
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,320
Okay, they seem to find it offensive

957
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,800
when I tell them I don't want them to belay me.

958
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,080
How do I keep my friends

959
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,160
without having to worry about getting dropped?

960
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,840
And that's from living on the edge

961
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,040
and hopefully staying that way.

962
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
You definitely shouldn't let them belay you

963
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
after you've offended them by telling them

964
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,240
that you don't want them to belay you.

965
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,200
Oh yeah, no, this ship has definitely sailed at this point,

966
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,760
but if you were to have come to us before,

967
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
you told all your friends that they're weak.

968
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,040
They're fucking so weak.

969
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
You can't control this.

970
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
You can't control this rock climbing girth.

971
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm like a bull running up that mountain.

972
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,200
You can't control this.

973
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,160
It's so funny to me.

974
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,240
You went with strength, didn't trust them.

975
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,200
And I went with like shady character, didn't trust them.

976
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,680
Yeah.

977
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,080
Like maybe this is like a soap opera scenario

978
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,800
where they're trying to like steal your,

979
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,280
I don't know, oil drilling empire

980
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
and maybe also your wife.

981
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
And so they might let you drop in a climbing accident,

982
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,080
but then it turns out that you have steel bones.

983
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,560
So you survive and a witch doctor heals you,

984
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
but now you're played by a different actor.

985
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,680
Like that kind of thing.

986
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,240
Interesting.

987
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,720
You know.

988
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,760
I'm surprised you guys don't think reverse psychology

989
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,520
is like a pretty good way to go here.

990
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,640
Like telling people that they're weak babies

991
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,520
and like they could never contain your climbing prowess

992
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,160
seems like a pretty good way to get people to hold on

993
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,840
for the ride of their lives, you know?

994
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:12,800
Yeah.

995
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
The problem is you can't really test it.

996
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,960
You can't be like, hold on, I'm going to jump.

997
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,080
We'll see how you do.

998
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,440
This will be your test run.

999
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,640
Yeah.

1000
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,280
But that's every person who's ever carried you, right?

1001
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,680
Like you got to, at some point, it's an act of faith.

1002
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,000
You got to-

1003
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,720
That's beautiful, Justin.

1004
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,840
See, this is why I only make big, strong, dependable friends.

1005
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,080
Sure.

1006
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, I go out with my friends and people like look at us

1007
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,600
like we're shooting the new sequel, The Magic Mike,

1008
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,160
all with different actors like Tokyo Drift style

1009
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,800
because we're just all so big and fucking strong and dependable.

1010
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,160
They depend-

1011
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,080
Because the two things don't matter without each other.

1012
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,720
They have to be built like fucking bulls

1013
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,960
and as dependable as a bull would be.

1014
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,600
But in every group, Griffin, there has to be a weakest one.

1015
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
So you have to have to, like they can't be like,

1016
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,040
like they can't all be equally strong.

1017
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,600
Yeah, that's me.

1018
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,040
That's obviously me.

1019
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,400
So then how do you feel when like Beefy Greg says like,

1020
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,080
I don't want Griffin to belay me.

1021
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,720
I feel fine about that because I'm probably off catching Pokemon.

1022
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,440
Enjoying some watercress sandwiches in the middle.

1023
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,400
How do you not understand, Travis,

1024
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,200
that that is the fucking dream scenario for-

1025
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,200
It's like being in the person in the front of a back massage chain.

1026
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,960
Like I don't have to hold up these massive fucking beefcakes

1027
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,400
that I go climb in with and real climbers

1028
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
really pronounce the B in the middle there.

1029
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,720
They're really in it.

1030
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
Well, you were raised by British people.

1031
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,520
I think that this is a good point, Griffin,

1032
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
because I think our question asker is,

1033
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,080
I personally, if my friend said,

1034
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,000
you don't have to do the thing.

1035
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,200
You don't have to be responsible for my health and well-being.

1036
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,960
You can just like sit there and have a beer.

1037
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,920
I'd be like, yes.

1038
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,720
This is exactly what I was hoping you would say.

1039
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
I don't want to be responsible for your life.

1040
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,040
That is not heat I need.

1041
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,880
I want to talk about something

1042
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,800
that is underneath the surface of all this,

1043
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,920
and it'll be a brief diversion,

1044
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,360
but I do want to touch on it.

1045
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:07,920
And this is the-

1046
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,560
Racism.

1047
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
It's a decision to go rock climbing.

1048
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,840
No, it's a decision to go rock climbing in the first place.

1049
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,080
Who is looking at the world and thinks,

1050
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,360
you know what I need from my life?

1051
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,040
Scarier.

1052
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,320
I would like it to be scarier on a daily basis.

1053
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,120
I would like it to be scarier and up more.

1054
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,760
Up more, like a higher?

1055
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,200
Now if it's like practice, we're like,

1056
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,800
listen, I'm going to need to get out of here.

1057
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,320
I'm going to need to get out of here quick.

1058
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,080
And so the additional methods of getting out of here

1059
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,440
may not be available to me.

1060
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
I'm into that.

1061
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,520
That's fine.

1062
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,120
That I would also allow you

1063
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,120
if you wanted to start learning how to do the suction cup thing

1064
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,040
with climbing up tall buildings like that.

1065
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,840
I'm into that too.

1066
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,720
If it's a method of egress and you're training yourself,

1067
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,280
that's fine.

1068
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,360
But you're saying people who look at the Matterhorn are like,

1069
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,400
I want to fuck that.

1070
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,560
You're like, I don't want to fuck that.

1071
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,240
I'd rather not fuck that today.

1072
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,560
Not at this juncture.

1073
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,400
I hate walking up steps for many reasons.

1074
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,320
One is tiring.

1075
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,120
And two, if I slip and fall and die on the steps,

1076
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,080
it's not a good look.

1077
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
But I will say, Justin, there is something about like,

1078
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,480
if you're going to slip and fall,

1079
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,360
falling off a mountain, not a bad way to go.

1080
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,160
I mean, it's at least cooler than falling down steps.

1081
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
Well, yeah, because you deploy that fucking wing suit

1082
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,080
on your way down.

1083
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,640
Hell yeah.

1084
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,040
Can you belay yourself?

1085
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Yeah, you can if you get a rib removed.

1086
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,040
Um, how about another question?

1087
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,720
Oh, you like that one?

1088
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,040
It's a tasty one more.

1089
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,080
Um, do the one above the break.

1090
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,520
Okay, when there is only a little bit of chip dip left

1091
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
in the container, I'll sometimes crush chips up

1092
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
and make it into like a Frito pie.

1093
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,680
Alternatively, if there are only chip crumbs left,

1094
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,120
I'll mix them up with a bit of dip.

1095
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,240
Okay, we're talking.

1096
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,120
Okay, my wife, I get it.

1097
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,720
My wife thinks it's disgusting.

1098
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,440
Am I good?

1099
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,280
That's from Munch Squad Goals in West Texas.

1100
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,440
I do like that it's Munch Squad Goals in West Texas

1101
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,800
because this like, this person works at Whataburger

1102
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
and has listened to Munch Squad and it's like,

1103
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,000
it's time for me to get bold.

1104
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,840
It's time for this brand to get bold.

1105
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,960
Here's my new thing.

1106
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,440
Dip leavens topping for burgers.

1107
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
Okay, in defense of this person,

1108
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
what else are you supposed to do with the shit?

1109
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,960
You pay for it.

1110
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
It's food.

1111
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
Why wouldn't you consume it?

1112
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,400
It is food.

1113
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,480
Yeah, it's food.

1114
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
It's good mood food.

1115
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
Okay, you get to the bottom of the tortilla chip bag

1116
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,080
and it's not just like dust, but the chips are so small

1117
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,720
that like you can't get a good scoop going.

1118
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,360
Yeah.

1119
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,640
What are you supposed to do?

1120
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,000
I mean, you're supposed to like blast your like proboscis

1121
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,440
down there and just like sweep up,

1122
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,280
but that's ghoulish too.

1123
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,120
I do like that.

1124
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,160
Hey, do you guys, when you're at the bottom of a pretzel bag,

1125
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,440
do you guys ever up end it and just like ride the salt way?

1126
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,720
Oh, just punish yourself?

1127
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
Just huff that sack.

1128
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,320
Just huff the sack?

1129
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,560
Oh, this is so upsetting, this question is.

1130
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,120
I don't know why I did it.

1131
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,160
I don't think so at all.

1132
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,600
You eat it with a spoon.

1133
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,600
It's like salsa cereal.

1134
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,520
Oh my God, holy shit.

1135
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,960
That's so gross.

1136
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,280
That's the grossest way you could have said it.

1137
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,320
Why is that gross?

1138
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
You pour milk over your Cheerios?

1139
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,920
You pour salsa over your chips?

1140
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,240
Listen, I understand where your mental roadblock is,

1141
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,200
but ideologically, it's the same thing.

1142
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,600
Whether you scoop the chip or you eat it with a spoon,

1143
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,360
it's the same thing.

1144
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,400
Don't let your old world ideas of how the chip and dip experience

1145
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,560
is supposed to go stop you.

1146
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,800
Like with a spoon, you don't get it all over your feeners.

1147
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,640
You're not going to drop it on your shirt.

1148
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,920
Your feeners?

1149
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,800
On your feeners.

1150
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,080
You're not going to get it on your shirt.

1151
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,040
It's going to be a lot smoother of a process with a spoon.

1152
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,840
I don't know why you're letting your archaic understanding-

1153
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,600
You're not going to get it on your feeners?

1154
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,760
I've got salsa on my feeners.

1155
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,920
I've got chip crumbles-

1156
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,280
I've got chip crumbles on my food rags.

1157
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,720
Young Darryl Dawkins licked those feeners at the dinner table.

1158
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,720
I left my feeners stuck in the guacamole till you could get

1159
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,000
some prune and you got to wipe them off on my food rags.

1160
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,600
I got mole on my feeners.

1161
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,520
Got mole on my feeners again.

1162
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,320
Got it on my good jersey.

1163
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,000
I got to wipe the guacamole on my jersey.

1164
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,800
Got it on my feeners.

1165
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,240
Get these feeners clean.

1166
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,320
Feeners.

1167
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,800
Okay, so first off, before we wrap up here,

1168
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,440
we wanted to remind you that we are selling an expansion

1169
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,240
of the card game Man- Monikers, not Manikers.

1170
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,960
That's a different thing.

1171
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,920
It's a card game mannequin.

1172
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,520
Here's how it works.

1173
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,400
You collect five mannequins and it happens.

1174
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,440
You kill your roommates.

1175
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,600
You have got, as of listening to this, 16 days left to preorder

1176
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,520
this for just $10 and that's it.

1177
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,480
After you preorder it, that is all we're doing

1178
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,920
for the time being.

1179
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,360
That's all we're planning on doing, I should say.

1180
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,280
Manikers is a game that's sort of like

1181
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,640
an elevated form of charades.

1182
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,240
We've all played it and thought it was hysterical

1183
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,760
long before we agreed to do this.

1184
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,800
And so we decided to make our own expansion.

1185
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,120
It's based on all the different shows that we make

1186
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,200
with cards based on everyone,

1187
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,480
mostly my brother and me.

1188
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,480
But there's a lot of general interest cards in there

1189
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,040
of things that you don't have to listen to the show to get.

1190
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,840
So if you wanna play with other people,

1191
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,520
you'll be able to.

1192
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,440
That'll be even easier if you preorder it

1193
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,320
with the Manikers itself for 35 bucks.

1194
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,640
And then there's a ton of things that have nothing to do

1195
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,160
with our dumb show whatsoever.

1196
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,880
But it's so fun.

1197
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
It's like, it is my favorite party game to play.

1198
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It is a dependable party game that like takes

1199
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,800
what is fun about charades and makes it even better.

1200
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,560
And it's all about like teamwork and memory

1201
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,320
and just making an ass of yourself.

1202
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,840
It's really, really, really great.

1203
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,680
And we hand wrote the text on all the different cards

1204
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,360
and there's gonna be art on some of them

1205
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,480
that should be really cool.

1206
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,720
And we're super excited about it.

1207
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,960
And you've only got 16 days and then that's it.

1208
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,280
We are not selling them like as a product afterwards.

1209
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,720
We're only doing pre-orders.

1210
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,080
So please, please do not sleep.

1211
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,560
A portion of sales that will go to an organization

1212
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,440
called Grow, which is based in Huntington.

1213
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,760
And they're doing urban farming to help people

1214
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,240
who are in addiction recovery to give them another place

1215
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,840
to sort of focus their energies.

1216
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,160
And it's a really, really cool project.

1217
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,240
I met with the organizer and she has really great plans

1218
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,560
for the place and we wanna do something to help out.

1219
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,960
So for every one of those you purchase,

1220
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,640
we're gonna donate some money to them,

1221
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,840
which is a really exciting way to sweeten it for you

1222
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,800
if you wanna get a good vibe from also getting something fun.

1223
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,560
So mackleroycollection.com is the address.

1224
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,280
Go there right now.

1225
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,320
You've only got 16 days.

1226
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,280
Don't wait, don't sleep.

1227
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,160
You won't forget.

1228
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,040
Go get it right now.

1229
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,840
So as you guys know, we're working on,

1230
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,800
or maybe you don't, but like we're doing a TV show with CSO.

1231
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,880
It's gonna be great.

1232
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,840
My brother and my brother and me, all new, a visual element,

1233
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,360
but we're gonna need your help with it.

1234
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,800
We're gonna need some questions from you.

1235
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
We're working on a submission form for that right now.

1236
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,800
It's gonna be online so everybody can submit their questions

1237
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,000
just like you do for the show.

1238
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,280
So start thinking about your questions.

1239
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,360
You know, same rules we do for the show.

1240
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,640
They need to be concise.

1241
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,320
They need to be actual, you know, requests for advice

1242
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,880
and not just like, what do you guys think about bread?

1243
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,480
But like a real thing.

1244
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,520
We can help you with something

1245
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,120
that's actually going on in your life.

1246
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,640
No bummers, but not so whimsical as to appear silly.

1247
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,320
And yeah, just pay attention to-

1248
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,840
Sorry, what was the last one, Travis?

1249
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,240
Just no whimsy?

1250
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,280
Not so whimsical.

1251
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,240
Not so whimsical as to appear silly.

1252
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,680
There are guidelines that I wrote

1253
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,960
that you can definitely read

1254
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,320
once you go to submit your questions.

1255
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,960
They'll help- Yeah, they'll be better than this.

1256
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,320
But we don't have a link for that yet.

1257
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,080
But as soon as we have one,

1258
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,560
it'll be on our Facebook page and on our Twitter.

1259
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,480
And then of course, you know, next episode

1260
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,800
when we have a link, hopefully by the next week,

1261
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,920
we'll share it with you.

1262
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,200
But we just wanna give you a heads up.

1263
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,760
We'll hitch up.

1264
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,680
We are gonna be at Max Fun Con East.

1265
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,880
Are there any tickets left?

1266
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,600
Don't know.

1267
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,560
There were just a handful.

1268
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,120
There were like nine available on Friday.

1269
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,480
So they may all be gone.

1270
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,200
If not, run, do not walk to get these tickets.

1271
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,800
It may be an active competition.

1272
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,600
It may be completely over.

1273
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,680
We're doing, we're not doing my bit in there.

1274
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,800
We're actually doing Adventure Zone.

1275
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,320
It's gonna be really fun.

1276
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,520
The whole fam is coming out.

1277
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,440
Sydney is gonna be doing a class.

1278
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,080
Is that right?

1279
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,120
Yeah, she's doing a class that should be really neat.

1280
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,520
Medically related.

1281
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,920
Cool.

1282
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,480
That'll be neat.

1283
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,640
And I'll just be walking around looking for ghosts.

1284
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah, it'll be a ton of fun.

1285
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,000
That one takes place in the Adirondacks.

1286
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,760
Poconos.

1287
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,560
The Poconos?

1288
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,760
Yep.

1289
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,160
Have I been saying the Adirondacks this whole time?

1290
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,600
I don't know what either one of them are.

1291
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,480
So, but I do know it is the Adirondacks in New York.

1292
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,880
This one takes place on the peak of the Matterhorn.

1293
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,880
It's gonna be a really fun time.

1294
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,320
Yeah, go to maxfuncon.com.

1295
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,920
You can find out how to get tickets there.

1296
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,640
We've all got PO boxes, but I wanted to bring it up

1297
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,600
because I am moving at the end of August.

1298
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,240
So from this point forward, don't send stuff to the LA box

1299
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,360
because I will not be able to get it after August.

1300
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,280
I'm moving back to Cincinnati to be closer to my family and such

1301
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,440
for when our spawn arrives.

1302
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,000
So yeah, I'll switch back to a Cincinnati PO box

1303
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,120
so we can keep that going.

1304
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,480
But if you've sent something now, I'll still get it.

1305
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,880
I'll be here for another like six weeks.

1306
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,200
But in the meantime, go ahead and send it to PO box 5400 West Virginia,

1307
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,080
2106, 25706.

1308
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,440
Or PO box 66639 Austin, Texas, 78766.

1309
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,320
Either one will get you there.

1310
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,120
Don't even worry about it.

1311
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,840
Don't even worry about it.

1312
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,600
Well, that one's for Griffin and this one's for me.

1313
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,080
I have, but anyway, those are PO boxes.

1314
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,440
Go to maximumfun.org and you can find all the great shows

1315
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,200
that are on our podcast network.

1316
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,280
Talking about shows like Adam Ruins Everything

1317
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
and One Bad Mother and Jordan Jesse Goh

1318
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,240
and Judge John Hodgman and stop podcasting yourself.

1319
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,600
They're all so, so great.

1320
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,720
We have a bunch of other shows.

1321
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,600
Some of them are on the network.

1322
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,320
Some of them aren't.

1323
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,960
You can find all the shows we do at mackleroyshows.com.

1324
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,640
That includes the video projects that we do

1325
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,200
like Monster Factory, which Justin and I do for Polygon.

1326
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,720
You can also find all that PO box info.

1327
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,360
Travis, have you added my PO box to that website yet?

1328
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:36,560
No, not yet.

1329
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,480
Boy, that would be good to have up on that web address.

1330
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,760
Just a bad brother.

1331
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,960
Yeah, you can find out all the stuff we do on mackleroyshows.com.

1332
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
We do a ton of shows, so you can find them all there.

1333
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,880
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1334
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1335
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1336
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Thank you very much, John and Long Winters.

1337
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,680
That's going to do it for us, folks.

1338
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,600
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1339
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,400
Griffin, do you have one more?

1340
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,480
Actually, can I say one thing before I forget?

1341
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,480
I just got to go up to San Diego Comic Con

1342
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,320
and I wanted to say thank you to Hank Green, Paul and Storm,

1343
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,520
Patrick Rothfuss, Adam Savage, all the people at Woodstock,

1344
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,120
and everybody that I met walking around the convention floor.

1345
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,400
I got recognized a couple of times

1346
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,080
and it made me feel really special

1347
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,360
and I really appreciated it.

1348
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,160
And everybody was just super nice and I had a great time.

1349
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,440
So yeah, I just want to say thank you to everybody

1350
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,720
while I was thinking about it.

1351
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,240
Thank you, Sandy D.

1352
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,480
And also thank you to Tybee Diskin,

1353
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,480
my best friend who I went with

1354
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,920
and I wouldn't have been able to go without her.

1355
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
So like, yeah, it was great.

1356
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,240
Okay, final Yahoo.

1357
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,840
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers,

1358
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,160
or this one was sent in by Connor Stuxlogger.

1359
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,440
By the way, the Verizon is apparently

1360
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,120
about to buy Yahoo for $5 billion.

1361
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,840
So like a lot of fucking, I hate to drop this energy

1362
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,800
right at the end of the show,

1363
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,880
but there's a lot of things up in the air right now.

1364
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
And just like, I could use your thoughts

1365
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
and your prayers and your concern,

1366
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,880
just like any energy you can sort of channel my way

1367
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,760
as I go through what may be a difficult transition

1368
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,360
based on what Verizon decides to do.

1369
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,600
I doubt that anybody would look at the Yahoo Answers product

1370
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,040
and say, yes, yes, that is the thing

1371
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,640
I want to invest money in to keep alive.

1372
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,680
So just like, yeah, thoughts and prayers, thank you.
