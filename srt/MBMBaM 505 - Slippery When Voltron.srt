1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother My Brother, an advice show from the modern era.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Uh, and it's been a big adjustment working from home.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,240
Yep.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
Uh, I miss everybody at the office.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,920
Oh yeah.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
Aw, sure dude, Stan Lee.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Did you say Dan Lee?

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
Stan Lee.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
Stan Lee, okay.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,080
Stan Lee.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,800
Stan Lee.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
Uh, fucking Dwight, dude.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,280
I d- wait, hold on. Is this isolation, or did we talk about the office last week?

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
I feel like we did that again last week.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,720
Pan, fucking gin, fucking-

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
Okay, wait, let me hit you with something.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Swites.

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
I want to hit you with a fantasy. This is a fantasy starter. Okay, everybody.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,040
Here's a prompt for your NaNoWriMo. Just get to going early, right?

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,360
Okay.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,760
Pam and Jim.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,320
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
That's something, right?

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,080
Yeah.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,320
But if you change both the sounds to in, you got pan and gin, and you're in like a fantasy thing.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,200
Just like that. It's a tale of one of the pantheon of gods and a genie recently freed from a lamp.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Oh, you went a different way. I thought you were saying like some kind of weird children's story

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,160
where like a frying pan and I guess a bottle of gin worked together and like ran away with

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
the spoon kind of thing.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
See, that's where I went with it too. And I, you know me, I live in Austin and I haven't been able

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,240
to get out to all of my favorite cocktail raceries, some of my favorite mixing labs that a lot of the

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,200
mixologists down here have been whipping up for me with their lavender smokes and scented orbs

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
and shit like that. And so I thought you were giving me the hot new cocktail of the spring

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,480
Justin, which is that you pour gin in a pan and make it, get it hot. And now we're talking about

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
hot gin?

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Hot gin, delicious.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,400
Hot, hot detoxified gin. That is some sterile gin right there.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
I burn all the alcohol out of that gin before I drink it. I just want the good flavor of that

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,680
gin with no-

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
I just want the flavor of hot gin.

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
I just want that to burn me.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,920
Hey guys, is this anything? Is this a cocktail? Gin and Sonic.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,120
Is that a cocktail?

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
So that could be something. By the way, is this intro anything so far? Because we've

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
tried about six different things in four minutes.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah, we'll get there. What do you guys think? I think gin and Sonic is a

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
gin and like blue curacao.

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Or you just watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie now on demand.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,800
Featuring-

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,040
Now this is interesting. Okay, Griffin, let's talk about this fucking heel turn.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Because this is a behind the scenes heel turn for everybody. We told Griffin we should do a

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Sonic watch about the release of Sonic. He quickly poo-pooed it. And now Griffin has taken us down

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,240
some back roads and removed the blindfolds to find that we are at Sonic's house.

61
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,600
And he has driven us there.

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,440
Here's the thing, Juice. You offered me- I was falling. Falling down the big tree. I fell off

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,960
the branches of the big tree where I was having a monkey party up top, right?

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,360
Yeah.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,920
And I fell down trying to reach a big coconut and I was falling. And then you two apes were like,

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,960
hey Griffin, here's a vine and it's Sonic the Hedgehog now on video on demand. Watch it,

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
catch it live.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
Yes, but boys, to follow-

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
Please let me finish.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,880
Just let him play. Please let him finish.

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,880
I saw that. I said, there's so many reasons not to grab that vine. I already did watch it. It's

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,880
an old movie. There's no way to make jokes about it anymore. People have done all the jokes. And

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
also there's a movie coming out next week on demand that I really want people to see so I

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
don't want them to burn their movie budget. But then I said poo-poo to that vine and I kept falling.

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,880
And then some more rotten ass vines came along. Rotten ass vines. Like here's how to make a hot

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
gin and here's the office, but fantasy. And now I'm looking up that Sonic vine. I'm like,

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,600
oh, that looks pretty fucked. It looks like that one can have a lot of tension on it,

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
that it will hold up my weight and keep me alive.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,240
But here's the problem Griffin, to continue Justin's metaphor, not only did you drive us

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
to Sonic's house, but it was like I said, Sonic's having a birthday party, let's go.

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,640
And you said, I don't want to go to Sonic's birthday party. And I said, okay. So I didn't

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,880
buy him a present. And then I get out of the car and you're like, we're at Sonic's birthday party

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
and I brought a present. And now Justin and I look like fucking assholes because we didn't bring any

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,160
presents for Sonic and you brought the present. Yeah, but now it's like we've all walked into

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
the party and you two are yelling about how you didn't get presents for Sonic, isn't it?

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, can we say that your present is from all of us?

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
Yeah, sure. Why not? Hey, Sonic. Hey guys, it's me,

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,080
Sonic. I'm so stoked you could make it to my bash. Hey, Sonic. It's good to be out.

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm glad that we broke the quarantine protocols for this Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday party.

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
Definitely worth it. Definitely worth it. A big find coming our way. But we did get you

91
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,360
all three of us this present together and we got it. Couldn't go to a store, obviously,

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
Sonic. So I apologize for that. It was made at home with a lot of love.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
I got a text from- Wait, are you still Sonic?

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
No, no, I'm Justin. I'm telling an anti there to entertain Sonic.

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,400
Hold on one second, Sonic. No problem. So-

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
I'll just be over here talking to my other guests. I'm a good host.

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Yeah, make the rounds, bud. I will, but just know that none of them are

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
as important to me as you are. Thanks, man. That's a good choice.

99
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,640
I mean, Mario's here, but fuck that guy, right? You guys are my true BFF.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,240
By the way, this is the best intro you guys have ever done because you're speeding through

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
the topic so fast without even paying attention to them or trying to flesh them out. Just like

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
I run through the city as Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm so proud of you.

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm proud of you because you're not focusing on any one thing for more than 25 seconds.

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,480
It was almost like we were in the middle of a bit in a skit right there,

105
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,120
and Justin just like fucking saw a butterfly float by and lost interest in it.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
That's cool. As a reward for your good comedy,

107
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm going to run around and scoop up all the coronavirus to protect you.

108
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
You didn't want to come to Sonic's house in the first place, Kermit.

109
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
If I run around the world real fast, it'll create a vortex. It's going to suck up all

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,640
the coronavirus. I've had the ability to do it this whole time.

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,560
But I held it back because you guys weren't doing a good enough intro yet.

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,320
But look at you now. My charming stars. I'm so proud of you.

113
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,880
Watch as I zoom around and cure the world.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
Kermit, you came here under duress. Come on, Tails. Let's save the McElroy brothers.

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
That is not Sonic music. Justin, what was your-

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
Tell us about your fucking text. I got text.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
No, I don't even want to do it anymore. No, you have to do it now.

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Not at all. Sonic's waiting.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't. I don't have to do it. You just butchered Sonic the Hedgehog

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
on the altar of your supposed joke, and you've slit his throat,

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
and the blood has run down into the trough, and then Sonic died,

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,640
and you look down and you're like, I don't really want to do the sacrifice.

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,040
I don't really want to do the Sonic sacrifice anymore.

124
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,760
But he's going to come back, right? No.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Read your fucking text, and we'll see if it's good enough.

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
I don't want to talk about it anymore. Justin?

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
No, things got funny. They weren't funny when I was going to do it.

128
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
Now it's less funny than what we're doing.

129
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
We had a fucking great Sonic the Hedgehog bit.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Like, it got better, but it was good bones.

131
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,920
You didn't want to come to Sonic's house.

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,640
But once we got there, Justin, we were there.

133
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,560
Why are you on his side? Why are you on his side?

134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm not. Listen, I'm on nobody's side.

135
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,160
Sonic the Hedgehog's house, okay? We haven't left our own houses in a while.

136
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
We're excited to be out and about fucking chilling with our blue friend.

137
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm just saying we could have talked about this in Sonic's bedroom.

138
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,320
We could have had a little privacy.

139
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,280
He's just standing there listening to all this, this toe tapping.

140
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
Tell me what your text said, or else I'm gonna have Knuckles whip your ass.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,760
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

142
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't want to talk about it.

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,040
Justin, here comes Knuckles. He looks angry.

144
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,280
I'll wait till things get less funny.

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,160
And then Knuckles is kind of cracking his, what's the word for it?

146
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,840
Uh, his like, fist bones?

147
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
The middle of his hand bones.

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,800
You know, his hand bendies? You know, he's popping them.

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,480
Not the meat in his hands, but the other stuff.

150
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,880
It's where it kind of like hand corners, you know? Hand hinges.

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Why does Tails have to take orders from Sonic? He can fly.

152
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
Justin, please read-

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,880
If I could fly away from Sonic, I would be the boss.

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
I would fly straight into his arms.

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
Yeah, they're in love.

156
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Hold on, let me look on the internet, see if there's a picture of that.

157
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
Huh. Oh no, my computer is melting.

158
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,080
Hey, what's a question or the text? I will accept either one.

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,320
I don't want to talk.

160
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Read the text, Justin.

161
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,880
Okay, I got a text from some random staffer

162
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,680
who was fundraising for some candidate in Iowa, like yesterday.

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
And I got this text, and I'm not in Iowa,

164
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
so I don't like people straight up just texting me out of nowhere.

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
So they're like, hey, this is me from this campaign.

166
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
How you doing today?

167
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
And I said, you know, I'm just getting my house cleaned up

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
for a big party before all my guests get here.

169
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,520
And then the person responded, yeah, I feel you.

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,160
No, I don't know what the proper response should have been.

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Probably like, give me your address, I'm calling the cops on you.

172
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,040
Right.

173
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
But I did not expect, yeah, I feel you.

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh, jeez, Sonic's looking up from the blood-soaked glyphs, and he's smiling.

175
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
Oh, he liked it.

176
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,920
He's so glad you killed him.

177
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,280
Thank you for killing me, Justin.

178
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
Set me free!

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
To die is the true invention.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,960
Gotta go fast into Christ's ever-loving arms.

181
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
Up here, everything's fast.

182
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Jeez, O'Pete.

183
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
That's his real name.

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Gotta find the questions.

185
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
As I work as an editor for, now, okay, can I clarify, Travis?

186
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,160
Yes.

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
What times?

188
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
These are for the current days.

189
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,440
What epoch?

190
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,200
These are, I went out and scooped these up from the blasted wastelands myself.

191
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
These are today times, yes.

192
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,060
Yes.

193
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,280
Work as an editor for a publishing company.

194
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,680
The workflow around here is not very steady.

195
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Some days I have lots of pages to check, and other days I have absolutely nothing to do.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
This was never a problem in the office, as I'd gotten pretty good pretending to be busy

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
when my boss walked by.

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,960
However, now that we're all quarantined and working from home, I have to send a detailed

199
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,680
report to my boss every day listing the specific projects I worked on.

200
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Brothers, how can I beef up my report so it looks like I'm busy every day when I'm actually

201
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
doing fuck all?

202
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
That's for misleading in Massachusetts.

203
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,640
It is weird to me that we live in a time, and listen, I believe you, question asker,

204
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,160
but it is weird to me that we live in a time where it was easier to pretend to do nothing

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,280
at the office surrounded by other people than in your own home watched by probably only

206
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,000
your Alexa.

207
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:52,240
Well, it's because there are a lot of folks out there in managerial positions of a lot

208
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,600
of different places that assume that as soon as you leave their line of sight, you are

209
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
playing Pokemon Go with all of your friends at the park.

210
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,520
And that's obviously not true, and is a very shitty way to think about your employees.

211
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,320
On the flip side of that, I did dick around pretty much my entire first couple of years

212
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,520
of working from home.

213
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,160
So like, like, yeah, I'm playing Pokemon Go at the park with my friends, but hey, we're

214
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
all going through some shit right now.

215
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,400
Yeah, maybe calm down a little bit.

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,200
I think that this this question asker is not the only person dealing with this.

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,920
Yes, my evidence is your guy has gotten a lot of how can I put this in a non incriminating

218
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
fashion?

219
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Your guy has gotten a lot of requests for conference calls in the past couple of weeks

220
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,680
with some of our many friends and partners that maybe your boy didn't necessarily need

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,360
to be on a conference call with.

222
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,400
And he has a suspicion that maybe some of our beloved friends and partners are trying

223
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,200
to get a few more few more pips on the old workflow sheet for that and trying to log

224
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,320
a couple of.

225
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,240
Yeah, I did some some brand extension with our man Justin over there, logged a big long

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,800
call with him.

227
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,720
What if you just started listing on your list of stuff that you did just like a half hour

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
where you just went dark when your boss is like, what?

229
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,720
What's that all about?

230
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,640
You say, I wish I could tell you.

231
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,520
That's yeah, 10 a.m. to three p.m.

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,560
Michael's private time.

233
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,400
And then it'll be like, what did you do in there?

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,960
And be like, can you fucking read?

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
You don't get to ask me that.

236
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
It's Michael's private time.

237
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,600
What about just like you just write like ten to three synergistic planning session?

238
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
That's pretty good.

239
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Right.

240
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
And I'll be like, what was that?

241
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,160
I was like, I was trying to plan how to do some more synergy.

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,960
If you don't know, you're the sorry.

243
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,840
You're the boss.

244
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
Yeah, that's weird.

245
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,680
Ten to three.

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,960
Watch reruns of who's the boss because I was having a hard time remembering who the boss

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,120
was on the flip side.

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,800
You can also keep an incredibly detailed log of just like eight.

249
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,920
Eight oh one.

250
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,800
Woke up.

251
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
Eight eleven.

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
Finished my morning bathroom time.

253
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
Eight twelve.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Started cooking oatmeal.

255
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,600
It was a Tuesday, Derek.

256
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
And then eleven fifty one to eleven fifty four.

257
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,280
Please don't ask me what I did during these three minutes.

258
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,160
Please.

259
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
Eight forty five to nine.

260
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
Made made oatmeal.

261
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,320
Nine oh one realized burned oatmeal.

262
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
Nine oh two started making oatmeal again.

263
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
Oh no, out of oatmeal.

264
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,960
What do I do?

265
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,840
Nine oh five to nine oh seven again.

266
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
I need a secret.

267
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
Please.

268
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
Please let it be a secret.

269
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,760
Nine oh seven to nine oh nine again.

270
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Might have just been a continuation of first secret.

271
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Hard to tell.

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,800
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

273
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,520
Yeah, I'd love that.

274
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,720
Here's one that was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

275
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,280
Thank you, Graham.

276
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,080
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Limba asks.

277
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,160
When you go to someone's place, what can you learn from their bathroom?

278
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,760
Everything.

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,040
Wow.

280
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,360
I think everything's maybe exaggeration, but I think you can learn a great deal.

281
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
And I also think as adults, this is the closest we get to when you're a kid and you stay the

282
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,720
night at somebody's house for the first time and in your friendship with them and you like it

283
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,520
fucking parts the veil just like, oh, so that's how you do all this shit.

284
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
That's how you do all this stuff.

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
We've talked about this many times, but it's like Poirot, right?

286
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,680
Where it's all about the psychology, right?

287
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
That's what I'm saying is walking into someone's bathroom and seeing,

288
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,560
like putting yourself in their head where it's like, oh, you had to get that close.

289
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,760
Like you put this there so you could reach it from here.

290
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,400
Now I know what type of person you are, right?

291
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Like if you come into my restroom, I don't want to brag, but I have two extra rolls of

292
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,080
toilet paper in there because you are bragging.

293
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
That's so it's used.

294
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,840
That started as a joke, but it is an actual brag.

295
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,480
It's a little bit.

296
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah.

297
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
And maybe a little bit incriminating there.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,400
Hoarders.

299
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Well, I have only the two.

300
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,740
Sorry.

301
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
He's hoarding.

302
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,920
He doesn't need that.

303
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
Justin, I have only two rolls.

304
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,080
I've lived with Travis a great many years of my life.

305
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,920
And let me just say that is not a lot for Travis.

306
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,480
That's a Wednesday morning through a Friday afternoon.

307
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, I get silly in there, you know, and get this, Justin.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,240
It's one ply, which I'm horrified to admit because that's basically nothing.

309
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,520
I've been trying to look for toilet paper online to see if it's a bit,

310
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
because you still can't buy it in stores.

311
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Did y'all hear about this?

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Oh, hey, stand back.

313
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,880
He's about to like, there's a delivery here.

314
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm waiting for it.

315
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:13,920
Go on.

316
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Because I feel like once it's online, it's available.

317
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
You can still find the only toilet paper you can buy.

318
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,320
And I'm so tempted.

319
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,600
You can get like a giant, like one of the commercial,

320
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,760
like three foot wide rolls, single ply rolls that from like,

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,560
that you'd see at like a fucking convention center or something.

322
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,000
And I feel like if I found that in someone's bathroom,

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,560
that would actually tell me a whole lot about them.

324
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,760
Mostly good.

325
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
Yeah, good stuff.

326
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
Good stuff, mostly good stuff about preparation and economy

327
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
and just like general ass sensitivity.

328
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
But I have been tempted to buy the giant roll

329
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,240
and just not worry about it anymore.

330
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,920
Then I don't have to worry about it ever again.

331
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,040
I'll just have the giant roll.

332
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
What if you walked into someone's bathroom,

333
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
they had one of those three foot wide rolls,

334
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
but it was like hanging on a chain that was bolted to the wall.

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
What does that tell you?

336
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,440
And you have to like get a key on like a big ladle

337
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
to go in there and use the bathroom.

338
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
What's that tell you about them?

339
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,800
That you're at a gas station and not a house.

340
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,160
Yeah, but like somebody lives there.

341
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
You know what I mean?

342
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,360
And they have like ding dongs in the bathroom.

343
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah.

344
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, I guess the gas station man lives there.

345
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
Is that what you're saying?

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
Yeah, but that's his bathroom.

347
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
It's the only bathroom he has.

348
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,560
I'm trying to think of the last time I walked into a friend's bathroom

349
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,200
and was like kind of shocked by what I saw in there.

350
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,560
It's never I walk into somebody's bathroom

351
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,520
and there's active shits in places where they shouldn't be.

352
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,000
It's more like I walk into their bathroom

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,920
and it is like very perfumed and potpourri

354
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,280
and like very powdered and prim and proper

355
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
in a way that you don't always anticipate.

356
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,480
You walk in and it's like a mid 90s sort of like grandmother's bathroom.

357
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
And that's like dope.

358
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,000
That's great.

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
That's your scent.

360
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,600
And that's the profile that you chased down.

361
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,520
It's just like I was not expecting that necessarily.

362
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
For me, it's if I walk in there

363
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
and there's some kind of poster on the wall that I wasn't expecting

364
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,120
where it's like, oh, Jeff Goldblum is going to watch me doody.

365
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,360
Okay.

366
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,320
You ever seen that, Trav?

367
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,200
A Jeff Goldblum poster in someone's bathroom?

368
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,700
Yeah.

369
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,200
Okay.

370
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,140
I won't blow the shot, but-

371
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,780
I think shower curtain design,

372
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,100
like then you know who your fun friend is.

373
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,060
Oh man.

374
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,140
I went in there and that looked like fish on your shower curtain.

375
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,060
That's fucking hilarious, Jeremy.

376
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,100
I went in there and it kind of looked like the shower from Psycho.

377
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,860
Like there was like a shadow on it, right?

378
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,660
So if you're inside of it, it's like someone's going to kill you.

379
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,060
That's funny and scary.

380
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,660
That's funny and scary.

381
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,100
That tickles both parts of my brain.

382
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,900
I love that, Jeremy.

383
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,340
It's just like critters in space.

384
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,180
Funny and scary.

386
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,420
I think it's weird to see unused bath bombs

387
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,860
because what are you waiting for?

388
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,140
Times are tough.

389
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,460
Treat yourself.

390
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,940
I think the reason all of the three of us have bidets

391
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,380
is so you can walk into our bathroom

392
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,540
and just sort of immediately clock what we're about

393
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,380
without having to look anywhere else.

394
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,660
You see the bidet on the toilet.

395
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,940
We could have a poster hanging on the wall that says like,

396
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,740
I like to murder and you would see the bidet and be like,

397
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,660
I've seen all eight, case closed.

398
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,220
I get it.

399
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,980
I get their whole thing.

400
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,620
It's an autobiography on top of my toilet.

401
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,300
Here's another question.

402
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,540
I have a goldfish named Gibby.

403
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,460
Can I just say, I really like this one

404
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,140
because I think more than all the questions

405
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,580
about being quarantined,

406
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,660
this one might best exemplify kind of

407
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,260
what everyone's going through right now.

408
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,980
So go ahead.

409
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,380
I have a goldfish named Gibby that I keep in my room.

410
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,220
Gibby is about to be three

411
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
and for the past month and a half,

412
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,260
he's been picking up pebbles in his tank,

413
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,820
trying to eat them and then spinning them out very loudly.

414
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,180
He does this in the middle of the night,

415
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,460
usually at 2 a.m.

416
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,700
How do I stop him or punish him without killing him?

417
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,100
Okay.

418
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,180
I still love my fishy boy.

419
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,900
That's from Nautical Naughty in North Brunswick.

420
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,580
What I love about this is this is the kind of thing

421
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,780
where like maybe a month ago, your fish doing this,

422
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,820
you wouldn't even clock it.

423
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,540
You wouldn't even know.

424
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,220
No, no, no, no, not even notice.

425
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,940
Yeah, but now you're like, fuck Gibby.

426
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
If you spit out one more goddamn pebble.

427
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,060
My life with Gibby has gotten challenging.

428
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,020
Day 14, things are tense between me and Gibby.

429
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,980
I've had to start leaving on

430
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,540
eight hour long YouTube videos of birds for my cat

431
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,100
because my cat just can't chill.

432
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,780
Just has zero chill.

433
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,060
So while I'm kind of doing my thing downstairs,

434
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,740
with the comedy and what have you,

435
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,620
the jokes and things,

436
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,100
the cat is watching bird vids

437
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,220
just to kind of keep her a little bit chilled out.

438
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,660
I gave Lily, my bigger doggy,

439
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,980
you know, a squeaker chew toy thing that I've been saving

440
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,660
because she was getting very antsy.

441
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,340
And so I gave it to her and the pitch and frequency of it

442
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,180
has become like an annoying like telltale heart.

443
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,700
But like if it's out of a heartbeat,

444
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,140
it was just a squeaker

445
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,980
and it pierced through my brain every time,

446
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,900
every 0.5 seconds.

447
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,300
My little stinker is always up to no good.

448
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,980
This fuzzy fucking rascal

449
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,300
is always doing bad stuff in my house,

450
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,540
but you gotta love them, huh?

451
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,460
You gotta love your son.

452
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,140
No man, I'm talking about my little,

453
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,020
my puppers with his toe beans.

454
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,420
This little stinker guys,

455
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,260
you don't remember my puppers?

456
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,460
It's just now occurred to me,

457
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,540
my cat's always in quarantine.

458
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,740
So the only thing that she could be negatively reacting to

459
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,500
is our increased presence.

460
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,380
Yes, right.

461
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,980
That is what has irritated the cat.

462
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,620
That's kind of her time to chill out.

463
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,820
Maybe that's what Gibby's doing

464
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,700
is Gibby is trying to annoy you out of the room.

465
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,020
Yeah, please.

466
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,220
This is Gibby's time.

467
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,180
Please go.

468
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,740
But at the same time, it's like who rescued who?

469
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,460
You know what?

470
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,180
Thank you.

471
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,540
Because I always think that

472
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
when I look at my puppers' toe beans.

473
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,780
Can I make a suggestion?

474
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,500
Here's what you do,

475
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,900
a nautical naughty in North Brunswick,

476
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
get a bowl, get an identical fish bowl

477
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,020
and put, I don't know, like some clear edible,

478
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,940
so that maybe like Cairo syrup,

479
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
something clear and edible,

480
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,540
and then put one goldfish cracker in it.

481
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,300
Put it next to Gibby's bowl

482
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,620
and then yell at the fake goldfish cracker,

483
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,380
like you've been annoying the hell out of me

484
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,940
and then eat that goldfish cracker in front of Gibby.

485
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:40,740
Cool.

486
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,820
And then kind of slowly turn to Gibby and say,

487
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,380
you're next if you keep it up with that pebble thing.

488
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,820
That's a cool idea.

489
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,420
Yeah, it's a cool idea.

490
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,700
No, it's definitely not like really troubling

491
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
and it'll work.

492
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,900
The fish will get it for sure, for sure, for sure.

493
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,020
Well, okay Griffin.

494
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,460
Okay, smart guy.

495
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,100
Give me a punishment that one could enact on a fish

496
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,540
that would not kill it, period.

497
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,980
Okay, put it further away from you.

498
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,780
That's not a punishment, that's what the fish wants.

499
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,900
Then good, both parties win

500
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,540
and you can be in the corner and do...

501
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
First, fish can't make loud noises.

502
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,100
There's no fish, unless it is a whale

503
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,180
and it slaps its big body against the water

504
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,140
after diving out of it.

505
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,660
Fish cannot make loud noises.

506
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,620
So this is a full-blown fever dream

507
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,780
that you've got going on and that's fine.

508
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,860
We've all got them, it's tough times out here.

509
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,900
But if you're having trouble

510
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,700
with your completely stationary aquatic pet,

511
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,300
put it in the corner or outside.

512
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,740
There's so many places for this fish to go.

513
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,540
Don't put it outside.

514
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,740
Don't put it outside.

515
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,780
Don't put it outside.

516
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,900
Don't put it outside.

517
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
I mean, there's a temptation to say,

518
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,060
like, just feed him less.

519
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,860
But you know Gibby, he's just getting up fucking shredded

520
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,060
and looking great and shredding those last few ounces

521
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,620
that he needed to get to his sexiest fish bod.

522
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,420
I'm just worried.

523
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,820
I'm worried about rewarding his negative behavior

524
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,500
because now he wants to be moved.

525
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,380
You move him because he's been behaving badly.

526
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
And then what's next?

527
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,980
He wants a tiny TV and then he starts yelling at you,

528
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,060
ping, ping, ping, spitting those pebbles against the bowl.

529
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,740
And then you're like, fine, you'll get a tiny TV.

530
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,540
And then what's next?

531
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,580
His own house?

532
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,860
A water slide?

533
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,020
I think this is where you got to draw the line.

534
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
You need to establish dominance.

535
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,380
You need to get in that bowl.

536
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,820
You need to swim better than him.

537
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
You need to spit pebbles better than him.

538
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,540
Establish fish dominance.

539
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,020
Travis?

540
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,620
You could get in his head maybe

541
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
and watch the shape of water near him

542
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,700
and then just every few minutes be like, I get it.

543
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,980
I get it.

544
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,940
Absolutely.

545
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,580
I get it.

546
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:36,900
Yes.

547
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,900
Now, is that to scare him

548
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,460
into thinking that you might be romantically attracted to him?

549
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,100
I mean, you just keep guessing.

550
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,620
You're not willing to commit to the bit

551
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,900
you just crafted, Justin.

552
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,940
I don't know.

553
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,980
Your own thing made you uncomfortable, didn't it?

554
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,340
While you were in the middle of it,

555
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,580
I could tell you were like, oof, this sucks.

556
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,380
Middle of it.

557
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,060
In the middle of it, I didn't like it.

558
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,380
Travis.

559
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,340
I don't like it.

560
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,140
I like it less now, but in the middle of it, I started.

561
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,660
At the beginning, let me chart.

562
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,060
Yeah.

563
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,980
At the beginning, I liked it.

564
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,380
Yeah.

565
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,780
I felt very good about getting in there with it.

566
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,380
Middle of the road, sort of halfway through the project,

567
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,220
took a little intermission in my medulla oblongata

568
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,380
and started to rethink the whole enterprise.

569
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,700
By the end of it, I wish I'd punched out earlier,

570
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,540
but I felt like I was pot committed and I hate it.

571
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Can I ask you a quick post-game question?

572
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,660
Yeah, anything, Travis.

573
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,180
I'd love to follow up on this

574
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,420
so that others can learn from my failings.

575
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,020
Now, if you could go back and do it again,

576
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,020
would you change the movie or change your delivery or?

577
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,020
Okay, so I did think about A Fish Called Wanda

578
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,660
and I thought maybe something there with Kevin Kline

579
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,700
eating the fish, if you remember, right?

580
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,540
And then I thought something about the fish man

581
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,700
and then from Shape of Water

582
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,220
and then just the opening was there.

583
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,540
I just started going.

584
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,700
I didn't have a goal line in mind.

585
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
I just started going for it.

586
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,580
I wish Justin you had brought up

587
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,380
the incredible Mr. Limpet so I could have crossed off

588
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,820
the fucking wild obscure references

589
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,540
my bim bam bingo card that I have printed out here.

590
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,180
I would love, you know, I thought of something different.

591
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,380
Let's go to the money zone.

592
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,100
We don't need to talk about my thing anymore, for sure.

593
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,900
Sure, Justin sounds good.

594
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:36,500
Justin Thank you, Philip.

595
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Hey, listen, did you just eat a fish

596
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,620
and you want to get the taste of your goldfish out of your mouth?

597
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,460
Good news, you've got Quip.

598
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Quip, it says here is the makers of the Quip electric toothbrush

599
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,700
that is the best at scrubbing goldfish

600
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
from betwixt your chompers.

601
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
Huh, that's weird.

602
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,660
It's weird how well that works out.

603
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,100
Oh, get David Blaine over your house.

604
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,740
He knows how to do it, but then cancel it out.

605
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,180
David Blaine knows how to swallow the fish,

606
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,980
but then get it out.

607
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,260
It's two different fish.

608
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,700
He does get a real fish every time.

609
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,140
It's two fish.

610
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,740
They're twins.

611
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
It's twin fish.

612
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,380
Okay, so it's basically the prestige.

613
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,940
Well, it's not exactly the prestige.

614
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,540
It is, okay, it is the prestige.

615
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,220
David Blaine is a big fan of the prestige.

616
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,980
So you've been brushing your teeth

617
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,180
and you're like, how long has that been?

618
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,860
Cause it still tastes like goldfish.

619
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,900
Well, they have a built-in two minute timer

620
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
in the Quip electric toothbrush

621
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,100
so that you won't have to worry about

622
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,980
if you've brushed long enough

623
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,660
to get the goldfish out from between your teeth.

624
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,020
And if there's some stuck in there,

625
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,340
they also provide floss, which is great

626
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,500
because that will get that hard to reach goldfish

627
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,020
out from between your teeth.

628
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,140
And they deliver toothpaste, brush heads

629
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,020
and floss refills every three months

630
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,140
because your old ones are going to be caked in goldfish bits

631
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,220
and you can get it with free shipping.

632
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,460
So go to getquip.com slash my brother right now

633
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,300

637
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,460
Hey, it's tough to go pretty much anywhere right now.

638
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,820
And that includes the post office

639
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,740
which is an extant space in the world.

640
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,660
But hey, you need to send out letters and packages.

641
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,620
You need your postage.

642
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,100
Don't worry, stamps.com is here to help

643
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,220
from the safety and privacy of your own fricking house.

644

645
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,140
you can do from home at stamps.com.

646
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,460
You just use your computer to print official US postage

647
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,860
24 seven for any letter, any package, any class of mail,

648
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,220
anywhere you want to send it.

649
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,180
And then once your mail's ready

650
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,780
you just leave it out for your character,

651
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,500
for your character, for your original character.

652
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,220
Say you've got a new member of the Sonicverse

653
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,940
and their name is Turbo and they're a Velociraptor

654
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,940
and they've got a bad attitude.

655
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,300
They'll pick up your fricking mail

656
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,540
and deliver it wherever you need it delivered.

657
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,020
And you can schedule a free package pickup.

658
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,460
You can drop it in a mailbox.

659
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,140
No human contact required.

660
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,740
It's that simple.

661
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,580
You can get great discounts too.

662
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,900

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,180

and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,060
at the top of the homepage and type in my brother.

670
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,980
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

671
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,020
Stay safe, my friends.

672
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,580
They do have that in the copy at the end of the thing.

673
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,900
And you have to read it.

674
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,700
You have to read it.

675
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,900
And it is, okay, we'll say this.

676
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,420
As performers and ad copy readers,

677
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,700
it is mandatory that we do say stay safe, my friends.

678
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,180
But it does, for a mandatory message,

679
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,820
it does make me feel a certain amount of warmth and care.

680
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
A mandatory amount.

681
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
A mandatory amount of essential-

682
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,700
Wait, is it possible stamps.com is saying that

683
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,820
just to the three of us?

684
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,060
Oh, it is maybe,

685
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,500
but I didn't know stamps.com thought of us that way.

686
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,740
I thought of us as business liaisons,

687
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,860
but I guess I do love,

688
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
I guess I am in love with stamps.com.

689
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,180
Every Christmas they do send me four brownies.

690
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,420
Yeah.

691
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,940
So what's that all about?

692
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,440
Stop.

693
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,980
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

694
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,820
With me in studio to take your calls

695
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,380

696
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,940
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

697
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,140
Go ahead, caller.

698
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,460
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

699
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,220
that's insightful and thoughtful,

700
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,300
but also helps me discover artists

701
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,820
and albums that I've never heard of.

702
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,060
Yeah, man, sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

703
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,140
Every week, myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes,

704
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
and my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

705
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,260
talk to influential guests about a canonical album

706
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,340
that has changed their lives.

707
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,660
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

708
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,500
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell, and so much more.

709
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Yo, what's that show called again?

710
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

711
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

712
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay.

713
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,980
Is that bad?

714
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,060
No.

715
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,100
You sounded disappointed.

716
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,020
No, I just, it's, sometimes it's...

717
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,300
I want a munch.

718
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,800
What?

719
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I want too much.

720
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,740
Now it's bad.

721
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,620
That was a punk one.

722
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,580
Whew.

723
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,620
It's like grimy punk.

724
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,900
That was really punky.

725
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,460
Yeah, dude.

726
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,660
Yeah, it's really punky.

727
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,100
Snack flag.

728
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,980
Why did I take it back to,

729
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,540
I took it back to more retro,

730
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
because I have an exciting new development.

731
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,260
And this, I have to give the credit.

732
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,180
This was not necessarily my idea,

733
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,340
but I think it is genius.

734
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,540
This came in from Quinn,

735
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,580
and Quinn suggested a throwback munch squad

736
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,660
that we go back way back to before,

737
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,220
and not just like to a few years back,

738
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,420
ones we might've missed.

739
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,780
We dig deep.

740
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,260
Oh.

741
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,660
Right?

742
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,740
I mean, so I'm putting out the call

743
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,900
if you can get some press releases

744
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,540
from like wild shit that came before.

745
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,060
The Library of Congress

746
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,300
to find like when McDonald's did pizza.

747
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,740
Yeah.

748
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,020
That's what I'm talking about.

749
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,700
Find me those press releases.

750
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,820
Dig way deep.

751
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,860
Let's get nasty.

752
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,820
In Big Big Pizza War,

753
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,740
will Bigfoot top the Dominator?

754
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,020
Oh my God, yes.

755
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,460
Oh yeah.

756
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,220
This is a, listen folks,

757
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,900
this is a news story published,

758
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,940
it's by Michael Dresser,

759
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
published in the Baltimore Sun

760
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,620
on April 30th, 1993.

761
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,120
Wow.

762
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,980
This is a, blow the dust off of it.

763
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,860
This munch squad.

764
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,220
Man, this is good.

765
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,060
I'm really, I've been really excited

766
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,580
the whole show to read this to y'all.

767
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,740
Is that why you killed Sonic?

768
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,740
Hasta la pizza, baby.

769
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,500
All right.

770
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,060
Good start.

771
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,540
All right.

772
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,300
Hasta la pizza, baby.

773
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,500
Here comes the Dominator.

774
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,820
Boasting that it has created

775
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,260
the biggest, baddest,

776
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,740
hunkahunkah melted cheese on the market.

777
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,860
Oh, fuck me.

778
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,300
Domino's Pizza Inc.

779
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,100
lurched into the Monster Pizza Wars yesterday

780
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,700
with a 30 inch, 30 slice pie

781
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,220
in the face of its competitors.

782
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,420
That's one, hold up.

783
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Each slice is one inch?

784
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,980
Fuck off.

785
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,340
This is what's challenging.

786
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,300
Brought to life in Domino's Laboratories

787
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,740
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

788
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,260
The Dominator will grapple

789
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
with Pizza Hut's Bigfoot

790
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,740
and Little Caesar's Big Big Pizza

791
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,340
for the biggest bite of the market

792
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,780
for carry out pizza

793
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,220
with a gland condition.

794
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,540
Okay.

795
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,580
Hilarious.

796
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,620
Reggie Fils-Aime.

797
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,100
Hilarious.

798
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,420
His biggest failure

799
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,580
in his time at the Pizza Hut

800
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
and perhaps his biggest professional failure

801
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,180
was the Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza.

802
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,580
And now Domino's is challenging Reggie's failure

803
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,900
with the Dominator.

804
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,060
Domino's Rectangular Dominator.

805
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,300
So that should make more sense, right?

806
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,260
It will measure a,

807
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,980
fuck it, 1993.

808
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,060
Measure a Schwarzeneggerian,

809
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,820
Schwarzeneggerian,

810
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
10 inches by 30 inches.

811
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,980
Okay, 10 inches by 30.

812
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,020
So that's 300.

813
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,900
Tim Mac, it's 300 square inches of pizza

814
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,740
in 30 slices, each slice is 10.

815
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,660
Okay, I was getting there.

816
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,220
Square inches.

817
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,660
I was gonna get there, Justin.

818
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,860
You have to let me do it on my own

819
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,700
if I'm ever gonna get better at it.

820
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Late side by side,

821
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,500
it's bigger than my three-year-old.

822
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,300
Who I have always wanted to eat.

823
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,260
Dad, let me up.

824
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,860
Said a Domino's spokesman, Tim McIntyre.

825
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:46,900
Later.

826
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
Bigger than my three-year-old.

827
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,980
Oh wait, hold on.

828
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,940
I'm reading right here.

829
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
It says, okay, yeah, uh-huh.

830
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,060
Okay, okay.

831
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,180
This 27, 30-year-old man just killed his dad.

832
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,700
Oh, and he said it's because he used to lay me next to pizza.

833
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,060
I lay my kid next to a pizza for a thing I wanted to say.

834
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,700
The Mine's Bigger Than Yours contest

835
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,860
got started in earnest last month

836
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,260
when Little Caesars began the national rollout

837
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,700
of its 11 and a quarter by 22 and a half inch

838
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,340
big, big pizza on the Ides of March.

839
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,460
That roused the wrath of Pizza the Hut,

840
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,420
which went Little Caesar a step bigger, bigger

841
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,460
by trumping out this fucking big ups to you, Michael Dresser,

842
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,140
for putting in the fucking work.

843
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,020
Yeah, dude.

844
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,340
Putting in the work.

845
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,540
You don't see this kind of attention to detail anymore

846
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,740
in these press releases.

847
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,900
The Ides of March thing is a goof on the fact

848
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,940
that it's Little Caesars.

849
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,180
Yes.

850
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,100
Fucking layers upon layers of melted cheese and sauce and bread.

851
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,540
Now here comes the Dominator.

852
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,780
Delighted, Travis.

853
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,140
Now here comes the Dominator,

854
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,340
scheduled to begin hitting the stores in various markets

855
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,980
whether Baltimore is one hasn't been decided

856
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,060
in about two weeks.

857
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,820
In a switch from Domino's traditional emphasis

858
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,340
on delivered pizza,

859
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,460
it will be available by carryout only.

860
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,500
That's right, folks.

861
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,900
You can't get this set to your house.

862
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,860
You have to go.

863
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,460
You have to come here to do this

864
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,980
because it's a crime otherwise.

865
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,980
We don't even know if our 1993 automobiles

866
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,380
could handle a pizza this large.

867
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,780
The market that we're going after,

868
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,020
the carryout value pizza market is a very hungry one,

869
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,700
said Mr. McIntyre.

870
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
Why not be the biggest?

871
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,340
Hey, Tim, you've said several wild things all together

872
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,020
with very few wild words.

873
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,620
You've said a very wild thing

874
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,140
and that is pizza hungry people love a hungry pizza.

875
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,860
Get it big.

876
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,620
So you're saying hungry people want a big pizza.

877
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,180
Yes.

878
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,540
What about two pizzas?

879
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,340
What?

880
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,900
What? You can do two pizzas and have both.

881
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,140
Somebody could bring them to you

882
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,340
and you wouldn't have to leave your house.

883
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,780
But big people with big hunger only have one mouth.

884
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,420
Nice try.

885
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,660
They drive a car.

886
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,780
Come get me pizza.

887
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,620
They love leaving house.

888
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,860
Hey guys, I'm not halfway through the story

889
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,100
and I'm not a third into the wildest shit in it.

890
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,340
Okay.

891
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,700
But what really accounts for this mega pizza trend?

892
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,020
Have the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles multiplied?

893
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,660
Oh my God.

894
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,500
Is President Clinton's White House staff

895
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,420
pulling too many all-nighters for ordinary pizzas?

896
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,060
Oh boy.

897
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,940
Fucking just keep it coming.

898
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,340
It's like, I know it was written in 93

899
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,220
but I feel like it was written to be read in 2020

900
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,860
to take you on a fucking, I love the 90s.

901
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,460
He finished it and sealed it up

902
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,260
and then just like buried it in Justin's front yard.

903
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,620
It's like, I feel like I'm watching like Good Night

904
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,060
and Good Gene Shallot.

905
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,020
It's fantastic.

906
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,580
This is the quote.

907
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,220
It would go a long way towards sating the hunger

908
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,980
of the healthcare task force,

909
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,620
said a spokesman in the White House press office

910
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,260
who asked to be identified only as assistant

911
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,980
to the president in charge of pizza control.

912
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,180
What in the living fuck?

913
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,140
The only problem he said is security.

914
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,660
It's dangerous, quote.

915
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,820
You could fit a lot of stuff on a pizza that big.

916
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,460
He said, fucking story.

917
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,380
Do you know that originally Prince titled the song pizza control?

918
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,900
And then they said, well, I don't think

919
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,740
that that's risque enough for Prince.

920
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,940
Make it yucky here, Prince.

921
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,860
And he said, okay, I think I can judge it up a little bit.

922
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,940
This White House staffer was reached out to

923
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,860
for a quote about the big pizzas

924
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,020
and made a fun joke about, oh, I don't know.

925
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,900
We love pizza around here.

926
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,500
And then realized like, wait a minute.

927
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,340
You could stick a lot of anthrax in a 30 square inch pizza.

928
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,860
And this was pre 9-11 when they didn't even check the pizzas.

929
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,500
A lot of things changed on 9-11.

930
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,860
You used to be able to just walk up and hand a pizza directly

931
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,900
to the president.

932
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,780
A lot of things also changed in the fall of 1993

933
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,700
when these big pizzas came around.

934
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,940
Oh God, where to next?

935
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,580
Oh, that's right.

936
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,080
Okay.

937
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,100
Fucking Michael Dresser, you genius.

938
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,540
But futurist Melinda Davis said,

939
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,500
this big pizza business has nothing to do with politics.

940
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,620
It's about sex.

941
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,180
What?

942
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,580
What?

943
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,080
Huh?

944
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,740
Consider the shape, she said.

945
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,380
Pizza was traditionally a very female thing.

946
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,940
It's very round and cheesy and warm.

947
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,820
Holy fuck.

948
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,340
And suddenly it's become pizza as a weapon, said Miss Davis.

949
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,820
What?

950
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,020
Creative director at Brain Reserve,

951
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,140
a New York based marketing firm

952
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
that specializes in consumer trends.

953
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,940
What the fuck?

954
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,100
Also someday everyone will have phones

955
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,860
that are also computers.

956
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,420
But are they saying a rectangle is like a dick is like a weapon?

957
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,300
Like a weapon, not like women who are round and warm cheese.

958
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,020
Yes.

959
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,260
That is a profound and hugely wrong statement, obviously.

960
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,420
But it's like, I don't even know if it's sexist or not

961
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,260
because it's so hard to unpack.

962
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Well, I think we can all agree

963
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,860
that people who identify as female

964
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,220
give off a certain warm, cheesy energy.

965
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,980
Cheesy vibe.

966
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,340
Whereas men who, people who identify as men

967
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,340
often give off this kind of rectangular kind of,

968
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,700
why is it, why are they so big?

969
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,180
I've got big rhombus energy over here.

970
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,220
Pizza was traditionally a very female thing.

971
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,180
It's very round and cheesy and warm.

972
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,620
And suddenly it's become pizza as a weapon, said Miss Davis.

973
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,580
But why?

974
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,620
Quote, because we're in the age of AIDS.

975
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,020
We have to look for sensual pleasure that isn't sexual.

976
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,940
She said, it's about anger.

977
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,700
It's about rage.

978
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,100
Consumers are really mad at all the rules

979
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,300
they have to follow in the 90s.

980
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,260
What is happening?

981
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,700
Sue Sherbo, a spokeswoman for Little Caesars in Detroit

982
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,980
seemed puzzled by that logic.

983
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,900
Our only concern was to offer our customer a great value.

984
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,860
We weren't even looking at it from the AIDS angle.

985
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,060
Sue doesn't agree that people want to fuck the giant pizza.

986
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,500
Sue can't get there with her.

987
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,420
What, Justin, this isn't just a, this isn't a munch quad.

988
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,420
This is the greatest news article ever written.

989
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,340
This is the greatest interviewing ever, ever done.

990
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,540
Michael Dresser, you fucking genius.

991
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,500
Okay, thank you.

992
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,100
At Michael Dresser, by the way,

993
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
in case you want to just thank Michael,

994
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Michael T. Dresser, excuse me.

995
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
In case you want to thank Michael, he's retired now,

996
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,740
but you can still thank him for his amazing work,

997
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,100
which I'm not finished with.

998
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,140
What is the statute of limitations for a Pulitzer, by the way?

999
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,260
Is it too late?

1000
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,980
That's a weird way of asking the question,

1001
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,820
but in this case, it does apply.

1002
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,460
In any case, Domino's competitors have no intention

1003
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,820
of trying to go at one bigger.

1004
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,460
We think it's the right size pizza

1005
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,380
for what our customer is looking for.

1006
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,740
Rob Dowdy, a spokesman at Pizza Hut headquarters

1007
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,100
in Wichita, Kansas said yesterday,

1008
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,860
teenagers tend to travel in packs, in groups,

1009
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,100
and usually they're a bit short of cash.

1010
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
So this is the kind of product they're looking for.

1011
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,100
Mr. McIntyre said he could not say

1012
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,580
whether the Dominator will be sold in the Baltimore market

1013
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,820
because the decision on whether to carry the product

1014
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,500
will be left to individual operators.

1015
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,380
Now, a spokeswoman at the regional office,

1016
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,660
Michael Dresser putting in the work, the shoe leather.

1017
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,660
A spokeswoman at the regional office said

1018
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,900
she did not know whether Baltimore area franchisees

1019
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,940
would be interested.

1020
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,260
I assure you, ma'am, they will be.

1021
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,500
In any case, Mr. McIntyre said Domino's

1022
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,300
will be heavily promoting the Dominator in a few months.

1023
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,220
Quote, it's a big, colossal, humongous pizza,

1024
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,220
and we're looking at ads that will come across

1025
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,100
in a big, colossal, humongous way.

1026
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,640
Epilogue.

1027
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Joseph Simone, president of Mama Ilardo's Corp,

1028
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,420
said his relatively small Owings Mills-based pizza chain

1029
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,820
would not be intimidated by its bigger rivals,

1030
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,780
nor will it be drawn into an effort at topping them.

1031
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,020
Quote, you can't serve top quality ingredients

1032
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,140
in a product that size and not price yourself

1033
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,140
out of the market, he said.

1034
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,140
It's like the difference between making sauce

1035
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,660
for two people and making sauce for the 5th Infantry.

1036
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,160
Huh.

1037
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,840
The end.

1038
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,660
I guess I've never thought of it that way.

1039
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,180
Travis, just let it.

1040
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,300
Just give it a moment.

1041
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,800
Let it breathe.

1042
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,500
Just give it a moment.

1043
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,560
The end.

1044
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,740
Thank you, Michael Dresser.

1045
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,740
Thank you, Michael Dresser, thank you for this fantastic,

1046
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,340
fantastic piece.

1047
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,340
You really put literally tens of thousands of times

1048
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,500
the amount of effort this story required of you,

1049
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,620
and you put in the fucking work, and thank you.

1050
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,500
I appreciate you.

1051
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,000
Thank you.

1052
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,020
This is the best news story I've read,

1053
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,380
certainly in the past few weeks.

1054
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,260
I would like to think that after this was published,

1055
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,300
that Michael's bosses said like, okay,

1056
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,860
we're moving you to like cover homicide.

1057
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,620
Like, okay, yeah, right.

1058
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,780
I don't know if Michael Dresser is writing

1059
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,660
about current sort of pandemic events,

1060
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,300
but I hope he does not apply the same level

1061
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,380
of frivolity to it.

1062
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,340
I'm sure he doesn't.

1063
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,820
I bet he matches the tone of the news he's writing.

1064
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,300
It is not like, holy smokes.

1065
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,460
It's the disease.

1066
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,500
Like, probably not like that.

1067
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,540
My corona.

1068
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,700
Yeah, yeah.

1069
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,620
He retired in December of 2018

1070
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,860
as the state house correspondent for the Baltimore Sun.

1071
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,060
Hell yes.

1072
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,340
Got out on top.

1073
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,500
Michael Dresser, you absolute legend.

1074
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,300
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by a few people.

1075
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,860
Thank you.

1076
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,380
It's Yahoo Answers user Varsha who asks,

1077
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,940
and there may not be much meat on these bones,

1078
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,340
but there's something in here that really busted me up.

1079
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:55,220
Varsha asks, I cried more during the death of Optimus Prime

1080
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,900
than I cried during the Titanic.

1081
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,620
Is that okay?

1082
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,420
Updated two days ago.

1083
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,700
I didn't really care that much.

1084
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,980
Felt it was so stupid.

1085
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,580
Would have frozen with him, lol.

1086
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,820
Updated again two days ago.

1087
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,300
But every time I see Optimus Prime die

1088
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,340
in the cartoon especially,

1089
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,980
I don't care if I saw a Kevin Hart video prior.

1090
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,180
I lose all control.

1091
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:14,980
Anyone agree?

1092
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,480
Ow.

1093
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,820
Third update.

1094
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,380
Third update, how he stab Optimus Prime.

1095
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,500
That like our father.

1096
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,900
That like our father.

1097
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,380
It's true.

1098
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:31,460
That's true and good and I like to cry

1099
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,940
and I like to watch stuff that makes me cry.

1100
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,620
Grey's Anatomy when sad stuff happens on there.

1101
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,180
Grey's is a perfect example

1102
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,740
because I could watch 10 Kevin Hart videos before then

1103
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,660
and it would still-

1104
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,020
That's a lot, Griffin.

1105
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,700
That's a lot of Kevin Hart videos.

1106
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Yeah, no, I would need to go to Grey's Anatomy Hospital,

1107
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,980
whatever it's called,

1108
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,660
to get them to sew up the stitches

1109
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,380
from the splits in my belly

1110
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,180
that I have from watching 10 Kevin Hart videos in a row.

1111
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,780
But then I would cry at the sad drama

1112
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,980
because a bus would crash into the hospital or something

1113
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,940
and it would cancel out all the Kevin Hart videos.

1114
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,440
Yeah.

1115
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,260
But isn't that important?

1116
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,340
Staying equalized.

1117
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,660
It's really is important.

1118
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,620
I think feeling the full spectrum of human emotion is key.

1119
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,180
Wouldn't it?

1120
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,980
Okay, listen, it's 2020 times they have a changed

1121
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,900
and I would like to announce here my change.org petition

1122
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,820
to remake the James Cameron Titanic

1123
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,820
and this time as the iceberg is coming,

1124
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,020
the ship transforms into a big transformer.

1125
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,500
The iceberg turns into a big-

1126
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,460
Yeah, this is fucking-

1127
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,900
Slow down, this is fucking cool.

1128
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,780
Yeah, this is cool, dude.

1129
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:56,020
It's not funny, but I feel like I'm at a fucking cool movie.

1130
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,980
Oh, this isn't-

1131
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,220
Sorry, I moved away from comedy podcasts

1132
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,460
to just like I'm pitching my new movie.

1133
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,020
No, I know, we don't do badass stuff on this podcast enough.

1134
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,220
So let's not do-

1135
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,740
Don't do any more jokes, Travis.

1136
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,860
Please tell me why-

1137
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,140
Actually, stop, stop.

1138
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,380
Start at the beginning of the movie.

1139
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,300
Shot one, what are we looking at here?

1140
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,620
Do we get to know that the Titanic is a transformer

1141
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,380
before this happens or what?

1142
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,820
No, up to this point,

1143
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,140
we have no idea that the ship is a transformer.

1144
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,740
So it's basically the same movie

1145
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,060
right up until the fateful collision,

1146
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,740
that one dark, cold night, okay.

1147
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,260
Yes, and then it's like the ship transforms

1148
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,780
and you're like, what, what is happening?

1149
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,700
But then the iceberg transforms too

1150
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,420
and the iceberg is the Decepticon, right?

1151
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,740
So now they're fighting, right?

1152
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,420
And meanwhile, Jack and Rose, who are together,

1153
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,100
and spoiler alert, they both live,

1154
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,900
they're inside of Titanic's head, right?

1155
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,700
Talking to him and they're kind of the buddies, right?

1156
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,740
And they're working together.

1157
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,620
And then Voltron shows up and Voltron's there

1158
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,140
and they're like, Voltron?

1159
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,940
And he's like, yeah, I gotta stop these Kaijus.

1160
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,820
I don't like it anymore.

1161
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,660
Wait, it comes back around.

1162
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,060
It's not gonna come back around.

1163
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,300
And then what's that?

1164
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,540
Is the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

1165
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,580
Stop, it's done.

1166
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,300
They were inside, the cars were inside Titanic's belly.

1167
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,580
Oh, hold on, I'm coming back.

1168
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,140
And they were like Titanic's baby.

1169
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,380
And then we have a long birthing scene

1170
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,220
where the iceberg is a trained.

1171
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,740
Listen, I'm not done.

1172
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,820
Iceberg is a trained OBGYN.

1173
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,220
And enemies become friends when Iceberg the Decepticon

1174
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,980
helps deliver Titanic's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers babies.

1175
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,060
And let me teach you with this, Travis, if you don't mind,

1176
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,300
we can bring in sort of the dino sort of aesthetic from that.

1177
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,340
And it can be called,

1178
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,300
and the Iceberg Decepticon can be called GinoBot.

1179
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,340
And he is a dinosaur.

1180
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,300
Ooh, yes, yes, yes.

1181
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,580
But he's gonna help open up the cargo bay, I guess,

1182
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,580
which would be like the, you know, the fallopian canal.

1183
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,820
It's been a while since I've rushed up on that stuff, but-

1184
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,780
No, you nailed it.

1185
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,100
And then Voltron uses his mighty space sword

1186
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,700
to cut the umbilical cord.

1187
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,740
I don't want Voltron there.

1188
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,860
We got, you can't cross-

1189
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,740
But he's a doula.

1190
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,180
I know Voltron's a trained doula, Travis.

1191
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,580
It's just, he would be so useful in this time, you know?

1192
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,500
I know.

1193
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:24,900
Doula.

1194
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,700
He's a doula.

1195
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,900
I think that's cool.

1196
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,620
And then after that fight, wait,

1197
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,060
do they keep fighting after the birth?

1198
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,100
Yeah, once the Megazord is out.

1199
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,460
Right.

1200
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,100
Yeah.

1201
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,340
Then they keep fighting, I assume Transformer wins.

1202
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:42,740
Okay.

1203
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,060
Yeah.

1204
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,260
And then do we see the ship continue its journey on

1205
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,700
for another couple hours until it docks in America safely?

1206
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,100
Yep.

1207
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,500
All right.

1208
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,700
But then America turns into a Decepticon.

1209
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,660
No, stop.

1210
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,300
It already did.

1211
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,460
That's how we set up the cliffhanger, Griffin,

1212
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,060
for Titanic 2, Titanic.

1213
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,660
Is there more Porkin then in the back half of the movie?

1214
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,620
Oh, yeah.

1215
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,480
Okay.

1216
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,140
But-

1217
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,940
Yeah.

1218
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:16,500
There's a long scene where Titanic and Voltron very sensuously make love.

1219
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,300
I don't like it.

1220
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,260
Is there one where Voltron and Billy Zane-

1221
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,420
I want Voltron and Billy Zane to figure out how that would work even.

1222
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,060
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,540
Well, that happens actually at the beginning of the-

1224
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,980
Sorry, there is now a new scene at the beginning of the movie

1225
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,340
where Billy Zane draws Voltron like one of his French girls.

1226
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,500
So then when it's referenced again later,

1227
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,420
now it's like, oh, you stole that from Billy Zane and Voltron.

1228
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah, I would love it if we could get Kathy Bates

1229
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,180
to have some sort of private scene with a huge robot.

1230
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,060
Oh, yeah.

1231
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,980
That would be fucking rad, dude.

1232
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,460
Yeah, dude.

1233
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,820
This version of the movie is way better.

1234
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,300
Do you think that Voltron is the last one of the great roles

1235
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,740
that Kathy Bates has yet to play?

1236
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,700
Like she's done so many of the great roles

1237
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,700
and it feels like Voltron's kind of the last one.

1238
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,660
She could film that for hours.

1239
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,740
If my agent called me with your pitch, Travis,

1240
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,500
I would be the whole time, pretend I'm Kathy Bates,

1241
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,460
I'd be like, yes, yes, loving it, loving it, loving it.

1242
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I will play Voltron.

1243
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,700
No, no, no, Kathy, you're actually a character in it.

1244
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Kathy Bates is in it as Kathy Bates.

1245
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,580
No, absolutely not.

1246
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,780
I will play Kathy Bates.

1247
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,580
And then sort of in Norbis style,

1248
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,820
I will also play the Voltron in it.

1249
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,340
I will be the Kathy Bates and the Voltron.

1250
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,780
Now, not piloting Voltron.

1251
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,260
You're saying Voltron is Kathy Bates.

1252
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,940
It's a big, yeah, Kathy Bates.

1253
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,620
And we'll dress her up in cardboard boxes.

1254
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,420
That's not our department.

1255
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:38,980
That's not our thing.

1256
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,140
The whole thing, the whole bit, the whole bit.

1257
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,540
I should mention, Jack doesn't survive once they get to America,

1258
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,100
but it's for completely unrelated reasons.

1259
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,260
He falls coming off the ship like a dick shit.

1260
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,100
Well, Griffin, I-

1261
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,380
Sorry, oh, I forgot.

1262
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,340
Yeah, I don't want to spoil it,

1263
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,100
but he falls coming down the ramp and he slips,

1264
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,100
he falls and his whole head pops off.

1265
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,260
And everyone's like, what a fucking idiot.

1266
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,980
Yep.

1267
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,260
Did you see that?

1268
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,340
He made it all this way, oh God.

1269
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,660
And we put up signs that said, be careful.

1270
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,660
Slippery.

1271
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,420
Slippery Wind Voltron.

1272
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,060
Yep.

1273
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,100
That's the name of the movie.

1274
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,020
And this episode.

1275
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,620
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1276
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,740
We very much appreciate you.

1277
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,300
We hope you're hanging in there and doing all right,

1278
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,420
you know, all things considered.

1279
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,740
We are well, you know, all things considered.

1280
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,900
So we hope that you can find a way to be so too.

1281
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,540
Promotioning things, anything in the tank.

1282
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,620
Oh, this is less a promotion and more of like,

1283
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,620
may I call by a guess, but DFTBA is of course,

1284
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,340
a big building filled with people.

1285
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,740
And so they have been quarantined as well.

1286
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,860
And people have been sent home.

1287
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,820
They don't work.

1288
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,380
So products might be delayed reaching you.

1289
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,980
If so, we're sorry.

1290
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,740
It's completely unexpected.

1291
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,140
And how do you even plan for something like that?

1292
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,060
But we'll eventually get to you.

1293
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,340
We're sorry for any delays.

1294
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,100
There's really not.

1295
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,460
I mean, thanks to John Roderick

1296
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,060
and the Long Winters for a theme song.

1297
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,140
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1298
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,980
It's a great song and it's a great dude

1299
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,100
and a great maximum fun for having us on the network.

1300
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,180
They've got all kinds of wonderful shows on there.

1301
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,820
And we're so excited to be a part of it.

1302
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,500
And yeah, let's wrap it.

1303
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,100
If you're bored, we've been trying to put out

1304
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,300
like more stuff on our YouTube channel.

1305
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,780
Yes.

1306
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,380
Try to create something, anything for people to think about

1307
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,020
beyond just like being stuck at home.

1308
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,900
So you can check that out.

McElroy Family on YouTube.

1310
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,820
Yeah, let's wrap it up.

1311
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,700
I got a final one here.

1312
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,860
This is a fun one.

1313
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,620
This one was sent in also by Graham Roebuck.

1314
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,100
Thank you, Graham.

1315
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1316
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,220
Well, it's W-E-W-E, which I assume is just wee wee.

1317
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,700
Asked, turtle pregnancy.

1318
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,100
