1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, on the first in line Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's time right now to slow it down, put a little soul in your bowl

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you want the very best in your life

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is correct

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He has a new microphone

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you like that? Do you like this people?

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We decided the smartest thing to spend your money on that you bought the t-shirts is to put it back into My Brother, My Brother and Me

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So it's like you're not lining our pockets, you're lining your ear meat

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So we spent $300 on new microphones and the other $300 we're gonna spend to get Eddie Murphy on the show

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For just one episode

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just one episode, guest spot, nothing off limits, no rules

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You would think $300 wouldn't be enough to net a performance by Axel Foley but I guess he's falling on hard times

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's plenty to get for Pluto Nash

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know what I'm saying? Meet Dave Cash, those residuals just aren't what he hoped they would be

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't understand why Hanan Mansion wasn't as big as I thought it would be

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm Griffin McElroy by the way, you guys didn't let me

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There's a reason

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look at Travis using the power of his microphone to silence others

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you guys say we just chill this show?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Just take it easy right?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just hang out

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, let's do a couple easy questions first, some slow balls

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
First let me take off my pants, hold on

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank God he has a new microphone that we can listen to it in perfect audio quality

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, ready to go

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is for FormSpring, I have a mane of hair that helps break the ice with nearly everyone I meet

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Jesus man, what kind of product are you putting in your hair?

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, my drink is warmer than it was, you broke all my ice

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lots of people recognize me because of it

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I want a job, and looking the way I do, no one will employ me

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Should I sacrifice popularity for a job or remain penniless yet cool?

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's nothing cool about being penniless

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've never seen a homeless man with a great head of hair

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, no one's like, hey, the moths in your hair are really sexy, you seem like a cool guy

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is that, bubble gum? I like that, looks nice

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In your nose? You're a hobo

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Listen, I think there's a way to have your cake and eat it too

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There have got to be jobs out there that you can find employ at while being so hirsute

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You could join Rusted Root, you could become a permanent member of the band Rusted Root

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You could work as a bouncer at your local hookah bar

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You could become a barista at an independent coffee shop

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, they frown on that shit

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They don't want your face pubes in a macchiato

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How did this come from he has a big head of hair and he has face pubes?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I took it like a beard too

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When he says mane, I'm thinking like a lion's mane going all the way around his head

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You think when you read mane, it's like rapping beats

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When you read mane, you think he's got a ring of hair around his head like a lion

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, like a lion

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How did you get to be as old as you are and not know what things are?

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You don't know things that are things about them

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't know the things

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't leave the house that much

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Justin, that kind of thing comes with a new microphone

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That kind of clarity and understanding

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My brother, my brother and me, what can I do to build my confidence

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I can go out there and meet some new ladies around my age

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Or is focusing on school and work now, meeting someone if I'm lucky and okay strategy for the next couple of years

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's like I'm desperate for some action

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I just wonder if I'm making a mistake by not going out there and making myself available

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Kevin

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I hope that ladder strategy is a good one

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I sure hope so

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you think it's going to be like a pizza delivery girl?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have these 24 buffalo wings that you ordered with extra blue cheese

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey, you are cute

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nice tip, do you want to go on a date?

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Blue cheese is my favorite too

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Listen, Kevin, cut your fingernails, take the boards off the windows

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Get out there, meet some people

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Stop living, I am legend

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Get out there

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a sad fact of reality, Kevin

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But here's the thing, okay

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe you are going to meet your special lady

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Maybe you are going to be the kind of guy who just walks into a gas station one day and there she is

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But statistically speaking, that somebody special is going to be a special somebody if you expose yourself to more members of the opposite sex

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just science

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Metaphorically

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't really expose yourself, we don't want to be a party to that

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't know you might meet a special someone in federal prison

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Kevin, you got to get out there, you got to say hi

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
As far as building confidence goes, you got to not be afraid to fail

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Unfortunately, it's not going to be a confidence builder right away, especially if you are not good at it

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Just don't fail in front of anybody

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because that will be so embarrassing

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why don't you take her into a dark abandoned alley where no one can see and fail

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's a good opening line too

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'd like to take you, I'm about to hit on you, but I'd like to take you to a dark abandoned alley to do it in

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because I don't want anybody to see

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That should be a pretty good ice breaker

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's no mane of hair as an ice breaker, but it is a pretty good one

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll tell you this, you'll get a reaction every time and that's what you're looking for

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Something will happen

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're just looking for a reaction

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can get strong by being constantly rejected, that's how some people would do it

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Just build up that thick hide

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Really, just scars across your heart

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You could just walk up to girls randomly and say, no thanks

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then walk away

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Say you're mass rejecting lots of girls without ever risking being rejected

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Take it a step further, walk into a bar and announce at the top of your lungs

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't want to sleep with any of you

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Walk through it and then walk out

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Sorry ladies, off limits

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They will flock to you as you leave the bar

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get a t-shirt that says, sorry ladies, off limits

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I bet that t-shirt would work for you

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I bet that would work

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Young man, just use your test submission

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You two work it out

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Travis, go

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was just going to say, there was a comedian once who said the best way to get a woman to sleep with you

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is to walk in and tell her that you are bad at sex

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I was just going to say, approach women and say

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I am awkward and uncomfortable and don't know how to talk to women

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And just lead with that

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's my advice, go Griffin, go

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yahoo Answers user Tessa Mission asks

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh this was sent in by a Twitter user Mr. D Muffin

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So thank you Mr. D Muffin

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Tessa Mission asks, when I move out I want to adopt a whole family from Ethiopia

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have a heart for starving children and I'm about to move out

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm getting a 149 acre home and I plan to have a farm

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I would like to help a family out and adopt a whole family

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And build them their own little house on my land

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And share a little bit of land for them

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was wondering if they would let me take them out of their country without a passport or

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, that's how it works

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You need to make sure you poke holes in the box

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure what you just described was light slavery

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mild slavery

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Just maybe a little, a touch of slavery

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's like, you just described like the PG-13 edited for TV version of Roots

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I just want to adopt this family from another nation

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you with me so far?

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They can live on my, I wouldn't call it a plantation, but it is plantation sized

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A fun-tation

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A fun-tation, sure

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't grow any crops yet

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I'm thinking about getting in the crop game

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know it would be handy if they wanted to help out

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What kind of crops?

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Room and board

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, textiles

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Textiles?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mostly

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So they're going to be picking felt

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Felt, hemp, stuff along those lines

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to build them a house though

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not a big house

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
More like a room

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But not a small house, right?

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Not tiny

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I imagine when I adopt them, at first they'll be really scared

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Because they're not going to know what's going on

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They may resist even

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But you know, I think eventually they'll appreciate the fulfillment

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A fulfilling day of work can provide

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So yeah, so lady, you don't have a heart for starving children

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You are a slave master

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're a slave master

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That is illegal, what you just described

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's the warm feeling she gets from the terrified looks on their faces

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's all the payment she needs

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it okay

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And their free labor

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it okay to pee in the bathroom sink if you're drunk?

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I ran the faucet for a while, if that helped

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Read the last

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Peace

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Read it all together

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Making sure that you add that last word

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Because it really makes it

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is it okay to pee in the bathroom sink if you're drunk?

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I ran the faucet for a while, if that helped

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Peace

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nick

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I am

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Before I answer your question

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I am put off by the change of tense

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In the middle of your question

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because you went from like

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Right after the question mark

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then are retroactively asking our forgiveness

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's the context to me

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's the hidden meaning between the lines

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Or the question marks in this case

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He didn't pee in my bathroom sink though

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So he has nothing to

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He has nothing to ask forgiveness for

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's a good question, are you peeing in your own bathroom sink?

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Or like the bathroom sink at a bar

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Because that's not okay

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sure if we did a silent canvas

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Of the three people on this podcast

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We could probably find

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
One person who has peed

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In the bathroom sink

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
On a regular basis

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Not anymore, but used to

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're thinking just one?

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh Jesus

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Statistically speaking, at least one person on this podcast

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
At least one

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Definitely less than three

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, I think that

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have to ask this question

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is the compulsion for peeing in the sink?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's just there and you're just like

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Especially when you've been drinking

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know if you're like

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Throwing off society's rules

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or just saying you're your own man

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And you pee where you want

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I mean, it's a pretty sucky revolution

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because it's still like going on the same spot

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So you're not exactly

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You know

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They're not making post avoid signs about it

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, I mean it's kind of

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It has to be an act of rebellion

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You think it is, not a good one

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Not like a super rebellious one

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just clean it up afterwards

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He ran the faucet if it helps

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think what we've agreed on is it's not okay

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
To pee in the sink if you're drunk

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But if you're sober, it's totally cool

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, I just want it to be a choice

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey guys, I'm in love with my best friend of two years

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I'm not sure if she likes me back

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Any advice?

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You should move away

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Move away, change your name

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or I got an alternate

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How about this?

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ask her

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Pussy

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Just

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why would you ask her pussy?

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We need to get the punctuation straight in that sentence

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Ask her pussy or

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Ask her pussy

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now, get a defining rod

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I say that

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I call you

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That name, which I shouldn't be using

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Female genitalia as a slang term

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm gonna say wimpo

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What about wiener?

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Ask her wiener

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Stop being a wiener and ask her wiener

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I say that with love

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She's your best friend two years

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's at one thirty fifth of your life

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Statistically speaking

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How about you just ask her and either get to Frenchin

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Or beat cheeks out of there

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And keep this in mind, when you ask her

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And if she says no

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You do have to move away

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So there's your answer

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Now do me a favor and stop listening so I can give everyone else an answer

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She doesn't like him

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, that's not true

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, that's not true

275
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If after two years he doesn't know

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If she likes him back

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Dude's shy

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Listen, form spring dude, just ask her

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Trust me

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Cause that's gonna be the best day ever

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If it works

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If we were her mom

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Ask her mom if she likes him

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yahoo Answers user

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Gally McClarr

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Nah

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You just wanna go ahead and

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not a name

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, the name is David

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
David asks

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Does a woman ever love a stalker?

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
A stalker

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Who stalks 24-7

294
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
From childhood to adulthood

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
For five long years

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Wait, what?

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, there are layers

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Whoa, there are many things happening here

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I am uncomfortable with

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wait, is there more to the question?

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There are additional details that say

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean from teen to adult age

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So I would say

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Maybe

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And also my delete key is broken so I can't edit

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That thing I said just a second ago

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
16 to 21, I'll say

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But here's the thing

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm gonna put it in this shit and kick it down another level

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Incept it

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm gonna incept it

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Is this the stalker asking the question?

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Or is it the stalkie?

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh my god

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You just blew my mind

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
My mind is blown, you think that maybe she's like

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Listen

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't wanna give everybody the wrong idea about stalking

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But sometimes

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It works

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like maybe

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, maybe she actually kinda likes this dude

325
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That she sees occasionally going through her trash

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But she doesn't know if it's okay to like him

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
She hated

328
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And hated it and was scared of it

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And couldn't stand it and then

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
After years of it

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not that she loves it

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
She's used to it, it's like the new Arcade Fire album

333
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You just

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait and wait and wait and eventually

335
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You get him

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And finally you get this stalker

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You understand where he's coming from

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You just gave me an idea

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If I ever stalk someone

340
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm gonna put on a giant raccoon suit

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Before I start going through their trash

342
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That buys me like 20 minutes

343
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Honey, honey

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Honey, don't move

345
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Don't move, but look out the window

346
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They can smell fear

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That ring-tailed bastard

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey, I've wanted braces for a couple of years now

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And have finally gone to the orthodontist

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I was expecting to pay around

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
1800 to 2000

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Squiggle marks

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I believe that's pounds

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Is it pound or is it lira?

355
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Which even at that amount would be very

356
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Really difficult for me to pay, but once I got to the orthodontist

357
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He told me it would cost 3200

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Lira, euro, pounds

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
To have braces

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This amount would mean a huge commitment

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Over two years of my life. I'm only 18

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And want to go to university next year

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
My teeth are not extremely crooked, but they definitely need braces

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Should I plunge into debt for a couple of years

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
With the reward of straight teeth

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Or wait it out until I'm 24 to 25

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Or maybe never

368
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know who to ask, please help

369
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thanks, David

370
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I do want to point out

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He didn't type

372
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Not extremely crooked, but they definitely

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Need braces

374
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He says not extremely crooked, but they defiantly

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Need braces, which I like

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're like, hey, hey, listen

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm your teeth, deal with it

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Give me some braces, you bastard

379
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Give me braces

380
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
David, again, I can't

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Say this enough, I know I brought it up

382
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
In a few episodes, but I was the only

383
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Macaroy fortunate enough

384
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
To know the sweet embrace

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Of braces

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There's no amount

387
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Too high for that feeling

388
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You know how

389
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You know how in your life

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You have these random things where

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Everyone's staring at my eyebrow

392
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Everyone's looking at my

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This zit on my cheek

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Everyone looks at your teeth

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It is actually true

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Look to your grill, get that grill fixed

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because when you talk, everyone's

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Looking at your mouth

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's true

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You could just tell people

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
To deal with it

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey, save some money

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Get a tattoo on your lip that says deal with it

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That would be way cheaper

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's something people are going to remember

406
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Whatever happened to David

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Who used to come around, I don't remember David

408
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But I do remember a guy who had a tattoo

409
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
On his lip that said deal with it

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I respected him for it

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Can the top lip say yeah, I know

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And the bottom lip say deal with it

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, and on the inside

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You pull down your lower lip and there's a

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Chinese character for strength

416
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Have you thought about getting like

417
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A grill, like getting

418
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Gold teeth, diamonds

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh my god, yes, that's gotta be cheaper

420
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But if you've got a fucked up grill

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And you get a real grill on top of it

422
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're gonna look like a Bond villain

423
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes

424
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why are you listing things that are positives

425
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And pretending they're negatives

426
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why is that not awesome

427
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm saying either

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Get that sweet embrace

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Because it feels so good, I gotta tell you

430
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Having your teeth move around

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's an experience

432
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Do you think they would sell better if they were called

433
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Embraces

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Embraces? I don't think so

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I would buy them, I don't even need them

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Or just be confident

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Because people find confidence in faults

438
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Sexy, that's why Kirsten Dunst is

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
As famous as she is nowadays

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
She's got a grill that looks like

441
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
She stopped a train with her teeth

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I wouldn't go that far

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But I do know what you're saying

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Confidence, if you don't pretend

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a thing, other people won't even notice

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You know what gives someone confidence?

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Having $3200 in their pocket

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well

449
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Not dollars though, I don't know

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It might be really cheap

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know what this money means

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is it rubles, do people still use those

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Rubles? I think it's shekels

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Shekels?

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Brothers 3, help me out

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At the moment

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm in algebra class I failed last year

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And I got stuck with the same

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Old bag lecturer

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I need to pass this class to get my

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Engineering degree, Josh from Gmail

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Josh didn't explicitly state

463
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
A problem in this question

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, it sounds like

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Josh, you're on the right track

466
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not good at

467
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Algebra, like if you

468
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You've come to the exact wrong place

469
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If that's what you're looking for

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Geometry may be something

471
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You gotta cheat, which is how I got through

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Both of my high school algebra classes

473
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Go on

474
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You sit near a smart kid who wants

475
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Friends

476
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey Josh, I'm gonna hit you with something

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Kinda pull the camera back a little bit

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's zoom out for a second

479
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Maybe you

480
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Are in the wrong field

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Maybe

482
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You aren't

483
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Cut out for this, maybe this isn't

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Your right calling if you're having such trouble

485
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, math is

486
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Kind of important in engineering, isn't it?

487
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, it seems like you need to know this shit

488
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
If it's this tough for you

489
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
They build bridges and shit, right?

490
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, I kinda want you on point

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I kinda want you to be like

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Really bomb at this class

493
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I would like you to leave the class

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Stand up and walk out

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And be like, no bridges for me, thanks

496
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You know what has never

497
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've never been walking across a bridge

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And had someone say, you know who built this bridge?

499
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The guy who can't do algebra

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And just felt awash with confidence

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, I remember when I

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Built this bridge, that was the third time I felt

503
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Algebra, and hey, it's not my fault

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I was in the same lecture, but I did drop out of school

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't know why they didn't let me make a bridge

506
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I am good at Legos

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's only cause it's up

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You gotta let a boat through

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Josh

510
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Just stand up and

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Announce to the class that algebra

512
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Is useless, and see how the teacher

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Reacts, she may

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He or she, I guess old bag

515
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That sounds like a she, she may

516
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Wink out of existence when faced with

517
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That sort of incontrovertible

518
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Logic

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I did that to a social studies teacher one time

520
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Did you? Did it work?

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I said, this is so pointless, I will never use this

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Information, and then they just

523
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Cease to exist

524
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Stand up and yell

525
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You madam have killed the frail

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Old lady that is algebra

527
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And

528
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
See if you can start leading a revolt

529
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, oh

530
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So you want him to kill her, lord of the

531
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Fly style

532
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You know what, I ain't against it, blow that conch shell

533
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Blow that conch shell, get Peggy to

534
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Smother, dear

535
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Mubim Bam, I'm having a bit of difficulty

536
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
With the bros before hoes rule

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, that's not a good start

538
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But keep going, the majority of my friends happen to

539
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Be female, and I only have a few male friends

540
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Would my female friends be considered

541
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Bros and my male friends hoes?

542
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Thanks for your help

543
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No

544
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're doing it wrong

545
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're doing it wrong, bros before

546
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hoes is

547
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Kind of a dumb thing to say

548
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I want to deconstruct it and take you back

549
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You

550
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
There is, bros before hoes

551
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Is something that men

552
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Say to each other to make themselves

553
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Feel better, because

554
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I want to take you

555
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Real deep in here, it's always hoes

556
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Before bros

557
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's always women, always girls

558
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's peel back another layer

559
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They're not thinking about you

560
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Peel back another layer though, because the bigger problem

561
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Here is that you are

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Unironically using the word bro

563
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And hoe

564
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't know which one's worse

565
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Both pretty bad

566
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They're both really bad

567
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Uh, I

568
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How about

569
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sounds like you're in a chicks before dicks

570
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Kind of situation

571
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
In any event

572
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Your male friends would never

573
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Be your hoes, that is

574
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It is important to know

575
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Here's a good test

576
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Gather all your

577
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Male friends together at Giovanni's

578
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Walk into Giovanni's and say what's up my hoes

579
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Sup hoes

580
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
See how that goes over

581
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The thing is, the phrase bros before

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hoes is something that the other

583
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Guys use

584
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
To keep you

585
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
From like, ditching them

586
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's not like, it's nothing

587
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Any guy has ever sat down and go, you know

588
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'd love to go home with this lady

589
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But bros before hoes, I suppose

590
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It does

591
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Bros before hoes, I suppose, should be the new one

592
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Bros before hoes

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Only apply, Travis is right

594
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's never a life choice, like

595
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Guy post, you never say like

596
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I should go to my best friend

597
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Tommy's bar mitzvah

598
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But I have a date with

599
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This girl who is very attractive

600
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well bros before hoes, it's not

601
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Like that, it's something where he calls you

602
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And says hey, I'm gonna

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Invoke bros before hoes I suppose

604
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Are you?

605
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You got me good

606
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I've been trying to think of a bros before

607
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Hoes except after

608
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Joe's, it's escaping me

609
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Except after

610
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Moe's, cause if you've had Moe's burritos

611
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You can just go home

612
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Bros before hoes except after Moe's

613
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Also

614
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It does work

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
For your literal bros

616
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah, always

617
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Push comes to shove

618
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Your real

619
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Biological bros

620
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And we are

621
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We are your biological brothers

622
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I've been doing that wrong

623
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
For years

624
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Biobros before hoes

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What you want to say

626
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Biodome before hoes

627
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Late to the fad on twitter asks if

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Is pronounced MBMBAM

630
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are the fans

631
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
MBMBAMBinos

632
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think that's kinda fresh

633
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not crazy about it

634
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Only the dudes

635
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I kinda like Mambas

636
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Or MBMBAMBinos

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't know, we need some

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Fans here, let us know on twitter

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What you like

640
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
If there's a different one you like

641
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Can we pick out someone who's our greatest fan

642
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And call them the great BIMBAMBINO

643
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We can, someone will be

644
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And then our fattest fan

645
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Can be the great HAMBINO

646
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If you

647
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Think you're the fattest MBMBAM

648
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Fan, let us know

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We just pitched the greatest

650
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Reality tv show

651
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Are you the fattest

652
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
MBMBAM fan

653
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think that show is called The Biggest Loser

654
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And it already exists

655
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So if you are

656
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
MBMBAM's fattest fan

657
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You send in an email or a tweet

658
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
With your current

659
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Total weight

660
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
No pictures of your girth

661
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because I ain't trying to get sick over here

662
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Just the facts and figures

663
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Just the stats, and then let us know

664
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000

That's the name of this contest

666
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Just the stats comma fats

667
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000

Free code to download MBMBAM

The app experience

671
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And fats domino stop

673
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Applying

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You are dead

675
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yahoo answers user I look so good without you

MBMBAM's sexiest listener

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No that's not required

679
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yahoo

680
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Answers user

681
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I look so good without you

682
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Asks

683
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Is there, oh jesus

684
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Is there was a disease and it killed everyone

685
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
On this planet except you

686
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And some other person who was ugly

687
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It didn't kill

688
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You two because you were both immune to it

689
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Kind of like in the movie I Am Legend

690
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Except opposite

691
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Would you kill yourself or would you

692
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Continue living and have a sexual relationship

693
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
With that one ugly person

694
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh my god is this person asking

695
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Would you rather kill yourself than

696
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Fucking ugly person

697
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That is exactly what they're asking

698
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Would you rather bring humanity

699
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
To a screeching halt

700
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah

701
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Speaking of

702
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Confidence that's gotta be like the worst hit

703
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like two people left you look

704
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
At them and just say well that ends this

705
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Chapter of humanity I suppose

706
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Dead

707
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Make sure you say something to him before

708
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Cause I want him to live with that

709
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's how humanity should go out

710
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
With a sad person too ugly to have sex with

711
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Not with a bang

712
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But with a suicide

713
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Or a double

714
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Hey

715
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Why don't you just kill that other person

716
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean doesn't that solve

717
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Your problem

718
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If you

719
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Don't want to have sex with this ugly person

720
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Because you're the last person on earth

721
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Who won't have sex with him don't kill yourself

722
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Why does that even make sense

723
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why do you have to kill yourself

724
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah

725
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Or just junk on him

726
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Whatever

727
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Did the disease also destroy all the bags

728
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
In the world

729
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Come on

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Take care of this

731
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay don't kill yourself

732
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Please for all of us just start

733
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Although you know what I was gonna say

734
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They should not bring humanity to a halt

735
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Think about it half a go kids

736
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Nobody wants that

737
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The whole human race is like

738
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That gene will never come out of the pool

739
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The ugly gene will never

740
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Me oh my father yeah

741
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm 1 16th ugly

742
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
My great great grandmother

743
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Was ugly

744
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hey my bim bam

745
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'd really like to have one of my questions

746
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Answered on the show but my life isn't interesting enough

747
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That I have any questions

748
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You're doing it wrong dude

749
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Can you guys help me out

750
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
To come up with a question to ask you

751
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Alright

752
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm so glad you asked

753
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is a little bit before we get into this

754
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
This is a little bit like

755
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Could god make a rock so big that even he couldn't lift a thing

756
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Right like this is pretty spacey

757
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Should we come up with a question

758
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That we couldn't answer

759
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We may wink this out of existence

760
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But we do need to address

761
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Some things

762
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That have been happening in our lives

763
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In the life of the show

764
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We're so happy that people have been sending in questions

765
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I was

766
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Like from episode 1

767
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We started getting more than enough questions

768
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That we needed to put an episode together

769
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And that's awesome

770
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's really great

771
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But they've started to take

772
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
A turn

773
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What kind of turn

774
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
A turn

775
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Towards

776
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The creepy

777
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I'm not saying all of them

778
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If your question is not on the show

779
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's not because it was creepy

780
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't know

781
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
How to address this

782
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Because I don't want to sound ungrateful

783
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Stop asking us about poop

784
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's a good first step

785
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
If that is even in there

786
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Even as a concept

787
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Just edit it out

788
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Not good

789
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Not a good question

790
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Because we probably won't read that on the show

791
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I can't even say that

792
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because my mic traffic

793
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Is rerouted through China

794
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
They censor anything scatological

795
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That I talk about

796
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So that's pretty whack

797
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Speaking of whack

798
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Maybe don't ask creepy questions

799
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
About like

800
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Jango

801
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Or joing

802
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Or jingo

803
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That probably won't get read either

804
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Or Kimbo slice

805
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And none of that

806
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't ask any of those things

807
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Just ask

808
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Just ask a straight up question

809
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
True from your own life

810
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Not made up

811
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because we know if you're making things up

812
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's pretty obvious

813
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You send in made up things and they're funny

814
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And we appreciate the humor

815
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And it's so awesome that you want to share that

816
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Funny story with us

817
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But we're not going to read it on the show

818
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Probably

819
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I would like to see

820
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
If you can't come up with a question

821
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Or if you've had a question before

822
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And you followed our advice

823
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I would like to know how that worked out for you

824
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We can maybe read some of those

825
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I would remind you

826
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Never follow our advice

827
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But if you do

828
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We are not liable

829
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The best thing we can tell you

830
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Is to ask for advice

831
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
About something

832
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Don't ask a question

833
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Like what's your favorite

834
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Type of hot dog

835
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But ask for advice

836
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Because it's an advice show

837
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Or do what that one guy did

838
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And send us pictures of his girlfriend

839
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That works too

840
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Or tell us how fat you are

841
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So either ask for advice

842
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Tell us how fat you are

843
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Or send us emails about how much you like Griffin

844
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just the stats

845
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Please

846
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I have a two year old son who is awesome

847
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And lately everybody thinks that

848
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Catherine

849
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I have a two year old kid who is dumb

850
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Boring

851
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Do something fun, stupid

852
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I have another one

853
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Ever since I was a little girl

854
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I only wanted one child and I'm not sure if I

855
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Really want another child or I miss having a baby

856
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because my son is getting older

857
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What to do?

858
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's true

859
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I think it would be pretty lonely

860
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Growing up an only child

861
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think you probably have three kids

862
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think that's about the right number

863
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And three boys

864
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Three beautiful bouncing baby boys

865
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Two year old is pretty good

866
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Let's have another one though

867
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Catherine

868
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I want you

869
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
One

870
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You're asking the wrong

871
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You're doing it wrong

872
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You shouldn't ask us if you should have a child

873
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But if you do

874
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And I'm going to wholeheartedly insist that you do now

875
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You have to name it something

876
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Show related because it's very

877
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Existence is thanks

878
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
To my brother, my brother

879
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We basically are going to have a son

880
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The three of us are going to have a son

881
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Pretty soon

882
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We're going to be your child's godparents

883
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
We're it's pod father

884
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Holy shit

885
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That's got to be trademarked somewhere

886
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Just DM it

887
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Copyright

888
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What I want you to do

889
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Is when you get ready

890
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
For the baby making times

891
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
However that works

892
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Play this episode

893
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Put a song in the background

894
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Because we want our son to have a

895
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Strong confident voice in his life

896
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That he can

897
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
He knows that he can turn to whenever he needs anything

898
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Except for money

899
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah

900
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And make sure you play our show on headphones

901
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
On your belly like I see on TV sometimes

902
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
With Mozart and stuff

903
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Baby Einstein tapes

904
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We should make baby Einstein tapes

905
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That'd be great

906
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But it's cool instead of smart

907
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Justin Travis Griffin the third

908
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I love it what about Batman

909
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
See I was thinking Preston

910
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Preston

911
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hi I'm Preston Bim Bam Stevenson

912
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's a pleasure

913
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I want to be the next president of the United States

914
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's what I hear in my head when I hear that

915
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I appreciate your support

916
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I appreciate your support

917
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Third term

918
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Who are these three guys hanging from my coattails

919
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Those are my pod fathers

920
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm going to

921
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Find them lush cabinet positions

922
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
In a lush cabinet

923
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh this is nice this velvet

924
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question

925
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But a couple things

926
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
First if you want to ask

927
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
A question of the show

928
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
All the methods you can do that on are

929
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
At mbnbam.com

930
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We love it when

931
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
People tweet about quotes or how fat they are

932
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Just make sure

933
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You use that mbnbam hashtag

934
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If you

935
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Want to buy something there's a

936
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Buy stuff link there where you can

937
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000

App experience it's two dollars

939
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You can listen to all the shows and ask us

940
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Questions and there's some special

941
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Features and

942
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You can also

943
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You can still

944
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Get T-shirts

945
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The pre-orders are over

946
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But we have some extra supply

947
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So those are available on the site

948
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And those are going to start shipping out

949
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Hopefully this week

950
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And they're going to be shipped in the order

951
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That they were ordered

952
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So if you got on it early

953
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Then they should be there thank you

954
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You guys were so super supportive

955
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
With the T-shirts and

956
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The app and everything and we really

957
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Seriously cannot tell you enough

958
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
How much we appreciate it you guys have been

959
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Super super cool

960
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
About it and make sure when you

961
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Get your T-shirt I want to

962
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
See pictures of everybody

963
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Wearing T-shirts and like

964
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Maybe we can make a page on the site

965
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Where people can just

966
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And not just wearing the T-shirt I would like to see it

967
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In provocative places like

968
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Places where perhaps

969
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
A Hey Jeffrey T-shirt isn't appropriate

970
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah like a funeral

971
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah especially a funeral

972
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Nothing turns a funeral into a funeral

973
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Like a Hey Jeffrey T-shirt

974
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And nothing

975
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Turns a funeral into a funnel

976
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Like a funnel

977
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And uh

978
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
If you know someone who's good at making websites

979
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I think we could use a new one

980
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So let us know

981
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm looking at our website right now

982
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It looks like an ad for the New York Times

983
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But so all that

984
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We should just adopt an Ethiopian family to make us a website

985
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Make that website

986
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
As quick as you want but do make it

987
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
As quick as you want but do make it

988
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And make sure you subscribe to the show

989
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And rate the show

990
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Tell a friend

991
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We have over 400 ratings now which is just

992
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's mind boggling

993
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You guys boggle my mind on a regular basis

994
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
My mind is boggled

995
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
My mind is boggled

996
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Boggleded

997
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Boggling as what?

998
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Zach Stelz on Twitter

999
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
He introduced his boss to the show

1000
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So

1001
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm sorry about getting you fired

1002
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But we do appreciate you spreading the word

1003
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Thank you

1004
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Hit me

1005
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I've been excited to read this question

1006
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I've been excited the whole time

1007
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This question comes to us from

1008
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I think it's Sechal

1009
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
S-E-A-C-H-E-L

1010
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Not a real name

1011
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But here we go

1012
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What's the difference between

1013
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Anorexic and Balsamic?

1014
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Laughing

1015
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh Christ

1016
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Laughing

1017
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm Justin McElroy

1018
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm Travis McElroy

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm Griffin McElroy

1020
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This has been my brother my brother and me

1021
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Kiss your dad square on the lips

1022
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You will never know me

1023
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:55,000
