1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,660
Hello everybody and welcome my brother my brother mean if I show for the modular there is no spoon

9
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,820

10
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Hey, would you have knocked over the vase if I hadn't said anything woof woof big dog Travis woof woof McElroy

11
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,820
What on God's green earth are you two doing? Hi, this is Griffin. What on God's green and blue?

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
Griffin I'm dodging all of your judgments. Whoa

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Whoa

14
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,820
That's right folks we're headed back into the matrix

15
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Matrix resurrections

16
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Matrix resurrections

17
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,520
We're here. We're getting there matrix for Lana Wachowski is gonna take us

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,300
Into her world of the matrix, and we're all gonna go on a journey together

19
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,340
Into the matrix, and that's right. We back out here. I know what you're thinking folks weren't we just in the matrix?

20
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,140
There's no way you could possibly know what I'm thinking at this very moment

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,340
You're thinking weren't we just in the matrix, but the matrix here's the thing about the matrix guys one

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,220
It's way long ago. You don't realize it cuz like you probably just watched them again. Yeah way long ago like

23
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,780
It's true right cuz now it's all computers

24
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,740
Yeah, yeah now. It's all computers online

25
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,540
I can't believe that they're making a fucking matrix film has been so long since last one

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,060
Are you kidding me with this Tara Reeves neo more like although listen hey

27
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Listen the only

28
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,380
Into is Viagra you know

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,820
All right, no, I wouldn't say

30
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,780
Okay, but not at the not at the expense of Keanu Reeves

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,780
I know it's like I'm doing kind of a bit like it's like what kind of jokes are there about matrix

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,620
Those are the jokes that I have about me. Well. Here's the thing I watched the trailer whoa Jonathan Groff's in this bitch

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,940
Yeah, yes, wait don't give away anything else

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,240
Damn cuz Griffin hasn't seen the trailer, but Griffin is a huge matrix

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,760
Code monkey as they can I see can I step outside the bit yeah, I really I really do love those films quite a bit

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah, they're very good

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,040
I mean the first the first the first no they're all good in their own way. They're all very good

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,200
I have like the space orgy underground love that fuck yes

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,760
Fuck so good Griffin. What do you think is revealed in the new trailer?

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,400
the new trailer yeah, or the

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
only one so far if

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,640
If memory serves the end of the third matrix movie was kind of a total party wipe

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,520
The Keanu is in this one is astonishing to me

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,840
It's the resurrection sits right there on the title Griffin. I guess they do say it right there

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,920
They say right there on the tile you're not okay Griffin. I know I'm gonna ask you

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,040
What do you think is in this trailer? I think there's a matrix in the matrix

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,800
I think they want one. I think they went one deeper

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,760
I think that there's the real world in which we are set up by cattle into batteries and the machines love our juices and so

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,040
They put us in matrix so they can take our juices, but then in matrix. It's like but damn

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
There's some good stuff happening here, too

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,520
We're gonna matrix them you know they're on there and there and this is what I'm talking about the phones tik-tok and tumblr all of us

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Are sort of our way out Griffin?

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,880
So you have wait have you'd actually not watch the trailer. I've genuinely not

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Matrix there's a scene in the trailer

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,560
There's a clip where everyone's on their phones and the key on is in an elevator surrounded by people on their phones and a guy

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,200
Loses funny kind of chuckles, and I guess that's a bad thing to find your own entertaining all those guys are on their phones

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
They love to talk believe this yes

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Lana get at me. Let's yes

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,480
Let's collab. This is fucking awesome. I also someone Lily's taking a step back

60
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,520
You need someone to bounce the ideas off right in Griffin get Griffin in Griffin

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600
Which is Griffin in I also I went into it. This is not a joke

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,040
Like joking to myself. I wonder if they'll catch up with what that cat from the like from the like

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Deja vu moment what what that cat's been up to right hats in the trailer

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,800
Cats and Chuck you want to lose your mind Griffin. I'm just gonna five seconds. Here's the last line of the trailer delivered by

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Mr.. Groff himself

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,080
Bringing it are you ready? Yeah, cuz you might get too pumped. It's okay. It's the most trailer line

67
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
You're not gonna fucking believe that. This is the last line of the trailer

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
You're reading a script as an actor, and you get a line like this. You're like well. That's not getting cut

69
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
There's no way all right you ready mm-hmm

70
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,340
After all these years to be going back to where it all started back to the matrix

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,720
Griffin I know I'm thinking is that just a clip from like a red carpet interview that Jonathan Groff did no no no

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
No, that's a scene in the movie. It's in the movie. That's in the matrix all right

73
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
is in it

74
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Is he the new fucking agents agent Smith or whatever he's the new Morpheus. There's four Morphe I

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Actually, that's not actually there's the fire more to it the water Morphe I earth Morphe I and air Morphe I when they get together

76
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Don't think Larry made it for this one well

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,920
I don't think Justin. There's a reason in matrix online

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
more

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
canonically assassinated

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,840
But are you saying Larry is not in this film because he's canonically assassinated in the matrix online

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,760
matrix online

82
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Morpheus is canonically

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,440
Assassinated and so you get a younger

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,120
Hipper Morpheus

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Perhaps part of the resurrections once more cool cool cool Trinity. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

86
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, yeah, and it got a big part looking great by the way has not aged a day

87
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,800
It's that matrix, but he has even killed fucking fantastic. Yeah, I felt bad about like I had it was so funny

88
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Yeah, we remember

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,160
Yeah, I liked in the trailer where there was like you know there's like a voice over

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
And you're like always is he gonna be in it is it gonna be in it is he gonna be in it?

91
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,600
And then you just hear Joey pants like I love steak

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:48,120
I love steak and redheads. Ah, is there a scene... Joey pants ain't in it. He was canonically assassinated in the matrix online. First DLC attack of the cyber machines. Yeah

93
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Is there a scene where

94
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
fucking

95
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,400
Mr. Anderson or Keanu's John Anderson, I think is his name Neo Neo Thomas Anderson

96
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Thomas Anderson, he's at a fucking

97
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,160
Paul Thomas Anderson's at a Panera bread and he gets his bread bowl with his cheese and broccolini soup and

98
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,680
He like reaches into the utensil drawer and grabs a fork and he's like wait a minute. Excuse me, sir

99
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
Where's the spoons and the cashier just smiles and it is the little boy

100
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,060
Can I just say Griffin how you there's no Griffin

101
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,120
It's weird that you knew about the bread bowls because that is actually the new red pill blue pill

102
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, cuz that got all that like you want a broccoli soup. Mr. Anderson, right?

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,400
All that iconography got co-opted by dipshits so you can't do red pill blue pill anymore

104
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah, now it's like do you want the red broccoli cheese soup bread? Yeah, or a slushie. Can I tell you what's wild Griffin?

105
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,760
What all joking aside there is a clip in the trailer where he's like walking through a cafe and

106
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,260
And like looks over and someone's reading Alice through the window glass and I think it's like the prophet. I think it's like

107
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,500
The legs smiles at him. Hey, please go ask Alice is the true

108
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:12,860
But it's kind of exactly oh fucking good he wears there is I mean he's wearing a beanie

109
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,940
He's wearing a beanie and dropping a bunch of his pills down the sink. Yeah like that. I like that

110
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,220
I like that. Is there a gooey mirror? Is there? Yes. Yes. Yes

111
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
He looks in it and he kind of looks like

112
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Looks like all

113
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Yeah

114
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
He looks like

115
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,060
It's dead on Justin. It's right. It's it's weird, right?

116
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,900
It's like the movie the mirror is a Gucci mirror and is also showing the revenant. Yeah

117
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,380
It's a streaming mirror

118
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,120
There's great parts. Like people do

119
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,860
Buildings and then the buildings break and then here's a part where someone shoots a rocket and Neos like I don't think so today

120
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah, thanks. And then you miss a missus a rocket in an air in a different

121
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,020
Rocket bending. It's amazing rocket. No more bullets for me. Thank you. Just right now, but there's a scene

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,980
But let me ask a question they fight with kung-fu in a magical dojo. Okay, but listen in there

123
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
But listen, yeah

124
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,260
What the fuck is Neil Patrick Harris doing in this

125
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Yeah, he just he keeps looking at the camera saying I'm so excited to be in the matrix is why it's why it's amazing

126
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,740
There's a bunch of new characters and I swear to God they have this entire like army that have freed themselves from the gender binary

127
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,300
It's amazing. Yeah, it's an incredible army of

128
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Soldiers

129
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,300
So cool, they're like all the cool I don't love young Morpheus is the one thing

130
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Actually, I

131
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,900
Want to watch it in it. Oh, hey the in it from the video game this. Yeah, canonically the matrix

132
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,940
Yeah from according to IMDB Jada Pinkett Smith who is not she's not just to the video game. She was in. Oh, that's right

133
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,700
That's why she was heavily she was sure didn't have a featured is what you were thinking. Yeah, man

134
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,340
I'm way more plugged into the fucking matrix universe than I assume. Why do you know so much about online?

135
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Maybe you need to unplug a little bit copper top

136
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,340
I love steak. I love steak

137
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,940

In the house somewhere we're gonna fucking VPN into this private server

You can see the death of Morpheus who is canonically assassinated. Yeah, hold on

148
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,980

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,180
Why did you all sleep on that? Like this? What's wrong?

156
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,280
Wachowskis make a movie. We're fucking

157
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,460
Mila Kunis is swarmed by bees who can smell her royalty and fucking there's a dog prince

158
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
And people are like, I don't think we need to see that one

159
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,060
I think we need to skip that one. I don't think we need to see where this one goes like are you sure?

160
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,060
Fuck is the matter with you? They just smell royalty. Are you sure?

161
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,160
Channy's a dog man. All right, we don't deserve him. No. No, we absolutely do not.

162
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
I

163
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,280
Recently switched apartments. Okay. I like setting the thermostat to 69. Yeah, I find it funny

164
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,180
It's also a comfortable temperature. One of my roommates keeps changing it to 70

165
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,040
He's done this multiple times that bums me out every time. Why does he do this? How can I figure out who it is?

166
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,840
What should I do once I know who it is? That's from 69 is a nice temperature

167
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,080
Let's settle. Can we settle this right away? First and foremost 69 is

168
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,760
Quite cold. That's whoa, very chilly. Oh

169
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,320
That is my chosen temp. No, no, you know in your home in your home

170
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,000
I was always so cold there. I love no nice 74

171
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
You want to live in a rainforest

172
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,880
All right, 75 in the daytime 73 at night that two-degree difference. You feel it. You know it you love it

173
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
You have to have it

174
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,360
69 degree. I mean, I guess it depends on where you live in, Texas. I could not I could not maintain

175
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,640
No, an internal temperature of 69 degrees in Texas. No, yeah is where you need to be for a nice sleep

176
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,880
That's what science says but in the during the day, it's hot outside. It should be kind of hot in your house a little bit

177
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't unplug from the world. Yeah

178
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,240
I

179
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,160
want fall all year round

180
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,920
But then that doesn't make it exciting when fall comes and there's a slight chill a slight chill by which I mean

181
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,400
It's like 82 degrees in the morning in Texas here now, and I'm like fucking ready for a flannel time

182
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,260
But if it's if it's 69 in my house all day all in all you got in my house all day

183
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,080
The reason your roommate does this they're appeared all day Justin

184
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,440
40 years old day in do you have an IV going or is this too personal?

185
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,020
Go on Travis. No, let's focus on Travis at being 60 not like that temperature trap. It's too low, but it's too low

186
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,260
You're too low. You're probably I would let it check it. I would shudder to look at your electric bill

187
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,440
I would shudder no because it's a maintaining a constant temperature when it hits that temperature

188
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,480
We have let me be clear everybody very good windows. They really keep that in

189
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,960
We've got blackout curtains. We're in Ohio. It ain't bad

190
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,200
You've made a cave like you've made a bed in that's not something to brag about

191
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,920
That's what oh if I could have

192
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,660
Phosphorescent lighting and that'd be it. Oh, there's just a massive to answer the question like there's a like, you know how

193
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,980
We only put a value on things like a million because we have ten fingers, right? It's like it's all based in

194
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,620
Sure, I mean, I think if you saw a million like bricks you'd be like that's a fuck ton of bricks

195
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,460
No matter how many fingers you have

196
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,700
Yeah

197
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,420
But you wouldn't be more fuck ton of breaks than like 900,000 bricks you would still you would look at that and be like Tim

198
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,700
That's a lot of you don't think you would notice a difference between

199
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,960
100,000 saying you wouldn't notice a difference

200
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,900
I'm saying that when you put that millionth millionth brick on the pile you would turn around and be like everyone

201
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:44,220
I've done something and we're all I see okay, because of my ten fingers. I have achieved it. You know, I mean, I've achieved it

202
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,100
Okay, I feel like 69 and 70 is a large

203
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,020
There's a large psychological gap because in the 69 it could be in the 60s

204
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:00,420
It could be chilly in the 70s. It could be darn right hot and it's like you're in the like that one

205
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,940
Sliver of a degree is actually there's a big psychological difference

206
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,140
So maybe the room is just like god, it's freezing. I'm just gonna turn

207
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:14,860
70 says you are absolutely right because if somebody says it's gonna scoot it up if somebody says oh, it's 69 degrees outside

208
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,220
I'm like, oh first of all, you're like 30 second. Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel like 70 degrees. I'm sorry

209
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm like, oh short sleeves got it. Okay, cool. You're absolutely right Justin 70 degrees is short. Okay, it's

210
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,060
It's right run hot. I know you do. I know you do

211
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,560
I I'm struggling with this question because and I think probably a lot of our listeners are too

212
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,780
because

213
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
70 degrees to me is

214
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,820
Also still pretty cold, but it's not as funny Griffin cuz it's not the sex number

215
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:54,780
It's but that shouldn't be the reason that shouldn't be the guiding force for how you regulate your biorhythms

216
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,660
Oh, no, because then I would set my thermostat to 420 degrees and burn my family a lot

217
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,560
You're right I've always that always fucks me up yeah, but it would be I would be burning alive but cackling cuz it's like

218
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,480
And then I would be reduced to ash I'm just saying if there's somewhat like a thermostat manufacturer listening

219
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,640
Create a mode where they are. Yeah anywhere between

220
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,520
65 and like 75 no matter where you set it. It still reads as 69

221
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,560
Right. So that way we can still get the effect. Yeah, we still get the joke

222
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,720
You can even put it in quotes on the display 69 right just paint over it

223
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Oh, yeah, and then you don't you're like your body doesn't shit my body definitely my body can tell the difference between 75 and 70

224
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
Do you think if we blindfolded you?

225
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,280
Yeah, I might put earplugs in or something and then we like lowered it or race it by a degree

226
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,560
You'd be like, oh, that's 71

227
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,440
if you said it to say if the thermostat was set to 74 degrees and then you covered my face and

228
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,120
like with a bag with a bag and just like got rid of all senses, but touch right and then

229
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,360
Either lowered or increase the temperature by one degree. I could for sure tell you like which direction

230
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,840
Oh, we're gonna that's not that's yeah, like that's but that doesn't even seem that astonishing to me. That seems like something

231
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
I don't think I'd notice

232
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Okay. All right, but I don't know how to test that

233
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Like we'll raise and lower at me and being like still fine. Yep, doing great

234
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Guys, I worry with all this 69 talk that things have gotten a little pure aisle

235
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,160
So I thought I would like raise the brow a little bit. Oh, man. Oh wait. It's been a really long time

236
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
Do you know what? I mean? Like it's been like a yeah, right? So it's like ready to come back with some work of art

237
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,320
Of all of them of all of them to come back I think this was

238
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,800
Well, it didn't come back Griffin. I just had to think a good one

239
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,760
So it took a little while because street cart named these nuts really took it out of me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

240
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,240
Yeah, so just a reminder how this works. Can I offer one thing just before you move forward? Sure. Sure. Sure

241
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,080
después de todos estos años volver al origen de todo

242
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
volver a matrix

243
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,880
It hits good there too, it hits really good there too

244
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Back in the matrix after all these years

245
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,200
Um, so well just a reminder. This would be I'm going to describe a classic work of art and

246
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,280
Justin and Griffin will just give me the title. It's that simple. So like if I said

247
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,760
Can you believe this is only the third time that Travis is I just googled my bim bam work of art

248
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,120
Which the bim bam wiki describes as Travis modifies the titles of classic books into bathroom jokes

249
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
That's fair, yeah

250
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,920
And it's like it would be like if I said like Sun Tzu's classic guide to fighting a battle and also a little toot slips out

251
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,020
And it would be in the fart of fart of war very short of war

252
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
No, I just said

253
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,120
Beats and thought zebra. Here we go. The first one

254
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,760
Frank L bombs classic story of a quartet attempting to get what they desire

255
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,660
But also the author focuses a lot on how the scarecrow makes semen

256
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
That would be the

257
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,280
This is correct. Okay. Now they're gonna get more difficult as it go on understand though, please understand dear brother

258
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,400
The jizzard is not a word

259
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,800
Please understand dear brother, please understand jizzard is not a word

260
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,920
It is it's the it's a wizard of jizz, okay? Oh

261
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm sure they have

262
00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:02,700
No, Justin at the very least I want to seen the word gizzard and mispronounced it. Okay. Oh do not

263
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Is this your first day on the internet

264
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,000
Now round two. Yeah

265
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
this

266
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,260
Fscot Fitzgerald classic involves Nick

267
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,880
Nick befriending a wealthy bon vivant and man about town who's in love with Daisy and also

268
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,340
Poops himself a lot

269
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,980
Shatsby, I'm sorry. What was that the great shots be that's correct Griffin. Good job

270
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,620
Griffin you're so good at this game. You're really good this game

271
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,940
I wish I could come up with this pure awesome as quickly as you track Griffin. Okay, I got I'm twisted

272
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:49,100
That's one more just more this Charles Dickens classic tells the tale of how Ebenezer Scrooge's life has changed

273
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,900
when a series of ghosts inserts their closed hands into his butthole

274
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,060
Griffin I'm so deeply impressed by how quickly

275
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,820
Not

276
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,700
Difficult, it's not it's a rhyme with the worst word you can think of

277
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,180
Justin was hours behind you on that. I'm still trying to get I still don't get Jessa DeVos

278
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,740
Yeah, but here you are Griffin before I can even finish like oh this is Carol. You were so excited by are you finished?

279
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,780
Are you finished Griffin? Do you want to come up with something? You're so good at this. I

280
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Bet I could but yeah

281
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,740
I really don't want to yeah, maybe on the next oops all bets. Yeah, that'd be great. I would love to do to switch

282
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,420
Well, I mean this is actually a great

283
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,460
I would love a comeuppance here for Travis and I found just the way to do it. Let's approach the jizzers

284
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,660
Nice

285
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,540
This one was sent in by Omni present millipede. Thank you. It's a wiki how article that is

286
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,340
Entitled how to prank your brother. Oh boy, so

287
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,260
Maybe oh, maybe Travis just as I pay back for that

288
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,660
You can do like not you just like step out of the room for a bit and me and Justin complain a big one

289
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,300
Okay, I promise you won't listen. I'm plugging my ears for sure

290
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,340
Juice number one plan a big attack from the closet

291
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,540
This is an absolutely brilliant plan first pick a time when your brother doesn't think you're home and nobody else is there then hide in

292
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,900
A closet maybe your own then quietly call the house from your cell phone and when he answers the phone say you need him to

293
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,340
Go in your closet and then we open to you jump out and go like boo

294
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,180
And then he won't expect to see you there and he will freak out you'll be able to hold this one against him for years

295
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,780
So you wanna try that?

296
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,820
Griffin got fist with Carol right away. Yeah, get in the closet

297
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,900
Travis hey trap. Yeah, I left something I left my I left my backpack for

298
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
school in my closet

299
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,260
Which one is that mine closet get it out of the backpack look like

300
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,100
Purple purpose they have any characters on it or your name or anything. Oh

301
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,940
It's got sewer sharks. Ah sick, bro. Yeah, I'll get it

302

363
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,940
Is this low fat? Fuck you?

364
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,740
It's it's ready with Justin quick. Give him a wedgie

365
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,860
Wait until he turns away from you. Good luck. I'm not wearing underpants. Oh god. No, I keep reaching lower and lower

366
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,820
There's nothing you'll find it. Don't give up. It's in there

367
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,920
Can you scratch right there though while you're there? Oh God Justin just quick. Here's an actual suggestion

368
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Stick paper on his butt

369
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,380
What why well is a quick and easy one you get a piece of paper that's similar color to a surface like a couch or

370
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,700
Chair and then you put glue on it and when he gets up

371
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
He'll be walking around with a piece of paper on his booty

372
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,420
Did they literally stop there? They didn't say like write something on it

373
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,100
Well, they said this is an updated version of the always effective. Kick me sign. So that's not always effective. It's never been effective

374
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,180
Even though I'm somebody put a kick me sign on someone's back the other person who saw I was like, oh, come on

375
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,900
Let me get that for you. There's a whole subcategory called bathroom pranks

376
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,860
But none of them are quite as ribald as you would want them to be. Yeah, so let's jump straight to food pranks

377
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay, do I need to go to sleep again? It doesn't matter you haven't fallen for any easier like neo

378
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,280
Yeah, just always dodging them Justin couldn't make a sponge look like cake

379
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,520
But not an actual but like it's not an edible sponge. I got cleaning one put put chocolate on it

380
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,880
So it's like a cake Travis. Well, I'll just save time. You know what?

381
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,480
I'll just I don't want try to be excellent in the sponge. So I'll just make

382
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,440
Like a sponge cake like a nice. Oh, you know what? Why don't you make a cake look like a sponge? That's really popular

383
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Griffin is that prank?

384
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,600
Mmm, then I go to like clean the dishes and it's like what it was cake Travis drink this milk

385
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,120
No, Travis drink this milk. Well, the human body's not really developed to drink milk Griffin

386
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760

387
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,520

Wait, I have to move this trash can close to you now drink this milk

389
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,680
I'm following this wiki our article Travis and it says to have a trash can close because he might

390
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Vomit

391
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Knowing that Griffin. I'm definitely not gonna drink this milk, but this is regular milk. You're part of the control group

392
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,280
I'm actually gonna prank Justin. Oh, okay

393
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,400
You're drinking it. There's vinegar. I put vinegar in it. I love that

394
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,400
Fuck he liked it. It didn't even work. It's really good for the system. Can we try again?

395
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,000
But I'll put salt and pepper in it, which is okay

396
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,400
That's good

397
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,520

407
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,980

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,840
Oh, then I don't want it Griffin. I'm a married man

409
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah, that's what's fucked up, huh?

Yeah, yeah, so this pretty good pranks. Wait, that's the wait. Hold on Griffin. Yeah

417
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,840
That's it write a fake love letter to someone

418
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Um

419
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,920
Make a fake love letter sign from a girl in his class that he also has the same name girl

420
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,000
In your class and place it in his book bag. He'll find the love letter and either confront the girl or tell his friends

421
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Sooner or later. He'll tell you guys

422
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,240
Tell him that you have a girl that has the same exact name and likes a boy with his name

423
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,240
He'll feel so embarrassed because the girl said she didn't and he told his friends Wow, that's Machiavellian

424
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Ah

425
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Twists and turns either

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,000
Count of Monte Cristo. Wait, hold on guys. Could you explain? Did you prank me or what's happening?

427
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,040
What's your love note from a girl who has the name of the same girl in a class?

428
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,960
I'm in but she likes somebody who has the same name as you but it's not you and you just told your boys you fucking dumb

429
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,000

430
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,840

431
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,440
What a good pranks article. Thanks everybody. Thanks article great a lot of fun and

432
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,500
Think about it that I mean, even if there weren't a lot of laughs. We are that much closer to matrix for

433
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,320
So that you killed a little bit of time that way, you know

434
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Knives out to also

435
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm looking at most anticipated, you know. Yeah, man. Let's take a break

436
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,600
I

437
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
love sheets

438
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,680
Man, I'm not even lying

439
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,640
Like this is not one of those things of like I'm gonna put on airs to be like all sheets

440
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,680
They're the best like I just got a new mattress. And so I was like time to order new sheets

441
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,920
You know, it's been a lot of people challenging you be like, you don't actually like sheets

442
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,640
I was like, you know, sometimes you're like I love sheets and they're like, well you enjoy sheets

443
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. No, I understand love. I need sheets. Yeah, that's why I love Brooklin

444
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,680
Because listen Brooklin and I know what you're saying Travis. You just talked about how much you love sheets

445
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:38,640
We know Brooklin and does great sheets. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. They do now imagine a company with the commitment to detail and comfort

446
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:46,320
That they show to sheets bringing that to lounge wear. I'm afraid to think I'm afraid to imagine

447
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,760
I know I know but let your mind dwell on that for just a moment Griffin because it's true

448
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,600
Because the implications of that are are are profound. Yeah, it's gonna feel like you're wearing

449
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,680
Bedding but in a right way, right? Yeah, and then it's like am I awake? Am I asleep?

450
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,380
Like I don't know. I don't know if I'm awake. Yeah, is this the matrix?

451
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,680
Nobody knows and Brooklin and offers bundle deals on lounge wear so you can get more. Did you say bungle deals bundle?

452
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,080
Mr. Bungle deals. They don't laugh. Hey, hey, don't laugh. I thought that's what you said

453
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,840
But if you bungle the word bundle you get some money off

454
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,680
All right. I mean not everything has to be a joke

455
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,600
And not only that they do candles and I'm asking all kind of accessories to help you. Yeah, I love Brooklin

456
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:44,840
And I've got Brooklyn and sheets. I got Brooklyn and towels and I'm excited to wear Brooklyn and pants

457
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,440
So get comfortable and get it for less at Brooklyn and go to Brooklyn and calm and use promo code my brother all one word

460
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
That's Brooklyn and comm promo code my brother

461
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,280
In the future, we'll all be batteries. And so we got to get off the internet now except for stamps calm

462
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,360
Because with stamps calm you can print official US postage and shipping labels 24-7 without having to leave your desk or buy any kind

463
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
of fancy equipment you just need your

464
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
computer which is

465
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,920
You got to have a pretty strict net nanny on this one just sort of locking you into stamps calm make that your home page

466
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,800
And then throw away the keyboard

467
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,320
and the printer cannot be

468
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,160
Connected to the internet which is tricky. So you got to like

469
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
Put this stuff you want to print the postage on floppy

470
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,960
Disks and then print it out that way but they offer you deals at stamps calm

471
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,120
You can't get anywhere else like up to 40% off USPS and up to 66% off UPS shipping rates

472
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,240
And we got to get back together with this thing

473
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,720
Using this postage that you get off the special offline version of stamps calm that you downloaded

474
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,000

485
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
We have wasted this world

486
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,480
Our magic put a storm in the sky that has rendered the surface of our planet uninhabitable

487
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,760
But beneath the surface. Well, that's another story entirely

488
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:13,840
In a city built leagues below the apocalypse survivors of the storm forged paths through a strange new world

489
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,240
Some seek salvation for their homeland above others seek to chart the vast undersea expanse outside the city's walls

490
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,720
And others still seek what else?

491
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
fortune and glory

492
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:35,440
Dive into the ether see the latest campaign from the adventure zone every other Thursday on maximum fun org or wherever you listen to

493
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
podcasts

494
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,920
It just occurred to me the other day guys that the title of the movie first wives club

495
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,360
And I've never seen it, but it has nothing to do with like the president of the United States

496
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,400
I think right it's like a play on words because they're like the first wives and like they're divorced and now they're second

497
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,140
Oh, that's interesting. I always I also always assumed it was

498
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:05,260
Um press presidential I've never seen it before so that's just my anybody who's seen that indelible film would not make that mistake

499
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,940
So I'm assuming you have this that I know I haven't seen it

500
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,420
I've said several times that I haven't seen I'm learning a lot about movies this episode. That's not gonna stop Griffin

501
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:20,460
Okay, cuz great news finally, we're able to retire much squad. We huh? We hung the jersey up. No more much

502
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,500
No more much squad this week cuz there weren't any good ones

503
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,140
But I did want to take a second to start as a brand new bit for this week only it'll never happen again

504
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,980
All right, it's called master of master of disguise

505
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:40,580
Where there's the film the film master I have to thank Ryan for sending me one of these

506
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,700
One of these reviews of master disguise of which on the service. I am to be there at 24,000 now Justin

507
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,540
Just to be clear. This is master disguise a movie, which I'm going to guess came out in 2000

508
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
very very close

509
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,660
2002 you know how I you know how I know that for a fact why easy way to remember that master is

510
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
2002 is that

511
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,620
The turtle club scene was being filmed on 9-11

512
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,940
Yes, so the when you see the turtle club scene that was being flown on 9-11

513
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,660
So that's one thing you can remember about total a lot of things every time he says turtle. He's thinking about like

514
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,300
The 9-11 is happening take the rest of the day off

515
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,860
Should we stop the rest today and Dana Carvey was like don't or no

516
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:30,900
We look guys if we stop filming master of disguise now the terrorists have won

517
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,700
so

518
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,260
Yeah, so just I'm we're just kind of this is kind of like be more breezy and holistic because I can't read

519
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,500
All these reviews. Here's a one-star one. It's possible

520
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,660
I just want you to know Justin because I want you to understand the weight of the responsibility that you're currently bearing

521
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,540
there's a very good chance that there are

522
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,980
Many many people listening this right now for him this 19 year old movie

523
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,900
This is their first time being aware of it

524
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,060
Probably not the master of this. This is from this is one star from 2020 the master disguise

525
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
This might as well be called how not to make a movie

526
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,620
This film is yet when I say it like that

527
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,040
I'm using air quotes because a lot of people do it

528
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,360
You have to say this film is yet another one of the top ten worst movies. I've ever seen

529
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,360
I remember when this film first came out. I was in elementary school back then

530
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,120
I was kind of interested in seeing it

531
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,200
But I've never got around to almost like you're the target audience at that point or even buying it on video

532
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
Yep, that was still during the VHS transition DVD era

533
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,620
I never saw it was first released and just over ten years later. I saw it on demand for free

534
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,220
So I thought why not? I think I'll give it a watch. Yeah, and

535
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,180
Then the it goes on from there

536
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,420
for pages upon pages upon pages

537
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,540
Here's a they didn't even like the turtle club scene by the way

538
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,580
That sucks one thing to point out

539
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:03,460
The most popular scene is the turtle club scene that supposedly is supposed to be the come comedic highlight

540
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,140
It appeared the most frequent all the commercials and trailers believe me

541
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,700
I know but when I watched it, I was very disappointed big shock

542
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:19,100
It's nothing but Dana Carvey who plays the main character pistachio disguise II know seriously, that's his name

543
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,300
Spoiler before before I tear apart Dana Carvey's performance

544
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:30,000
I just want to say one thing and this person goes on and on and on here's here's um, here's here's a here's a one-star

545
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
from 2005 all

546
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,860
Data what goodness name were you thinking? Oh

547
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
My

548
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Was this a stinker I

549
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,780
Tried to give as much of a chance as possible because you cannot believe everything you read from critics and

550
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:55,300
You cannot believe everything you hear with the master. This guy's everything you taste you can oh, this is awful

551
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,080
I don't really think they meant it to be awful

552
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:05,040
We haven't yet tried to make a movie here at McElroy brothers HQ

553
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,120
But I don't think a lot of you were like, hey, let's really fuck this one up

554
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,680
Oh like in a fun way in like the room or like a bad like the scary movie movies. Nah. Nah. Nah. No, let's just do a

555
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,120
shit job

556
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Man, I know

557
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,720
I don't think they meant it to be awful. I mean the story sounded good

558
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:26,980
I'm sure on paper to a bunch of film executives who are drunk at the time

559
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,200
they heard it then it probably got a

560
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,200
By a bunch of other folks in various forms of development who thought this could really be a silly little film that would catch on

561
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,200
But it wasn't and didn't

562
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,880
In some other universe. I wish there was a better script to punch up the story

563
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,400
But they're relied too much on Dana's characters that were god-awful and unfunny

564
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,320
This movie was painful to watch painful to see talented people on a film in a very untalented movie

565
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,280
Someone should have pulled the plug cease production for a decade

566
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:04,840
Something anything but here we are. This film is a major pass under any circumstance

567
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,200
That's fucking me like they're just being mean

568
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,280
It's this one's this one's just mean and I feel like we should like look like a better one

569
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,520
I also just say that like maybe I don't know if this is the thing that people do

570
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,360
But maybe we like the three of us could do a punch-up pass on it now post-production

571
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,000
Post-production way post written 19 years post-production 19 years later. We could do our own

572
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,320
That's something to think about let's put that on the sticker board while I read this one from Jerome

573
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,360
But this is from 2004 the best impression ever ten out of ten stars. Nice. All right good. Come on guys

574
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:42,120
This movie's great. It has about a dozen moments that would make you laugh to death. That's not a lot. Holy shit

575
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
Holy fuck Wow

576
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Oh

577
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Like he always dreams

578
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,280
Then Carvey's a fantastic comedian

579
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,380
He does a lot of impressions in the picture that make the movie worth a of a higher grade about a seven

580
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,440
I'd say now this is from person who did just give it ten out of ten stars

581
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,360
So maybe they're just trying to write the ship a little bit cool and the scene from Jaws

582
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,000
Almost made me wait what holy shit. They just cut a scene from Jaws

583
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,120
I've never seen this movie, but I didn't know you could just do that

584
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,900
Also the actress that shares the screen with Dana Carvey as well as Brent mr. Data spider

585
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:29,960
Made a good supporting career that way you couldn't go ahead and find out her name their reviewer the actress that's really green

586
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,840
And now yeah, you're you're hey you're on IMDB right now. I know it

587
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,540
I believe most people thought this should be a more serious comedy

588
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,440
Wait more intellectual what but no, it's just simple and good jokes

589
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,680
Come on. You guys should evaluate this movie better funny

590
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,680
Very funny movie. Okay, cool. Hey, I have a

591
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,880
Widescreen monitor and I have to as I want to do when I'm cruising the net

592
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,160
I have it split in half where one half is one

593
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,280
Google Chrome window and the other half is the as another Google Chrome window

594
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:16,760
And but I have just sort of absentmindedly I now have the Wikipedia page for the Master of Disguise open on both halves

595
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,760
You just

596
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:28,400
Two of them can I read the last line and about the post-credits scene in Master of Disguise, it's good spoilers everyone

597
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,840
Oh, yeah, there's by the way master disguise. There's three

598
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,200
Awesome three post-credits. That's good. Well, here's one of them a spoiler skip ahead 30 seconds

599
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,520
If you don't want to I'm just gonna read it verbatim in a post-credits scene

600
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,320
Pistachio discovers that the slappy dummy which he used earlier in the film has a little man inside

601
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,680
They proceed to chase and slap each other but later share a drink together before saying goodbye to the audience

602
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
Sounds like a good film I'd like to see

603
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,320
All right. All right good bit over 50 thought it was super funny

604
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,640
Dan and Carvey is brilliant see him as a turtle and try not to laugh

605
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:15,680
He does Al Pacino as a Saturday Night Fever dancer who flips all over the other crowd cannot understand this movie

606
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,080
But we thought it was hilarious. That's awesome. Do you think he was still chant like riding that 9-eleven way?

607
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,200
But they recorded that scene too. Do you think he used it?

608
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,800
Part of it. I wonder if they took a break for a few hours. I

609
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,280
Mean they they had they shot this thing in like a three-week shoot like it was tight

610
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,400
So like they did not have time to really process

611
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
What had happened?

612
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,040
So he had to use it, you know, what other choice did he have?

613
00:49:43,040 --> 00:50:06,720
That's a good bit there's no cursing by the way awesome you didn't ask I just got slapped in the fucking face

614
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
I'm a turtle

615
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,080
So, yeah

616
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,600
No

617
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,500
It's also because it is also easy to remember what year

618
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,880
anniversary you are in with the master of skies like I know without you thinking about this is the 20th anniversary of

619
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,960
Master of the skies being released in theaters. Hmm, like today

620
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,600
Not the best definitely not the worst. Okay

621
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:38,920
Um, should we do at least one more question you think? Yeah. Cool. Yep. Yep. Is it sort of master disguise theme? Yeah

622
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,840
All right, I'm ready then

623
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,480
I'm a nanny for a nine-year-old who was just going back to school

624
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,400
Last year the bus driver called me by my college's name as a nickname. Hey

625
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
insert school name here

626
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,280
But I have since graduated and grab the this year the bus driver has taken just called me the graduate

627
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,760
Which is significantly worse in my opinion. How do I get this nine-year-olds bus driver to give me a cooler nickname?

628
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,880
That's from vexed in Virginia. That's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. That kicks ass the graduate

629
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,680
Are you fucking kidding me? I would give anything if you are a highly paid assassin the graduate be an amazing. Oh, yeah

630
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,800
Oh, you don't want to be the graduate is after you. Oh, you're fucked here come here comes

631
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,880
But they bail obviously based this on you were wearing a shirt or something with your costume

632
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,180
A shirt or something with your college's name on it?

633
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:35,280
Like that's where this came out of so like be grateful that they got there with such little information, right?

634
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,220
Yeah, because they wouldn't just be like, oh here comes the sandwich eater because they saw you

635
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,480
Yeah, they were like, oh here comes mr. Dooley's clown college for sinners. Yeah

636
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Now you're the graduate

637
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,400
That's great, man. The problem is the bus driver doesn't have more information about you

638
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,680
You should just start giving that bus driver more information about you. Oh, yes all your information social security

639
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,920
address

640
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,560
Give them all your needs. He's just trying this is a new way people have it's a new phishing scam

641
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,660
Right where the the Fisher makes you want to give them your personal information. Yeah, you could be

642
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,420
Oh, here comes fucking point dexter glasses neater

643
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,360
Cuz you were got it because you are you wear glasses and I assume you need them

644
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:27,160
That's all I know about you point dexter glasses neater. Here's what I know about the school bus. Yeah

645
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,040
They there they have two jobs one

646
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,520
safely ferry children from corners to school

647
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,000
Second try to lure adults onto the bus, huh? Because it's so embarrassing

648
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,320
Oh, I see. It's like you basically get like 20 points for every adult that you can lure on the way. What do you do?

649
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,600
Oh, what fuck yeah headed downtown hop aboard just kidding more

650
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,760
This is a regular bus and by the time you're like already walking up the steps like wait a minute

651
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:02,320
This seems like it's full of kids. Whoa, and you're already halfway to school if they bring you to the the bus depot

652
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,200
Then they get 20 points for every adult that they've ordered the bus and you have to walk home

653
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,160
They'll know if you try to get an uber don't you have to start school over from whatever

654
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,800
Is like the youngest grade of the school that they brought subjects of Billy Madison

655
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,760
Do you got do you guys ever wonder cuz bus drivers the school bus drivers?

656
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,840
They pick up the kids in the morning drop the kids off at school

657
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,920
Then they pick up the kids at school and they drop the kids off at home

658
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,960
Yeah, you summed it up pretty well. What's that window in between?

659
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,280
What about school bus drivers doing? Well Travis they're training and I know what you're wondering for what?

660
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,760
On ways to lure more

661
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,920
Their passion they do it for the love of the game. You know what I mean?

662
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,480
I think that there should be like a school bus right between the hours of let's say like 9 and 2

663
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:59,160
They can give rides to adults right and the end no penalty there, right? That's fine. Oh, whoa

664
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:07,640
What if there was a different like Lyft and uber but it was only between like 830 and 230, uh-huh

665
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:15,040
I call a bus like a bus and you like roll up and it's like yeah

666
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,440
This is my web. It's a school. We just saved a lot of musical programs in elementary school

667
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,240
Yeah, oh man. It says there's a fucking 13-minute wait for an uber. We're gonna we're gonna miss our flight

668
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,040

4.9 star rating on did you say you got a bus? No, no, no the app is called boosts

Yeah, man. Yeah, that's pretty. It's a cool service that we provide here on boosts

684
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,880
Don't put that in the app. It's kind of like an off-label

685
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,500
One of the actual review options is let me drove drive the bus

686
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,400
They did let me drive the bus and if you pick that I do get fired immediately

687
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,760
So don't it's a trap. That's a trap review option. So please don't you have to pay an extra five bucks to smoke in the back?

688
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Yeah
