1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. We're welcoming back

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,880
international advice correspondent Griffin McElroy from the-

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,240
Guten Morgen!

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,280
From the shining, the sandy shores of Germany.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,120
Beach, beachy-

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
My, my name is Griffin.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,160
Wow.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,160
That's, they don't say my over there, they say mine. It's like the most confusing thing

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,720
about their language and culture, other than everything.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,880
Some of the, now Griffin, did you enjoy any international cuisine?

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
I ate, I ate literally the same kind of schnitzel two days in a row.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,040
Okay.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,440
That's sort of my, my steez when it comes to international travel. Keep in mind,

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,480
this is the first time that I've done it. So I was really sort of setting the boundaries for

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,000
myself, but I ate schnitzel with mushroom sauce and french fries on it. And then I,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,120
second night, like night right after that, I was like, yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and have

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,680
that same thing.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Now, Griffin, you didn't drink the water over there, did you?

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
They don't have the water, actually.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,360
They don't have any water.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
It's, it's all distilled locker.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,280
It's like Dubai over there. It's pretty crazy. Now, Griffin, many people on this podcast think

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
that schnitzel is like a crepe or burrito because they're-

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
You're an idiot if you think that. If you think it's a sausage-

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
I know it's like a breaded, like a pork chop.

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,560
I literally had to tell Travis what it was right before we started this call.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Damn it, Griffin, you weren't supposed to tell him.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
I don't know. I still don't know. You haven't cleared it up for me at all.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,320
It's like a pork chop. It's like a fried, it's like a fried, uh, it's like a, you know how,

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,600
uh, you remember when you were a kid and you got, um-

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,160
Funnel cake.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,240
Those, no, no, no. You got those, uh, you got those lollipops that were,

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,160
you got those lollipops that were also whistles.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,360
Yeah.

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
It's nothing. It's nothing like that.

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920
Nothing like that. Okay.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
You guys remember Nickel Maid?

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,680
Yeah.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Look, my, it's not like that either. So let's just process of elimination,

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
talk about what schnitzel is and is not.

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,480
Okay.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,320
In fact, if you could just go through everything that schnitzel is not.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
Okay. Let's see.

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,160
Welcome.

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
Taco Bell, anything on the Taco Bell menu.

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
Pizza, uh, hamburgers.

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
No, these are just food items. You really need to branch out to other things schnitzel isn't.

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,080
Oh, you're right. Uh, frisbees, uh, lamp posts, uh, adoption papers.

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,320
Are there any, is anything at McDonald's similar to schnitzel?

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,280
Let me think, uh, chicken nuggets. I think if you took out the chicken,

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,320
although there is chicken schnitzel and then you flatten that shit down and then you made

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
a germiner.

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
Yeah. Did the McDonald's in Germany, did they have mixed schnitzel?

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Uh, they do only in Dusseldorf.

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,200
Something, something royale with cheese.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
I had, I had the pleasure of enjoying that when I was in Dusseldorf,

63
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,600
which did you guys know Dusseldorf is German for out of here Jews.

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
Hold on now. One second. That's not accurate. Is it?

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
It is.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,800
I do not do is the German root for Jew.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,560
And then, uh, Seldorf is come on, get on out.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,600
Scoot. Hey, why don't you scoot?

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,160
So that's the actual official translation. I learned a lot about, um, by the way,

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Germans, I'm sorry about that thing.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,640
I said, you, your, your country is beautiful and your people are very efficient.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Can I ask you a serious, not joking question now?

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
How many dudes did you see wearing lederhosen?

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,760
Yeah.

76
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
There had to be please tell me there was at least one dude.

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,480
Here's the thing. I went there for a game convention.

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,680
So I did see a bunch of utility kilts, which is like the modern day hosen.

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,720
I feel like this is our, uh, advice, podcasts and international bridge building.

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Audio seminar, I think is where it's a sort of a cultural, cultural, uh, buffet.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
I would say I'm off to Mexico next tomorrow leaving for that.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
And I'm trying to drink all the water down there.

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
Right, right. You're supposed to just gulp it in big heady gulps.

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,920
And, um, uh, cause then it just inoculates you so fast is what I've heard.

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,600
I read it on TripAdvisor. They said, just dip your head under the water and just

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
breathe it deep for a few, for a few minutes.

87
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
Now, Travis, I do notice Travis that you just said it inaugurates you.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
You become the president of Mexico when you drink the water.

89
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,520
Okay.

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
It changes hands quite often.

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Also, I, I read on, uh, on Yahoo Answers funnily enough that, uh, it makes you poop to death.

92
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,760
So that is another consideration.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,920
So that is, that's going to be a lot of fun.

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Absent presidents is a big problem.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
It's going to be a fun week. Great vacation.

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
Uh, lose 20 pounds in poop weight.

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
I recently defended my dissertation and as such can be called doctor.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,800
While I've been looking forward to this, I now find it a bit awkward.

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,760
When is it appropriate to introduce myself with or purposefully use my freshly minted title?

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,480
And that's from newly doctoral in New Orleans.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
Always.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,440
Never.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,640
Sometimes.

104
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Okay.

105
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,360
Well, I, I wonder like, is the, I imagine if I had like a PhD doctorate versus like an MD doctorate,

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
it's probably really embarrassing when they're like, I'm a doctor and like,

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
oh, what's your specialty?

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
And you're like, my history.

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,480
Yeah.

110
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Well, I don't think that's embarrassed.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,680
I don't think that being so goddamn smart that you could go to the hardest school.

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
What if some, what if some dude has a heart attack over in the corner and they're like,

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
is there a doctor in the house?

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,200
You're like, I'm a doctor.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,320
And they're like, save him.

116
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,920
Like, but you wouldn't, but I'll write a real epic essay about him afterwards.

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
First off, back up.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Why the fuck if you had a doctor in history, would you be like, oh yeah, I got, oh, you mean like a,

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,640
like a doctor.

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,000
You thought that somebody was like, I need somebody to volunteer their immense knowledge

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
of history at this.

122
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm just saying that they weren't specific.

123
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,280
Nobody clarified.

124
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,760
Nobody said, is there a medical doctor in the house?

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Sure.

126
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,880
Sure.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,920
Well, at least if you're a doctor of history, after the person dies, you can tell everybody

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
how it went down.

129
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
Like you couldn't save him, but it was a beautiful eulogy.

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,520
Oh yeah.

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
Mark was a, Mark was a good man.

132
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
He was a truck driver.

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
Do you want to know about trucks?

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
This is history.

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
The truck was invented by Sterling.

136
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm a doctor of truckology.

137
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
It was invented by Sterling Truckster.

138
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Trucks, trucks are big cars.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
A misconception held by many.

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,400
A car is like a horse with wheels that a man put together.

141
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,640
Can I be a doctor of patronizing?

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,320
Can I be a doctor of condescending paternalism?

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
I think, okay.

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
My wife is a doctor.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,680
And when I sign us into guest books, I sign it as doctors, Justin and Sidney McElroy.

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Because that's, that's, that doesn't work.

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,240
Now see, I'm just rounding up.

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,680
The majority of us are doctors in our family.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
Now, now you know that it's not like you don't share like that, like a bank account.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,640
Like when you get married, you don't confer a title upon the other.

151
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,640
Let me ask you, let me ask you this.

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,200
When you, when you have a baby and you take, you take the child to the wedding,

153
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,320
is the child temporarily a doctor for all intents and purposes?

154
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,880
Oh, Griffin, we wouldn't take the child to the wedding.

155
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay. I mean, what if there's a ball pit?

156
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
How long does this go?

157
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,560
You, you have two cats now.

158
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
Are they doctors as well?

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Uh, they're cats.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,920
So they, they work in a pharmacy.

161
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,600
I always forget, I forget because cats are like just a perfect little ball of sunshine

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,880
that they bring like the only happiness into my life that there is.

163
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Right.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
I forget, I forget they're people, I guess is what I mean.

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Oh yeah.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,840
I mean, cats are basically people that crawl around like the girl in the ring.

167
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,280
But other than that, don't, don't ever.

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,560
The grudge, the grudge.

169
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,360
Sorry, not the ring.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
There's also a crawling girl.

171
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,960
Is there a way to like correct?

172
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:49,200
So just don't when someone's like, ah, Mr. McElroy, like to say, uh, it's Dr. McElroy.

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,920
Nice to meet you.

174
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,240
The only time that that ever happened to me was in college, which was always a crapshoot.

175
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
Cause you don't know if your professor is a doctor or not,

176
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
unless you're paying very close attention,

177
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
which you probably aren't cause you're in college.

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,880
You're too busy trying to, you know, chase skirts anyway.

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,680
Yeah.

180
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,240
So you'd be like, hello, professor Morgan.

181
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
And it's a doctor.

182
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
And then they'll correct you.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
And it's also a captain.

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,680
I think that's the only, I think that's the only circumstance where it's appropriate.

185
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Otherwise just fucking let it fly or else things are going to get weird.

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah.

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Just like drop doctor on them.

188
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,320
Just no, just don't just leave the doctor out of it.

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Say my name is doctor.

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm the doctor.

191
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Do you think Superman walked around like, hello?

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
So he's got some superpowers over here.

193
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
So don't worry about those.

194
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
What do you need?

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
Something lifted later.

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,680
Cause I can.

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,240
Here's what you do.

198
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
You go to him and say, hi, just, just simple.

199
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
Just hi, my name's Dan.

200
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,240
And they say, oh, that then they assume that must be your name.

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
And then you say, actually it's Michael.

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm a doctor of mind freak of mind freak them.

203
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
So just use a different first name.

204
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Now doctor of mind freak is that.

205
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
Is that a four year program?

206
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
What can you tell me about getting your doc?

207
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Cause I've been thinking about going back to school lately.

208
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm just having a hard time nailing down a concentration.

209
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,320
It's actually pretty, if you go to ride aid or any other drug store and you see one of

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,480
those like 120 magic tricks in a box, if you buy it and can master all of the tricks,

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
then Chris angel comes to your house with Harry Blackwell, Blackstone.

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Fuck.

213
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't know.

214
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,920
Damn it.

215
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,800
You know, one of them street musicians, magicians.

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh my God.

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,440
Keep it going.

218
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
I need a doctor of strokes.

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
Cause we're having a stroke.

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
I need a doctor of that.

221
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,600
It's like jazz, but jazz is being made by like a middle school jazz band.

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:47,920
Right.

223
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,560
It's like jazz that you squeeze fruits to get.

224
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
Ah, that's juice.

225
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,920
Man, I am just having a rough, rough day.

226
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,120
It's like when you touch your, it's like when you touch your wormy and jazz comes out.

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,520
No, wait.

228
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
Ah, fuck, crap.

229
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
It was a classy episode.

230
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,440
That's sin.

231
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,720
You're thinking of, you're thinking of sin.

232
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Please.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,240
Yes.

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
This is Jermaine.

236
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
It was sent in by Teja or perhaps Teja or Tejay.

237
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Thank you.

238
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sammy, who asks,

239
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,040
is it safe to use maple syrup as lube on my condom?

240
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, well, I bought a bunch of condoms and it seems they aren't lubed at all.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
And really the only thing I can find around the house that could make a good lube is this syrup.

242
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Are there any harmful effects to this?

243
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
Well, there's bears.

244
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,840
There is bears.

245
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,040
You do run the chance that it will harden.

246
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,640
It will harden and then in a million years someone will be trying to make a sort of-

247
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
John Hammond will make-

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
John Hammond will make a park retreat for dumbasses.

249
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,520
Come see the fucking dumbest people.

250
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,920
They're like dumb, dumbass cavemen that got their wieners preserved in sweet, sweet amber.

251
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,320
Let's address the fact that whenever you eat waffles or pancakes or anything syruped

252
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,400
and you get that syrup on anything except for inside of your mouth,

253
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
the syrup is all that you can smell for the rest of-

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
until you just bleach the whole house.

255
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,080
Do you guys remember waffle crisp?

256
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
That shit was like changing your pheromones to waffles for eight days.

257
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,000
It was like it had DNA strands in it that adhered to your own

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
and made you produce syrup from all your glands.

259
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
Well, the dinosaurs have gaps in their DNA.

260
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,440
It's okay.

261
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
We replace it with syrup.

262
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
We put syrup DNA.

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,720
Holy shit.

264
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
The syrup can change genders.

265
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
Syrup finds a way.

266
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
Syrup finds a way, you guys.

267
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah, that's gonna be a huge-

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
Baby, it looks like tonight we're having a threesome.

269
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
You, me, and Aunt Jemima.

270
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
Okay.

271
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
Now just picture it.

272
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
Well, I can't.

273
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,200
You burn my cortex.

274
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
Here's the thing.

275
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,960
Okay.

276
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,040
When my- when my whole coffee table smells like syrup,

277
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
it's upsetting because I don't want it to.

278
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
But what if the- would that be so bad for a gin-gine?

279
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,720
Here's another-

280
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,520
Wait, for a what?

281
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,560
Wait, for a what?

282
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
For a gin-gine.

283
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
A gin-gine?

284
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Okay.

285
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
You make it sound like a Star Wars character.

286
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

287
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

288
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm gonna pretend that's German.

289
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
It is.

290
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,200
It's some slang you brought back with you.

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,440
The three words that I knew were

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Guten Morgen, which was good morning

293
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
because the hotel clerk told me to do it all the time.

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Frühstück, which is breakfast,

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,520
and also because we work with a guy

296
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,880
whose last name is Frühstück.

297
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
You're trying to convince us that every time

298
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
you eat breakfast in Germany, he gets a cut off the top.

299
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
And then also gin-gine, because I actually,

300
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm gonna be honest, I looked that one up.

301
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
That one is-

302
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,520
Did a little Google, or actually over there

303
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,320
they call it something really funny.

304
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,280
My main concern, aside from its lubic properties,

305
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,120
my main concern is that it does not in any way

306
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
impact the prophylactic qualities of this condom

307
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
because from what I know of this individual,

308
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,960
it is essential that he does not reproduce.

309
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,320
It is more important to me than my next breath

310
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,960
that there not be a junior ever attached

311
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,080
to this gentleman's name.

312
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,040
I cannot have him continue this lineage.

313
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,160
Let's all address, the lube typically,

314
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
not very viscous.

315
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Whenever you're trying to do some stuff down there,

316
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,280
you don't usually go, yeah, I really wanna get it

317
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,480
super sticky, like that.

318
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,840
I just wanna gum it up.

319
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,000
I wanna gum it up like Elmer's school glue.

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,040
This is gonna feel great.

321
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,840
It is going to, it will be a lot of tearing.

322
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
The image I can't get out of my head is,

323
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
after I eat pancakes or waffles,

324
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
and I sit down for lunch or dinner,

325
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
and there's a little bit of syrup on the table I missed,

326
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
and it's the worst feeling ever to sit your arm down on it

327
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,080
and be like, oh, oh, sticky here.

328
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Hey, Trav.

329
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,640
And that's full body terrible.

330
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,760
Trav, I like hyperbole as much as the next guy,

331
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,840
but how is your reality that that is the worst thing ever?

332
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,000
That is the worst.

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Have you, how many ever, like, do you know what ever is?

334
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,560
Is this your first day ever?

335
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,360
I do.

336
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Do you never sit there and go,

337
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,080
where did this sticky come from?

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,000
And for half a second, you can't remember?

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,320
But the worst, Trav, it's the worst.

340
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
Are you like Jack?

341
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,160
Have you really only been alive for 16 days

342
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
and you're just aging rapidly?

343
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
No, Justin, I'm sorry.

344
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,280
I have a low tolerance for horrible things.

345
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Apparently you've just been decent,

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
you've been oversensitized to horrible things.

347
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
I have been, Justin.

348
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,080
If that rates up there, getting a sweet elbow,

349
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,320
rates up there on like the worst things

350
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
that have ever happened to you.

351
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,080
A sweet elbow.

352
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,720
That sounds like a sex thing.

353
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Yeah, they gave me a sticky bow.

354
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,780
Yeah.

355
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh man, I hate this dumb show.

356
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,040
I, man, don't do this.

357
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,840
You listening?

358
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,480
You out there?

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,760
You tuned in?

360
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,920
How about you say, baby, looks like we don't have any lube,

361
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,280
but I made you some pancakes.

362
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,680
You don't have to get your rocks off

363
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,880
by ram jamming with some K-Row.

364
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,800
Like if that's the option, I think you opt out.

365
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
And I think you go the pancake route.

366
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,600
I think you get some hungry Jack

367
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
and you mix it with milk and eggs and oil

368
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
and all of a sudden you have a breakfast time.

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
Okay, listen, I don't wanna make too many presumptions,

370
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,960
but is there, does the question indicate at all

371
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,200
that there is a girl involved in this equation

372
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,560
and or another person really for that matter?

373
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,560
Well, there's condoms and I don't understand the science of,

374
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,920
I don't understand what is the process there.

375
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Well, it lets you give yourself a familiar stranger.

376
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
I mean, if you've got the condom on there,

377
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
if that's your concern.

378
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
And then if you put syrup in it,

379
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,600
all of a sudden it's a sticky, whodunit.

380
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,640
Now, Justin, what is a familiar stranger?

381
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,440
Now, a familiar stranger, of course, is when you-

382
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
Is when you stare across the room going,

383
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
I swear, I know that guy.

384
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah, that's exactly it.

385
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,320
But in sex terms, it's when you put on a condom and masturbate

386
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,040
because it's like, this feels so familiar.

387
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
Where do we know you from?

388
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,880
Where do I know this from?

389
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,000
I can almost swear I know this exact jerk off,

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,680
but I don't, oh, I cannot place it.

391
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
Tip of my tongue.

392
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,880
Is this a biz opportunity that we're just,

393
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,840
is this a biz op that we're just watching fly right by?

394
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Is this a market that needs cornered?

395
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,680
What market is that?

396
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,360
Like Uncle Lumberjack's maple condoms, maple prophylactics.

397
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,800
Uncle Lumberjack in it.

398
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,080
I would say that if I'm all for the environment,

399
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
and if we can make our products,

400
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,560
which are served in like a plastic container,

401
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,280
if we can make them do double duty,

402
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
I mean, I guess what I'm saying is,

403
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
currently maple syrup isn't formulated

404
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
to be used as a sex lube.

405
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah, well, we don't know that.

406
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
Sorry, sorry, real quick.

407
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
We don't know that for sure, but go on.

408
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
But yeah, right.

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
But I'm sure there could be a formulation

410
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,240
to where you wouldn't need to have

411
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
both of these products in your home.

412
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,280
Yeah.

413
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,000
You know, I mean, they could, chemically speaking,

414
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
I don't think this is,

415
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
I mean, you might not get as smooth of a pour

416
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,320
over your hot cakes, over your Johnny cakes.

417
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
It seems like once again,

418
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
we've reached a point where we need to leave it

419
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
in the hands of science.

420
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,920
Yeah.

421
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,800
How about it, science?

422
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,960
But I wanna also leave it in the hands of industry,

423
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,800
and I think we could be that industry

424
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
if we somehow trademark these.

425
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm thinking SAP caps, I think is what we call them.

426
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
Okay, SAP caps.

427
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
You can go to ExtremeStraightStock, huh?

428
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,120
Get yourself some SAP caps.

429
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,160
Get on the ground floor.

430
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
Yeah, invest in SAP caps now.

431
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
It's a blue chip stock.

432
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
It's a blue chip stock, by which I mean,

433
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
it's an oo chip stock.

434
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
It's a goo chip stock.

435
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,800
And you can get this goo chip stock, right?

436
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,840
Another for goo chip?

437
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,640
Okay, because it-

438
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,840
Don't put things on your penis that weren't designed.

439
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
Here's a good rule of thumb.

440
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,840
Look at the box.

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,440
Does it say, this is for your penis?

442
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
If no, turn to page 38, and then flip, flip, flip, flip.

443
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't put that on your cock.

444
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,360
Stop it.

445
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,040
Or your vagina, or your gin gin.

446
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,440
No way.

447
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
God damn.

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
Or your gin gin bangs.

449
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
I hate you guys.

450
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
Hey, I'm currently shopping for a new car,

451
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,160
and I'm hoping you can give me some,

452
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
help me logic something out.

453
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm wondering if it's better to dress nicely,

454
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,720
you know, tweed shirt and monocle,

455
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
or dress like a hobo,

456
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
preferably with bendel stick.

457
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Do you think it matters whether the dealer thinks

458
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
I have money to burn, or I'm counting my pennies?

459
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
Thanks, brothers.

460
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
It's from Miss Peanut.

461
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
Ooh, ooh.

462
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Gotta use my, use my noodle.

463
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,240
I think the ideal situation, if I were to guess,

464
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,360
would be, would be up and coming hobo.

465
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,880
Like, hobo with possibilities, you know?

466
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
See, I was thinking like, hobo, but with exemplary credit.

467
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
Well, I want someone who says you're poor now,

468
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
but you seem to be on an uptick.

469
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
So next time you need a motor vehicle,

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,240
you're gonna remember Sim Freis and Honda Nissan,

471
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
and you're gonna come back through these doors,

472
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
because I gave you a sick deal

473
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,720
when you could barely scrape two wooden hobo nickels together.

474
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
I like that.

475
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,680
It's like the two baseball players that make it to first base

476
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,240
at the same time.

477
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,360
Which one do you take?

478
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
You take the less experienced one,

479
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
because you can train him up.

480
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,840
You want to take this hobo as a potential car buyer,

481
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,040
because yeah, he doesn't have the tweed skirt and monocle

482
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,120
of Mrs. Employed, I guess would be the surname.

483
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
But he's got heart.

484
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,120
He's got spirit, you know?

485
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,840
Doesn't have a cash flow to speak of,

486
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,880
but there could be someday.

487
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,000
He's got spunk.

488
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
You want to get him behind the wheel

489
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
of this new Honda Civic 2 Day.

490
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
You want him to drive it off the lot,

491
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,800
so when he comes back,

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,680
you know, after he,

493
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,000
much like the hobo in the hit film UHF

494
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
that gets an exceptionally rare coin

495
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,080
and then sells it for this neat watch,

496
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
you could be that neat watch dealer.

497
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,640
Thanks, mister.

498
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,680
Thanks, mister.

499
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I got this neat watch.

500
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,120
Hey, let's just spend the rest of the show

501
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
doing impressions from UHF.

502
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
Don't call me Mr. Butterfingers.

503
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,520
Supplies.

504
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,240
Red snapper, very tasty.

505
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Don't you know the do it decimal sees top?

506
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,840
That's a best one.

507
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
You should go in to look for a car

508
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
just doing impressions from UHF.

509
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,120
And now Michael Richards,

510
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,920
the sweetly retarded janitor from UHF.

511
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
Can we just do a quick,

512
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,160
let me load up Wikipedia

513
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,360
and read word for word the entire synopsis four times.

514
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
Four times in a row?

515
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,760
You think four times should be enough?

516
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, and then, no, no, no.

517
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,040
Tell you what, read it four times

518
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,400
and then when I'm editing,

519
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,040
I'll just copy and paste until it's 16.

520
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,120
I got you.

521
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,920
I got you.

522
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,760
So I think you got it.

523
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,800
I think you can mix and match.

524
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,840
I think you can put on,

525
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
I think you can put on like a Tweety Bird,

526
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,320
a Tweety Bird sweatshirt, maybe.

527
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
And like a Tweed,

528
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
like a Tweed skirt and Tweed shirt.

529
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,600
Or a sensible skirt

530
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
and a Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

531
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,800
So you sit down at the desk and he's like,

532
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,760
ah, you know,

533
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,160
I'm not gonna drive too hard a deal here

534
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,040
because you obviously are not a woman of means.

535
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,560
And then you get that sweet deal

536
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
and you stand up and he sees,

537
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,800
what's that?

538
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,000
Gucci pants.

539
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
And then he knows,

540
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,000
he knows you got it.

541
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
A Gucci sweatshirt suit, damn.

542
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
Yeah, he actually stands up

543
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
and there's a Gucci tag on the Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

544
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,040
And you're like, oh, you didn't know?

545
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,720
This is from their Tweety line.

546
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,920
Sylvester's on the back

547
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,360
and he's wearing sunglasses.

548
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
And he's got his arms crossed like Marky Mark.

549
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
You can accomplish a lot of this

550
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,800
when as you're buying the car,

551
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,240
you say, well, as I'm picking out options here,

552
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,160
can you show me the binder you have

553
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,280
of Calvin peeing on different things

554
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
that you can affix to the rear windshield?

555
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Because that should,

556
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
I believe that comes standard

557
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,760
on the vehicles you sell here.

558
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
Ask when you take it out for a test drive,

559
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
ask if you can put your,

560
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,680
just horse and around bumper sticker on there

561
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
as part of the test drive

562
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
to really get the feel for it.

563
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,680
I saw a car today with a bumper sticker

564
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,520
and it was a paw print and it said,

565
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,040
fur kids on board.

566
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
So make sure you put that on there too.

567
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
So he knows exactly.

568
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Now, is that saying that bumper sticker

569
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,600
was for the kids who are on board

570
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
or that there were four kids?

571
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,680
No, fur, fur, F-U-R kids.

572
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
They're fur kids.

573
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,600
No, no, no, I heard-

574
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
Like dog babies.

575
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,600
Oh, fuck.

576
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,760
These are my fur kids.

577
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
That's awful.

578
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
That presents a-

579
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,080
These are my fur kids, they're on board.

580
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,160
That presents a real temptation

581
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,640
to just lean into the gas and hope for the best.

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
Sorry about your fur kids.

583
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
And also, I don't want to call this lady a liar.

584
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,680
I looked in her car, I did not see any dogs.

585
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,240
Okay.

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
Right, it's just, it's their ghosts.

587
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,040
Yeah, she just wanted to use the carpool lane, I guess.

588
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
In much the same way that a baby on board sign

589
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,920
does not keep me,

590
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,120
is not the binding social contract

591
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,280
that keeps me from colliding into people.

592
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
I do think I would be so distracted

593
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
and just sort of chagrined by someone

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,800
who referred to animals as their fur kids

595
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
that I might actually be tempted to take them out.

596
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,080
If not take them out, at least cut them off.

597
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,360
Is this a popular car buying strategy

598
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
to be so insufferable

599
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
that the salesman just doesn't want to be around you anymore?

600
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,320
But he also wants to make the sale.

601
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
So you could talk about your fur kids

602
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
with your Tweety Bird sweatshirt.

603
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,600
While you're explaining the plot of UHS.

604
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,680
Uh-huh, do these three things.

605
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,880
If you could smell a lot like syrup,

606
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,280
like overwhelmingly,

607
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,440
if you could even have maybe a little bit in your hair,

608
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,840
then I think that this person would,

609
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,120
you know, still want to get that sale,

610
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,000
you know, still want to get that commish,

611
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,160
but also just generally,

612
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,080
like really not want to be in your presence.

613
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,040
Here's some car buying strategy I learned.

614
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
I found a car that I liked

615
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,760
and, but I didn't buy it as soon as I found it.

616
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,040
And the guy's like,

617
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,640
I got some males coming to look at it.

618
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
And I was like, oh man, I'm not falling for that one.

619
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,160
You know, this isn't my first time with the Rodeo.

620
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,080
And then the next day I came back

621
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,200
and someone else bought it.

622
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
So I just bought the next car he showed me

623
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,800
because I didn't, I couldn't go through that again.

624
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
It was out of his hands, you know?

625
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
I just couldn't go through it.

626
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,080
So that would be my advice is basically,

627
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,160
don't fall in love

628
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,240
because there's always going to be other cars

629
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
and you may just be tired of looking at cars.

630
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
I know, I got there.

631
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,960
How about another Yahoo?

632
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
Yeah, treat me to it.

633
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,720
This one was sent in by Lisa Holyfield.

634
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
Thank you, Lisa.

635
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bryce, who asks,

636
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,440
I want to start a gang.

637
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,480
How is that done?

638
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
The title pretty much says it all.

639
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,320
Now this isn't any gangster with my pants

640
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,920
around my knees kind of gang.

641
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,320
I want this to be like a 1940s gang.

642
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,920
It needs to have more class than quote busting caps.

643
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
If you catch my drift.

644
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Oh my God.

645
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm a huge racist.

646
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,880
Yeah, hey man, you already got a gang.

647
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,240
They're called neo-Nazis.

648
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
Just go fucking sign up.

649
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,280
God damn it.

650
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm gonna be honest with you guys though.

651
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
I would love to be in this gang.

652
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll judge.

653
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,560
No, I know, I know, I know.

654
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,680
Just to listen to this guy come up with plans for our gang.

655
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Our gang to get into.

656
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,280
Yeah.

657
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,440
What kind of shenanigans we're gonna get into.

658
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I haven't read all the laws that there are.

659
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Can you just walk down the street yelling,

660
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,160
hey, who wants to start a gang with me?

661
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,760
Who wants to be a part of the demon racers?

662
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,440
Yeah, is that gonna be a legal problem?

663
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,160
I've seen a lot.

664
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,400
I mean, I've seen Johnny Dangerously a few times

665
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,880
and I don't think any gang is gonna like the cut

666
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,800
of my haircuts jib.

667
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,720
I don't think my haircuts gonna cut the mustard.

668
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
Are you fucking kidding me?

669
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,280
Yeah, it's like too shaggy, I think.

670
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,000
I think you've got a-

671
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,680
I like it upstairs with like a real-

672
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,360
You've got a real, I would say, a hard cut.

673
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
No, I'm saying, I think that you,

674
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
when you put some time and effort into it,

675
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,280
which I'll be honest with you, Justin, is pretty rare.

676
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah.

677
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,400
I think you can have a pretty nice pompadour going for you.

678
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Oh yeah, definitely.

679
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
Maybe, but I'd have to definitely get it trimmed.

680
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,920
Maybe take some of the layers out so they're a little flatter.

681
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
No, no, feather your bangs.

682
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
It's beautiful when you feather them.

683
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,360
I'm gonna go to my guy, Sunny, and just see.

685
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,040
I'm gonna give him Johnny Dangerously

686
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,200
just a poster as a reference.

687
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
Yeah, sure.

688
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,040
And tell him not to do that cut,

689
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,080
but to encompass the feeling of Johnny Dangerously

690
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,120
in your haircut.

691
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,040
Okay, but let me just, real quick,

692
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,200
the issue for you joining, not joining this game,

693
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
is your hair, right?

694
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,880
And not your inability to shoot 30 cops

695
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
outside of a train station.

696
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,320
I could shoot, how fast are these cops running?

697
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,560
It's not, okay, it's obviously a moral issue.

698
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,920
Oh, because I played a lot of video games.

699
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,760
So I mean, ideally I wouldn't have to kill any cops.

700
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,000
But what do you think gangs do in the 1940s?

701
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,720
They rob?

702
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
Drag race?

703
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,120
Drag race, that's one.

704
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
Actually, nobody knows what happened in the 40s.

705
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,000
There were wars.

706
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,720
That's mainly what the gangs did is they fought our wars.

707
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
But most of the records have been lost to time.

708
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah, well, except for on their gangland tapestries.

709
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,120
Yeah, right.

710
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,160
I mean, there are the cave paintings, of course, but.

711
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,440
Yeah, and their urns that they used to use

712
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
to carry moonshine from county to county.

713
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,400
I don't think that I would fit in well

714
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
with any kind of gang, with the 1940s gang.

715
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Now, why is that just or any?

716
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
There are several things.

717
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,580
Okay.

718
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:49,300
One of the big ones is that I like to sleep in.

719
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,700
Have you thought about maybe just joining a badminton team?

720
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,020
Wait, would the bad part be capitalized?

721
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,580
Because that might be along the lines of where I'm going here.

722
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,340
No, it would just be-

723
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,260
Like a badminton team.

724
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,820
Right, no, it would just be like a group of people

725
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,860
who played badminton.

726
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,420
Could I also suggest joining a glee club

727
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,020
similar to the Wiffenpoofs?

728
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,820
This would be good.

729
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah, sure.

730
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,660
Well, let me ask you guys.

731
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,220
Well, okay, how many crime would we do?

732
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,660
How many crime?

733
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,420
You do crime.

734
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,060
It depends on, I mean-

735
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,340
If I showed up and we had played badminton

736
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,700
or sung, you know, my old Kentucky home or something

737
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,660
and we did it really well,

738
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,020
and then afterwards I was like,

739
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,660
guys, I'm ready to do a crime.

740
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,700
Would they be like, would they know where to go to do one?

741
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,500
Or would it just be like-

742
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,420
I picture you guys walking around pushing over

743
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,620
like newspaper stands.

744
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,780
Oh, those things.

745
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,340
Well, I do enough of that trying to practice my free running.

746
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,660
So, I mean, I knock a lot of those over anyway.

747
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Are you still into percure?

748
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,540
Yeah, I'm getting-

749
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,300
You should join a parkour gang.

750
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,220
Oh, a percure game would be great because I can-

751
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,740
You just leave footprints everywhere.

752
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,180
Well, that's bad for a crime.

753
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,140
You kids, you kids did it again.

754
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,940
I just painted that wall.

755
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,420
Why'd you string on that wire I left lying around?

756
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,940
How can we never see that in modern crime dramas?

757
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,260
Like there's no episode of CSI where they follow

758
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,940
like shaded in footprints, family circus style, you know?

759
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,660
Yeah, right.

760
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,820
Where they get a big magnifying glass

761
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,100
and look at the black footprints that are-

762
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,420
Sure.

763
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,460
Oh man, what if Jeffy did commit a crime

764
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,820
and they had to track him down on CSI?

765
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,580
There were just red footprints everywhere.

766
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,180
Hey, you're welcome, Mad TV.

767
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,980
On a completely different note.

768
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,620
Oh, good.

769
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,820
But similar note.

770
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,340
So the neighborhood that our company house

771
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,700
where all of our young actors live,

772
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,700
it's not a nice neighborhood.

773
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,340
And the other day they were telling me that

774
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,980
this group of young people was just throwing rocks at cars.

775
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,260
Like on the street, not even cars driving by,

776
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,460
just parked cars on the street, just throwing rocks at them.

777
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,020
Can we-

778
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,580
Why?

779
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,060
Before we jump to any conclusions,

780
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,540
are we sure that those cars didn't ask those children

781
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,140
to throw rocks at them?

782
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,300
Kind of Knight Rider situation.

783
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,100
What?

784
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,940
The Knight Rider where the cars are talking to them

785
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,220
and asking them to throw rocks at them.

786
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,980
You know Knight Rider.

787
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,020
You know Knight Ritter.

788
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,580
Knight Rider.

789
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,940
With John Ritter.

790
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,700
It's just John Ritter giving David Hasselhoff piggyback rides.

791
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,740
Ritter Rider.

792
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,660
You guys see that episode of Ritter Rider?

793
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:28,900
Yeah.

794
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,620
I love that one.

795
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,260
Oh my God.

796
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,940
Sorry, I just had the vision of John Ritter

797
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,460
voiced by Mr. Feeney

798
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,140
and I'm gonna have a rod all day now.

799
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,180
Perfect.

800
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,180
That's gonna really impede my workday.

801
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,620
We don't need to join gangs if we want to make money

802
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,260
because we have one dependable source of income

803
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,100
and that is the money.

804
00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:07,060
I got a message for Clay from your brother Jack

805
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,580
and Jack just wanted to stop by and say happy birthday.

806
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,940
He was rolling by.

807
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,860
He couldn't stick around until we started recording

808
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,380
but he wanted us to tell you.

809
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,420
He left this message.

810
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,940
He left a note for us

811
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,940
and he said he hoped that your sweet 16

812
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,780
is the sweetest 16 ever

813
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,380
and I have a feeling in my gut

814
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,700
that it's gonna be pretty sweet.

815
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,180
Happy birthday, Clay.

816
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,140
I did not know that 16 and before this 15 year olds

817
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,100
are listening to this show

818
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,620
because we get pretty blue.

819
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,180
It's a little blue.

820
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,940
We just talked about bone in with syrup.

821
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,220
I love course language and adult subject matter.

822
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,420
Adult situations.

823
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,300
What I don't want is for kids to listen to the things I say

824
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,420
and then go to school

825
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,060
and then tell their friends about adult situations

826
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,980
and then they tell two friends

827
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,420
and then they tell all their friends

828
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,940
and then all of a sudden

829
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
I'm basically a child pornographer.

830
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,100
I don't know that you know what that means.

831
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,660
Yeah, I saw little children.

832
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,620
Sorry, can we go to the next thing?

833
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,900
Yeah, I want to make a website

834
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,580
about how much of a creep Griffin is.

835
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
Does anybody know how to do that?

836
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,660
You should check out the all new Squarespace Sigs.

837
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,380
Tell me about it.

838
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,460
Well, the main points are it's got beautiful new templates.

839
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,020
It's an easy drag and drop interface.

840
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,860
I had an incredible responsive design

841
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,780
and it's social media connectivity

842
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,220
is just out of this world.

843
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,100
Oh, really?

844
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,980
Like on the moon?

845
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,380
You can socially connect to people.

846
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,940
I am Mars curiosity robot.

847
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,420
Check out my social media connectivity.

848
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,420
You know, he's tweeting.

849
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,900
Yeah, he is tweeting and it's hilarious.

850
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,380
He's good.

851
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,180
He's doing good.

852
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,260

is redoing his entire website with Squarespace Sigs

861
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,940
and doing a video series about it.

862
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,660
Oh, cool.

863
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,420
It's got legit tech.

864
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,820
It's legit, my brother, my brother and me.

865
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,460
The all new Squarespace six has got legit tech,

866
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,420
by his quote.

867
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,220
Friends, do you have a video game website,

868
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,420
podcast or app that needs some affordable original music?

869
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,100
We got the guy for you.

870
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Jake Hawken, H-A-W-K-E-N.

871
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,580
He's at jakehawken.com.

872
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,340
He does outro music for your podcast.

873
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,220
He'll do theme music and carry it around in a boom box.

874
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,860
He'll do sound effects for your website,

875
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,460
graphic novel or app.

876
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,740
Don't buy that stupid ass catalog music.

877
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,220
Don't buy that beat ass catalog music.

878
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,580
When I hear the same music on Project Runway

879
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,140
and then later on America's Next Top Model,

880
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,340
here's what I always say,

881
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,860
and you'll find this on his website.

882
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,140
I say, fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

883
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,580
That's my thing.

884
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,300
That's what I say.

885
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,940
Fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

886
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,440
Yeah.

887
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,340
So, uh.

888
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,780
Hey, just real quick, one more time.

889
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,980
Fuck, should have called Jake Hawken.

890
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,420
Should have called Jake Hawken.

891
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:16,980
Yeah.

892
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,340
And you can get that as a sound effect

893
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,780
that his website's available there

894
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,260
at jakehawken, H-A-W-K-E-N.com.

895
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,140
And the last thing we need to mention,

896
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,180
and gosh, guys, if you are not having a good week,

897
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,220
you should know how many weeks of advertising

898
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,300
our friends at Extreme Restraints bought with us

899
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,060
because it is going to get so real

900
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,820
over the next few months.

901
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,460
It is going to get-

902
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,660
Buckle up.

903
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,300
Buckle up.

904
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,860
And by which I mean to the bed with your lover.

905
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,100
Right.

906
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,540
You can provide that for you now.

907
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,580
I have suggested that we retitle the podcast

908
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,940
The McElroy Brothers Extreme Restraints Comedy Hour.

909
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,380
Buckle up and fuckle up

910
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,220
because it's Extreme Restraints time.

911
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,940
If you need some sex toys, and I mean sex toys,

912
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,940
this stuff gets real.

913
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
We have a coupon code.

914
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,500
It's MIDLIST.

915
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,220
And if you use the coupon code extremerestraints.com,

916
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,260
then you are going to get 20% off

917
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,300
on any week that you hear this advertisement.

918
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,580
So that's the first thing that we want to get across to you.

919
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,740
Here are some things that listeners have bought

920
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,180
using this extreme code.

921
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,180
Anal trainer set.

922
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,940
Astro-glide.

923
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,620
Now, we're going to have to stop

924
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,980
and go bullet point by bullet point here

925
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,020
because in what way does my anus

926
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,100
does pretty much everything I need it to do right now,

927
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,780
and it does it pretty good, I think.

928
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,060
Nope, that's incorrect.

929
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,420
Your anus is an untapped well of pleasure.

930
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,140
Oh, okay.

931
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,780
It's an untapped pleasure well.

932
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,020
Some other things our listeners have bought.

933
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,460
A swirl bloom vibrator.

934
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,300
Wall beggar vibrating dildo.

935
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,500
Five inch slim vibe.

936
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,460
Astro-glide.

937
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,380
A cute harness dildo.

938
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,020
Butterfly.

939
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,220
Now, is that a cute harness dildo?

940
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,180
Yes, it is an adorable harness dildo.

941
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,620
But anyway.

942
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,780
Do you think a swirl bloom vibrator

943
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,860
is what Willy Wonka uses to masturbate?

944
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Hand me the schnauzberry flavored lube.

945
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,180
Ew, no!

946
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,740
I also want to point this out

947
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,500
because I was going through their website,

948
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,380
as I often do.

949
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,900
I love that under categories,

950
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,580
there's a dildo category

951
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,220
and then a separate huge dildo category.

952
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,540
Don't get it twisted.

953
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,660
If you're in the dildo category,

954
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,300
like these look,

955
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,580
these are way too small for my gaper.

956
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,060
Then you can, oh man!

957
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,420
Let me upgrade you.

958
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,900
You can, there was a website designer

959
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,660
who was browsing the dildos one day

960
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,540
and said, and someone came in and he said,

961
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,340
Darla, did you see this new dildo we just got in?

962
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,420
And she said, no, Philip, I didn't see it.

963
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,300
He said, look at this.

964
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
I don't even think you can legally classify

965
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,260
this as a dildo.

966
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,500
It needs its own taxonomy.

967
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,780
It needs its own taxonomy in our architecture

968
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,340
because it is so huge.

969
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,620
I don't want anyone to buy it

970
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
expecting a standard dildo.

971
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,340
What have I done?

972
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,940
I have to put this in me now.

973
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,980
I'm looking for branding opportunities

974
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,700
just all the time.

975
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,340
And I think what if big dildos,

976
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,700
what if they're called thrill-dos?

977
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,260
Oh no, oh no.

978
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,220
You put them in the freezer.

979
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,420
It's a chill-do.

980
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,620
Oh no.

981
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,500
So go to extremistrace.com

982
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,100
and use the coupon code MIDDLIST

983
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,380
to get 20% off.

984
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,100
Go now.

985
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
I think a dildo would not feel very good.

986
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,340
Not at first.

987
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,300
No, not at first.

988
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,460
Cover it in hot Cairo though.

989
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,820
And you are in business,

990
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,860
the business of sadness.

991
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,260
Yeah, a couple weeks ago,

992
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,860
I started hanging out with a lady.

993
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,380
She was really cool

994
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,580
and she seemed to like me as well.

995
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,220
A few days later,

996
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
she sent me a message to let me know

997
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,460
that she only wanted to be friends.

998
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,420
I was a little sad.

999
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,580
I got over it until I learned why

1000
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,660
she was dating a magician,

1001
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,300
an actual magician,

1002
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,700
a man whose job it is

1003
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,020
to perform magic tricks.

1004
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,300
I was passed over for a magician.

1005
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,340
How should I feel about this?

1006
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,020
Should I feel offended

1007
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,540
or have I dodged a bullet

1008
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,180
that's from beaten in Brisbane?

1009
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,380
I mean, I think,

1010
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,060
I think, you know what?

1011
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,860
You know what? Go to the fridge.

1012
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,020
Let's go crack a cold one.

1013
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,660
Yeah.

1014
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,300
Classic tale.

1015
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,780
Listen, man.

1016
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,140
Boy meets girl.

1017
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,340
Girl loves magician.

1018
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,020
Not gonna lie to you, man.

1019
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,900
That's a bad beat.

1020
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:42,820
You know what?

1021
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,020
Brother, you just,

1022
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,660
ta-da.

1023
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,380
You fucked up.

1024
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,440
Yep.

1025
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,660
Magically, she made yourself

1026
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,700
confidence disappear.

1027
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,200
Poof.

1028
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,340
David Copperfield's greatest tricks.

1029
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,500
Hey, you shouldn't feel that bad though

1030
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,660
because some, some illusionists,

1031
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,700
as they prefer,

1032
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,900
are really dope.

1033
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,060
Like, one time David Copperfield got mugged.

1034
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,580
Do you guys, have you guys heard this story?

1035
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,080
Yeah.

1036
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,780
No, is this true?

1037
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,900
This is 100% true.

1038
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
One time David Copperfield got mugged

1039
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,460
with two assistants, right?

1040
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,020
And when he went to go empty out his pockets

1041
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,380
and he palmed his cell phone

1042
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,300
and his wallet and his passport,

1043
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,100
he palmed them and it revealed empty pockets.

1044
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,780
He palmed them so the mugger would think

1045
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,820
he didn't have anything.

1046
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,980
And okay, so this, and, and then like,

1047
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,540
obviously the mugger was arrested and so.

1048
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,540
But then he escaped and appeared on the balcony.

1049
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,040
Right.

1050
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,980
So here's some interesting things about this story.

1051
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,420
One, he let his assistant go.

1052
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,220
He let his assistants be robbed.

1053
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,660
He didn't use, he didn't,

1054
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,340
he didn't have a trick to get out of that.

1055
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,180
So that's, that's problem one.

1056
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,660
He didn't apparate a gun or a taser.

1057
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,540
Right, exactly.

1058
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
A dove, maybe, just as a distraction.

1059
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,860
The other problem with this is that

1060
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,540
David Copperfield is apparently

1061
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,780
in such financial dire straits

1062
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,500
that he'll risk taking a bullet to the chest

1063
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,980
just to preserve the like 30 dollars

1064
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,020
and pita pit coupon he has in his wallet.

1065
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,620
First off, what if he had nine stamps

1066
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,540
on that coupon and was one away?

1067
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,500
Yeah, that's true.

1068
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,300
That's true.

1069
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,460
Second off, those, those abilities

1070
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,700
are rarely, if ever, practical.

1071
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,100
So I think he just.

1072
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,980
Don't you think at this point,

1073
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,060
like there's no challenge anymore?

1074
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
And he's like, this is, this is my time.

1075
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,060
Right, I have to push this to the next level.

1076
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,420
I have to go real magic.

1077
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,140
Also, if you're a robber and you're robbing someone

1078
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,420
and they do magic to you,

1079
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,420
I don't think you shoot them.

1080
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,580
I think, I think you maybe let them go scot free

1081
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,740
and say, that was the most creative being robbed

1082
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,620
I've ever seen.

1083
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,300
You are free to go.

1084
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
Another fine performance, Mr. Copperfield.

1085
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
The moral of the story is magicians are awesome.

1086
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,060
Some magicians are awesome.

1087
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,260
What if this girl is like dating Lance Burton,

1088
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,460
the coolest magician?

1089
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,660
That is, that is an issue.

1090
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,140
Then, then you can't feel bad.

1091
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,420
But if it's like David Blaine,

1092
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,300
then yeah, you should probably feel bad about it.

1093
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,540
Yeah.

1094
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,820
If it's Chris Angel, well, yeah, he's awesome.

1095
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,220
I don't know.

1096
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,940
David Blaine can hold his breath for a really long time.

1097
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,460
No, David Blaine can hold his breath

1098
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,900
so he can't smell his own farts.

1099
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,620
I hate that guy.

1100
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:26,500
What?

1101
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,860
Was that an insult?

1102
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,820
I'm not sure.

1103
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,700
I just hate himself.

1104
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,460
Ah, man.

1105
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,980
When Travis hates somebody enough,

1106
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,140
he just references their flatness.

1107
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,220
And then that's, that's enough to really put him in that place.

1108
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,700
Don't let Leo DiCaprio hear you talking that way.

1109
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,260
Cause he, he, he won't let you live it down.

1110
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,140
He loves DB.

1111
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:46,500
What?

1112
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,620
Oh yeah.

1113
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,300
The first, the first in his first hit special, Street Magic,

1114
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,700
it was hosted by Leo DiCaprio.

1115
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,500
No way.

1116
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,980
Yeah, way.

1117
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,820
That was like prime Leo years.

1118
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,060
Yeah.

1119
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,180
That's why, that's why Kate pushed him off the door at the end of Titanic.

1120
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,580
Let me tell you again about David Blaine.

1121
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
No, no, I get it.

1122
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
He made a card appear on a window.

1123
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,900
No matter who you get dumped for,

1124
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
there are always going to be things about them

1125
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,260
that make it slightly ridiculous because they're not you.

1126
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,620
Yeah, from your perspective,

1127
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,820
nobody's ever said like, yeah, she left me for this guy,

1128
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,460
but he's really good at soccer.

1129
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,020
Yeah, right.

1130
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,020
But to be fair, he's a way better person than me in just about every way.

1131
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,460
In college, I had a girlfriend who left me for a hot air balloon.

1132
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,820
I wish that was the true story.

1133
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,460
I mean, she, she didn't like date the hot air balloon,

1134
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,860
but she did set off on a world adventure for the hot,

1135
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,980
and she said, we can't, when I'm up in the clouds, you know.

1136
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,900
You're just gonna, you're just gonna hold me down.

1137
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,300
Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,460
I gotta cut that sandbag loose.

1139
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,740
It is a different world up there though.

1140
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,860
I mean, to be fair.

1141
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,060
Once you get in the stratosphere.

1142
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,340
It's a whole new world.

1143
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,060
Once you get in the stratosphere, then you just, you die probably

1144
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,620
because hot air balloons don't provide you with any protection.

1145
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,100
There's zero, there's absolutely no protection within the elements.

1146
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,380
Hey, NBNBAM, that's us.

1147
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,380
I want to ask my girlfriend to marry me.

1148
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,020
I know the how part already, but I'm torn on the when, the when.

1149
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,500
Wow.

1150
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,660
I had been planning on a day that's special to us,

1151
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,300
but I think she suspects that when I would ask her.

1152
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,860
So my question is, do I go with the element of surprise

1153
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,140
or the something expected yet meaningful?

1154
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,460
And that's suitor from the south.

1155
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,260
I have some insight into this question.

1156
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,660
Would you like to hear it?

1157
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,220
Yeah.

1158
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,140
I think I know what it is, but you don't.

1159
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,140
But yes, my wife thought that she,

1160
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,380
that I was going to propose to her on Christmas and I didn't.

1161
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,620
I proposed to her on New Year's Eve.

1162
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,220
So she was fine in the end.

1163
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,860
But there was a six day gap there.

1164
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,580
But there was a six day gap where things could have been better.

1165
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,060
She could have been in a better mood.

1166
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,500
Now let me, let me give the counterpoint.

1167
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,140
Oh, great.

1168
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,620
My girlfriend and I like knew what exactly,

1169
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,100
almost what time her ring was going to be available.

1170
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,180
She knew it was happening and said to me,

1171
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,740
if you wait, I will kill you.

1172
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,140
Okay.

1173
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,380
Right.

1174
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,100
So I like proposed as soon as I got home, which was fine.

1175
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,060
It was very nice for us.

1176
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,300
Got down to one knee, did the sets of romantic things,

1177
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,820
butter flowers, very nice.

1178
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,060
And then I had to spend the rest of time explaining to people

1179
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,380
why I didn't do something more surprising.

1180
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,020
Sure.

1181
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,540
Now here's the counter counterpoint.

1182
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,020
Um, who wants to get married?

1183
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,940
Bond, chain, milk, milk, milk.

1184
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,060
Don't milk the cow.

1185
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,060
You can go out and get it.

1186
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,740
You don't have to tie yourself down with a, don't just fry

1187
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,020
for you on that hot air balloon.

1188
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,180
Cause you don't need a sandbag tying you down.

1189
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,140
Let's go.

1190
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,860
See, just go.

1191
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,660
So your seeds in the field of pussies.

1192
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,460
I don't remember that.

1193
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,300
Wait a minute.

1194
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,420
Stop the world.

1195
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,860
I want to get off.

1196
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,460
What did you just say?

1197
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,620
So your seed in a field of pussies.

1198
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,140
What kind of ship are you running here?

1199
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,220
So your wild oats in the pussy dirt.

1200
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,100
It's not a ship.

1201
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,700
It's a farm, obviously.

1202
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,420
Pussy farm.

1203
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,940
Zynga's new Facebook hit.

1204
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,780
Come water my pussy so I can get 30 pussy coins.

1205
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,500
Have you seen my pussy cow?

1206
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,660
I think it wandered onto your Facebook farm.

1207
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,060
Give us $30.

1208
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,460
We'll give you 600 John John points.

1209
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,100
And you can use to buy new pussy cows.

1210
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,420
Oh, the pussy wolf came and snuck into your farm.

1211
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,780
Made all your rutabagas.

1212
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,900
You pussy bagas.

1213
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,740
Our wolves are vegetarian.

1214
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,580
Don't steal that in your Facebook game.

1215
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,860
We'll sue you.

1216
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,460
Come on down to John John ranch.

1217
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,740
For all the, we got milk for the pussy cows.

1218
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,940
Ready to move on.

1219
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:09,060
There was a lot of, I guess it's good that we do a split.

1220
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,700
Every now and then, because we usually talk about boners a lot,

1221
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,260
but there was a lot of discussion of the vagina

1222
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,300
and its parts in this particular episode.

1223
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,420
Watch out throwing shit.

1224
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,580
We've got your number.

1225
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,220
We know how to talk to the ladies.

1226
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh yeah.

1227
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,700
There's nothing ladies like more than hearing about their bits.

1228
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,340
Listen, we were very clinical about it.

1229
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,780
That is all official terminology.

1230
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,860
We are nothing if not respectful.

1231
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,500
Right.

1232
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,380
That is all official terminology.

1233
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,020
We weren't making fun of stupid vaginas.

1234
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,100
You go in instead of out, dumb.

1235
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,300
What's your deal, you hidey bastards?

1236
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,800
Yeah.

1237
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,820
Why are you so ashamed of what's going on in there?

1238
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,940
I don't know who this character is,

1239
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,620
but I want to fucking kill him.

1240
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,980
I want to stick some sort of hot iron inside of my brain

1241
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,380
and burn out whatever part of it that voice comes from.

1242
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,860
So this is the part where we plug our social on NBNBAM's Twitter.

1243
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,940
You can find us on Facebook if you want to join that group.

1244
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,300
That's a robust group.

1245
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:13,800
Yeah.

1246
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,380
If you want to help water our pussy plants on Sunshine Ranch,

1247
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,420
you can go to Facebook.com slash bambambam.

1248
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:20,920
Yeah.

1249
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,820
People like to make fan art sometimes,

1250
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,620
but don't do it for any of the things we said this time.

1251
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,500
Hey, all the things that we said today, off limits.

1252
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,620
This episode is non-canonical.

1253
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,700
This is outside of the NBNBAM-verse.

1254
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,140
This is our lost episode.

1255
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,100
You only wished we lost it.

1256
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,380
Generations from now, people will ask if this episode ever really existed.

1257
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,180
Thank you for people tweeting about the show with the NBNBAM hashtag,

1258
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:56,580
including Laura Nesson, Chase Router, Adams Router,

1259
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,940
Adams Holds, Wiggy1978, The Unchosen One,

1260
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,260
Waylon Baw, Hello Joe Ben, DuckLips513 as always,

1261
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,660
Jonathan Byathan, anybody else?

1262
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,020
I'm forgetting about Chorus, BuzzClick, Hallways,

1263
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,900
Fanta Creek Music.

1264
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,500
That's every name.

1265
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,580
That's all the Twitters.

1266
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:24,340
Please go subscribe to our show, review our show, rate it, all that good stuff.

1267
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,620
And Justin, don't we have a new way of contacting us, do we not?

1268
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,660
We do.

1269
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:35,460
We actually now have a My Brother, My Brother, Me mailing address.

1270
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:46,580
You just send stuff to NBNBAM and it is PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1271
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,140
So if you want to mail us pretty much anything.

1272
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,900
Not poison.

1273
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,260
Not poison.

1274
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,700
I can't stress enough.

1275
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,220
Please don't kill us.

1276
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,460
Yeah.

1277
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,740
Now I will also say that if you mail us baked goods, we probably won't eat them.

1278
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,300
But I just say that and if somebody actually does send them, probably will eat them.

1279
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,580
Because they're just make the baked goods and then take a picture of it

1280
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,540
and then mail that to us.

1281
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,500
And a video of you eating the first one of the batch.

1282
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,060
Right.

1283
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,860
That's what we need.

1284
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,580
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1285
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,900
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1286
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,620
For sure.

1287
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,260
Can I do that?

1288
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,940
Go ahead.

1289
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,660
Okay, thanks.

1290
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,540
Oh, we haven't talked about this in a long, long time.

1291
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,780
But if you would like some My Brother, My Brother and Me gear.

1292
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:35,940
We have a MBNBAM, I call it, I think of it as the detective shirt.

1293
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,260
But I don't know what most people think of that.

1294
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,860
The adventure shirt.

1295
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,580
Adventure shirt.

1296
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,900
And then we have a shirt for people who's nasty gum, which is an old favorite.

1297
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,300
So that's at maxfunstore.com.

1298
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,180
You just buy those.

1299
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,300
They'll just sell them to you.

1300
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,700
And we also haven't mentioned in a while about tweeting quotes you like from the show.

1301
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,180
It's always great to see people who have just started listening

1302
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,020
and gone back through the back catalog.

1303
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,660
And they'll quote something from like episode 42 or something.

1304
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,020
And it always cracks me up.

1305
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,700
So thanks for that.

1306
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,660
Two calls to action.

1307
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,660
Go listen to the other Maximum Fun shows.

1308
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,620
Throwing Shade, Memory Palace, the new one.

1309
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,220
Jordan, Jesse, go stop podcasting yourself.

1310
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,540
Judge John Hodgman, International Waters.

1311
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,460
All extremely good.

1312
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,420
Second call to action.

1313
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,100
My Yahoo answer.

1314
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,500
I still got a few great standbys.

1315
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,660
And thank you so much if you send in the Yahoo answers.

1316
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,980
But the well is drying up a little bit.

1317
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,140
And that means I have to go find my own answers.

1318
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,500
And that's the worst.

1319
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,740
So if you feel inspired, email us.

1320
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,500
Mbembem at gmail.com or mbembem at maximumfun.org.

1321
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,060
And send in some Yahoo's.

1322
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,100
Nothing gross, only funnies.

1323
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,820
Thanks.

1324
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,780
Thanks.

1325
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,100
Speaking of Yahoo's, here's the final one of the day.

1326
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,740
It was sent in by Jeremy Walker.

1327
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,540
Thank you, Jeremy.

1328
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user swimmer899, who asks,

1329
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,660
why do I very often dream that I'm wearing diapers?

1330
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,300
I'm Justin McElroy.

1331
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

1332
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1333
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,820
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

1334
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,620
Kiss your dad.

1335
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,460
Square on the lips.

1336
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,580
Square on the lips.

1337
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,260
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1338
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,300
Keep your heart.

1339
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,460
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1340
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,420
Keep your heart.

1341
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,780
Man, these girls are smart.

1342
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,540
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1343
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:41,460
Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart.
