1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,000
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother,

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,200
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I am the being formerly known as Griffin McElroy, who has

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:05,520
transcended into a ball of energy that now surfs the cosmos on a wave of pure energy and joy.

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,960
You made it to the next level.

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,120
I'm thrilled to hear about your ascendance, Griffin. What was the motivator behind it?

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,720
Sorry, I am getting, I guess, a little bit nostalgic, but I am no longer

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,160
the one called Griffin. I am now just sort of a being that is just light, if you can imagine that.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,280
Okay. Can we just go with Griffin with like a lowercase g, like you're no longer identified as

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,680
the noun Griffin, but now just the idea? I guess so. We apply the word Griffin to the energy space

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,680
that you are inhabiting, Griffin. Can you just call me Delight? Okay, Delight. That's cool. Bliss.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
Bliss. This is my brother, Delight Bliss. Yeah, that's me. Bliss Delight. Delight

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,040
Blissington. This is my brother, Bliss Delight. What happened? It's pretty cool out here in the

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,160
cosmos, I got to say. Just surfing by Alpha Centauri, just seeing what's beautiful and

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,960
you know what the answer is? Fucking everything, guys. Look around. Bliss Delight, how did this

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,640
state befall you? Well, it started like all good stories with a harrowing journey through the

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,800
darkness as a future EGOT winner, Lin-Manuel Miranda, just started buffeting me with pictures

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,960
of gold dust, which you know I didn't like. Every day I would wake up and the pictures of gold dust

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,840
that I had just like shoveled out of my sinking security boat, you know what I mean? Like my own

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,680
sort of sense of self security, self preservation. We've all read Malcolm Gladwell books. We know all

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
about your security boat and all of that. We got you. I had to get these pictures of gold dust out

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
of my boat. Every morning I wake up, more pictures in the boat and there was a malevolent, I'll go

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,600
ahead and call him a demon. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton creator and demon. Lin-Manuel Miranda

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,480
just covered me in these pics and finally when I reached my breaking point, I could take no more,

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,800
he turned into an angel. It's kind of like a reverse Satan. He pulled like a reverse Satan

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,920
720 heel flip. Which will get you like super high points on Tony Hawk. Yeah of course, if you do it

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,520
at the end of your combo. He sent a video, he secured a video of Carly Rae Jepsen wishing me,

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,200
just saying that I was doing a great job. And that's when my transformation began.

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
Like Rachel was home when it happened, she was like whoa Griffin, light's coming out of your

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
fingertips and all your teeth. And I was like yeah, I think something big is, I think the

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,440
winds of change are blowing. Something big is in the works. My current body is a trailer for my

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,320
future body. Exactly, and this happened the afternoon after we recorded the last episode,

37
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,160
so we didn't really get a chance to talk about it. And I'm glad we didn't, because this morning I

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,840
woke up to another video of... It's weird to even say it out loud, isn't it? It's weird,

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
this is I guess the first time I've said it out loud. Tyra Banks saying that I did a great job.

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Ty Ty baby. Ty Ty baby. She didn't blow me a kiss like CRJ did, and that was, I mean,

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
an important catalyst in the transformation. But yeah, now I'm just sort of like a being of joy,

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,000
and I just sort of surfed the cosmos. I'm going up Orion's belt right now and going under the

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
belt and checking out his stick. Don't look to the left. Nope, I already did. It's beautiful,

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,520
all of creation guys, look around. Orion has a beautiful hog. Beautiful hog on Orion,

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:35,040
look around guys. I actually woke my wife and infant daughter up this morning by about 745,

46
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,000
I guess it was 745-8, something like that. Just loudly exclaiming, that motherfucker.

47
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,680
I just watched the video. That's how he does you, hot and cold. That's what makes Hamilton

48
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,200
such a great creative endeavor, is it comes at you hot and cold. And that's Lin himself,

49
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,240
man. He is- He'll torture you, and then just when you think, I can't handle it anymore,

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,280
he brings you the coolest bowl of water, and you're just like, oh, relief.

51
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,880
A cool, sweet bowl of water, of sweet, sweet water, yeah. And that's what CRJ and Tyra mean to

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,280
me. Literally, just the two best people in the world, and now they've said my name, or my former

53
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,320
name, because now I'm Bliss Delight. Correct. It's going to make podcasting maybe a little

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
bit harder, because I can't click the stop button on my mouse to stop this recording.

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
How did you start it? I have a helper. Helper monkey?

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
I have a helper monkey that does my podcast buttons for me. Who ironically is named Griffin.

57
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,920
Yes. No relation.

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,640
No relation whatsoever. So can we assume if we say Griffin in the next hour or so-

59
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,120
I will not answer, that's right. But Travis and I are talking to your monkey,

60
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
who will then pass the message on to you through vibration.

61
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
I think he'll fucking hear you and talk to you, idiot.

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,760
It's also important to note, Justin, that Griffin the helper monkey is spelled with an E-N

63
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,480
at the end, so make sure to pronounce that.

64
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,720
Just because I'm a being of pure joy energy,

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
doesn't mean I'm not going to call you guys out on your shit, okay?

66
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Can we still make weird references to 80s cartoons that no one else has seen?

67
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
Absolutely. I'm a little bit above that now, having transcended.

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Sure.

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,760
But whatever you guys feel like you want to do, I will support you in that. Unless it's

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,200
really dumb, in which case, you know Bliss Delight's not going to stand for that.

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
All right. Travis, Bliss Delight, here we go.

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,080
Also, I've been watching a lot of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I have decided to become

73
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,320
America's Next Drag Superstar. And my name, yes, conveniently enough,

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,840
will just become Bliss Delight.

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah.

76
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
All right. Can we also say real quick, happy birthday, Lynn.

77
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,280
Happy birthday, Lynn.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah. We didn't say that last time I said it.

79
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah. You're the best.

80
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,560
Much like Justin and Travis's birthdays, I got gifts on it, which I really appreciate.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm getting married and want a surprise bachelor party.

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
The problem is that my male friends don't know each other that well,

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
and none of them are the planning or implement type.

84
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,920
I can't see them calling the others and starting it up.

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,880
I don't want to tell them what to do because I really want it to be a surprise.

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,040
That's from Surprizeless in Stockholm.

87
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,680
You cannot want surprises. You can't want them.

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,320
You can't make surprises happen to you.

89
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Also, surprises are the fucking worst.

91
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, this is the equivalent of like sitting on your hand till it goes

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
over masturbating, giving yourself a stranger.

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,120
That's exactly what it is, Justin.

94
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,480
You can't make surprises that way.

95
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
Let me check the book.

96
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

97
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah. Oh, it's a one-in-one correlation.

98
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,560
You are absolutely correct.

99
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
It's not even a metaphor. It's just literally the exact same thing.

100
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
It's just true.

101
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,440
If I, almost 10 days ago now, when the chrysalis of light was formed around me,

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,880
had said like, boy, I sure hope that my friend Lynn sends me a cool video of my favorite musician,

103
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
Carly Rae Jepsen, saying that I was doing a great job.

104
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,040
I don't think the, I don't think I would have actually had the energy to begin

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
pupating a multiverse guy.

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm not sure the universe would have delivered it to you.

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
That's a good point.

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,600
Actually.

109
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
That's the secret. Well, it's the opposite of the secret.

110
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,400
Opposite of the secret.

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,320
The secret explicitly tells you.

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,280
Yeah. The secret just tells you, get that fucking, get that surprise.

113
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Get that surprise.

114
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,720
That was the original name of the book. Get that surprise.

115
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Get that surprise, hyphen, catch that kid.

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,360
You cannot.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,640
Catch that kid.

118
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
It's one of my favorite running flop house jokes.

119
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Travis is making references to other podcasts, which don't exist in the reality of this podcast.

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
That is non-canonical.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
That's non-canonical.

122
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
It's not to say I don't think those guys exist.

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm saying that no other podcast exists in this fiction.

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
You're with me.

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,360
Okay.

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
Cause it's my favorite podcast.

127
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,680
One of them.

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
I mean, I like other podcasts.

129
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,440
Fuck.

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,120
You can't just want a surprise and not say anything about it also.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,960
You can't get to get it both ways.

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,680
Either you're the engineer of your own surprise destiny,

133
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,200
or you just roll them bones and hope the universe delivers you something.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
Well, and the nice thing is here, you could lay out a framework.

135
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Like you don't have to break down every individual event that you want them to take you to.

136
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,440
You just have to call your most reliable friend out of this group and say,

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
I want you guys to do something.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
Here's everyone's emails and phone numbers.

139
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Contact me again in three months.

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
My boy, we've spent three minutes saying not to explicitly not to do that.

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
And you've just fucking revolted.

142
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
You're just betraying me and Justin.

143
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,040
All you need to do is say, I want a surprise, but not what the surprise must be.

144
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,960
But we're all, that's not, that's terrible advice.

145
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
Cause we're all, we're all wanting surprises.

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
We all want surprises all the time.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,480
All the time.

148
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Wait, let me roll it back.

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
I have a different suggestion.

150
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,680
Great.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
You need to make a new friend before the bachelor party

152
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
who is reliable and organized and a planning friend.

153
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Oh my God.

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
That's such a good idea, Travis.

155
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,840
You have like a screening process to ask people about their event planning backgrounds.

156
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,160
And then you ask them like, what's their, what's their favorite doctor?

157
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
What do they like on their pizza?

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Just like friendship screening questions.

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,920
But keep circling back around to like, so what are we talking about?

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
100, 150 type person engagements?

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
Like how big of an engagement have you planned before?

162
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
How responsible are you?

163
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
Is there like a bachelor party planning?

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
Like you get a wedding planner.

165
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,280
That's exactly, you're on my fucking wavelength.

166
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
Is it too late?

167
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,680
To get David Tutera on board to plan your shit.

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Who's David Tutera?

169
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
You guys are fucking bringing my light down.

170
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,040
Do you know that?

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
I've been surfing the fucking cosmos now for about seven hours.

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
And then this is, this is the event.

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,840
You asking me who David Tutera host of my fair wedding.

174
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,520
Only the best wedding planning show in history, in reality.

175
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,040
Nevermind.

176
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
Move on.

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
Oh, okay.

178
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
A new show, new show title.

179
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,880
Say match to the batch.

180
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,200
And it's, you get a guy who plans your bachelor party

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
and you just gotta say like, ah, naturally.

182
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,200
You just gotta be on board.

183
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
You just gotta be on board with whatever the bachelor party planner

184
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
throws out at you.

185
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,080
And you know what?

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,560
Maybe you didn't even know it was the surprise you wanted,

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
but it was the surprise you needed.

188
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,280
Where he's just like, first, we're going to a strip club.

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
Then we're going to have brunch with your biological dad.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,960
And you're like, what?

191
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm adopted.

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
And you didn't even know.

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,040
We're going to pause the fucking podcast recording right now for two hours.

194
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
So you creeps can go watch My Fair Wedding with David Tutera.

195
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
Just pick any two episodes.

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,520
Throw a dart at your TV when Netflix is on My Fair Wedding by David Tutera

197
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,840
because he would be the ideal host of this show.

198
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,760
Do you know this motherfucker planned a wedding?

199
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
And all he had to go on was this bride.

200
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,120
Her name was Candace.

201
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
And he said, what do you want the theme of the wedding to be?

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,800
And she said, Candace chic.

203
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
And he said, fuck.

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Okay.

205
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
And he did it, and he crushed it.

206
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
Candace chic, he said.

207
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,160
I have this.

208
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
He could do anything with it.

209
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,840
He would throw the perfect bachelor party,

210
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
but you would have to befriend him,

211
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
which is a service I think you'd probably lend out.

212
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
That's a, man, I feel like we really solved that one.

213
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
Yeah, I feel like we fixed it.

214
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Like, David Tutera, get him on the phone.

215
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,760
Do it.

216
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

217
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,920
Please.

218
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
Uh, this Yahoo was, I mean, there are a lot of doozers.

219
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
Maybe it's because we went,

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
oh, we recorded the last episode kind of early,

221
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,840
and so we had like more Yahoo receiving days.

222
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,800
But man, there's some slam dunkerrooskies up in here.

223
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,520
Let's start with this one.

224
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,280
It's from Brooks Oglesby.

225
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,480
Thank you, Brooks.

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user unknown.

227
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,800
That's not like, they're not anonymous.

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,600
That's like the name they've,

229
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
the designation they've chosen for themselves.

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,280
Ooh, is it spelled correctly?

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Uh, it is, yeah.

232
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,640
How did they get that?

233
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,960
Uh, unknown asks,

234
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,400
I need a funny meme for a girl I didn't mean to hurt.

235
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,800
What?

236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,080
So basically, she kind of liked me, and I said no.

237
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,920
I was following bro code.

238
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,400
And we used to have meme arguments,

239
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
so I want to make a meme for her

240
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
so that she knows I still like her as a friend.

241
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
I saw a really good one that had forever alone face to it,

242
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
but I'm not sure.

243
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
It said, they say love can hurt,

244
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
so watch out and be clever.

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Don't start a conversation.

246
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Stay forever alone.

247
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,000
And I'd send that to her with the forever alone face,

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,080
but I think that one would do more bad than good,

249
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,040
so help me out.

250
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,680
Help me out.

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Help me out.

252
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,760
Help me out.

253
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
I need a funny meme for a girl I didn't mean to hurt.

254
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
Should I send her one that says she'll be alone forever,

255
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
or do you think maybe that might do more harm than good?

256
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
You just don't, you don't get the meme.

257
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,920
You don't get the meme.

258
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
I don't.

259
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,840
I, if, I love these memes.

260
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
I just, we love this meme.

261
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
You're crazy for this meme.

262
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
Memes, right?

263
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,280
A lot of people are talking about them,

264
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,640
and even more people wonder,

265
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,160
what are you talking about really with that?

266
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
What the fuck are you saying?

267
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,920
What's a meme?

268
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
What do you mean with meme?

269
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,400
Like I know, like my generation invented meme,

270
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,240
and it had like an actual memeing, a meaning.

271
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
No, memeing.

272
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
We're keeping that.

273
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
Memeing, where it had like what it meant was like

274
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,240
some shit that wasn't really funny,

275
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
but it popped up enough times on internet,

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
or maybe it was funny,

277
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,600
and it just got like endlessly.

278
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,800
Yeah.

279
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,280
Just eviscerated by repetition,

280
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,720
and it became like part of the internet vocabulary.

281
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:06,960
Right.

282
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,920
Like here are some good memes that I know about, okay?

283
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
Mr. T ate my balls.

284
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,080
The end.

285
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
That's the only one that is it.

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
That's the only good meme?

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
The only good meme is Mr. T ate my balls.

288
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,600
Here's what I'm imagining.

289
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,400
This boy, this young man shot down this young woman,

290
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,880
and he was following bro code,

291
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,240
no fucking clue what that means,

292
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,440
and he needs to make it up to her.

293
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,280
So imagine they're on the quad,

294
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,720
and he walks right up to her,

295
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,400
because you gotta have courage in a situation like this.

296
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
You can't fucking back burner this stuff.

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,480
You can't take it through the back channels.

298
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
When you've hurt somebody, don't back channel it.

299
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,800
For the front approach, and he walks up to her,

300
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,280
and he just goes, hey, Star Wars kid.

301
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Think about it.

302
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
Hey, drunk baby.

303
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
Hey, did you hear?

304
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,240
David after dentist.

305
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
And he just hands her a printed out meme.

306
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
Hey, David after dentist, I don't love you.

307
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,640
Hey, Charlie bit my finger and told me

308
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
that I shouldn't date you.

309
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
He was very wise.

310
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,480
I don't love you anymore.

311
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,160
That video where the guy does the nunchuck stunts,

312
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,200
and then tries to do a back flip,

313
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,160
and he lands on his neck.

314
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

315
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Also, here's a guy jumping into a frozen pool.

316
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
Excuse me.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
Cancel the question.

318
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Uh oh.

319
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,360
Mr. T ate my balls is 20 years old in 2016.

320
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,400
This year marks the 20th anniversary celebration

321
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,480
of the first launch of the anchor

322
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
of the Ate My Balls web ring,

323
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Mr. T Ate My Balls.

324
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,960
Launched, of course, by Nihal Patel,

325
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,560
a University of Illinois student in 1996.

326
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Oh my God.

327
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,840
I don't know this thing.

328
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,880
I don't know this thing.

329
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,280
Okay, well, that's because this is literally

330
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,960
like your dad's meme.

331
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,880
This is your dad's meme right now.

332
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,760
Let me just give you the web address.

333
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,200
Go to flamesgif.com slash archive

334
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,240
slash eight underscore my underscore balls

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000

What you're gonna get is pictures.

338
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
This is what passed for memes in my day.

339
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,520
20 years ago.

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000
Mr. T Ate My Balls is sort of like a progenitor of our show

341
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,640
because it's pictures of Mr. T

342
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,440
talking about how he wants to eat balls

343
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
and maybe he ate your balls

344
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,080
or perhaps he was planning on enjoying your balls later

345
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,160
or perhaps he had enjoyed your balls previously

346
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
and would like a repeat performance

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
should you have any more balls for him to ingest

348
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
because Mr. T Ate My Balls.

349
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,960
So it felt like a clever turn of phrase.

350
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,080
Just to catch everybody up on like my current light journey,

351
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm having like a full blown panic attack right now

352
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
and it makes it hard to sort of sustain.

353
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,160
And if I lose it,

354
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,920
I'll just be floating in space forever lost

355
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
in my human form.

356
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,960
Well, if you need a reference,

357
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,200
if this book sounds familiar to me,

358
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
it's probably because you've read about it

359
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,080
in Dave Barry's book,

360
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,160
Dave Barry in Cyberspace,

361
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,320
which I bet has the choices cover in the world.

362
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,520
I bet it's Dave Barry floating through stars

363
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,320
and his fingers are plugged into electrical outlets

364
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,040
and he's got like bits and bytes all over his face.

365
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,880
And you know, you want to know the incredible thing?

366
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,960
That book is 120 years old.

367
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,160
He's like the Nostradamus of comedy

368
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,440
somehow in like 1896.

369
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
Dave Barry, Lord Dave Barry said,

370
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
someday Mr. T will eat some balls.

371
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
By the way, a little bit of a disappointment

372
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,520
is just Dave Barry reaching out of a computer screen

373
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
and pressing a key on your computer.

374
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
Which is how he kills you.

375
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,320
To help you get over that disappointment,

376
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,400
I have just purchased a copy of Dave Barry in Cyberspace

377
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
and the next like three episodes

378
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
can just be readings, I think.

379
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
Wait, are you joking?

380
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,520
Because if you are not joking,

381
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
I will do this thing.

382
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
No, I'm doing, it's done.

383
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,160
It's doing this thing, okay.

384
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
Yeah, like Amazon is like, yeah, we got you.

385
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
And then the mailman is going to show up to my house

386
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
like, we got you.

387
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
Make some good comedy out of this.

388
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
You paid 13 fucking dollars for it.

389
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
Next year is the 20th anniversary

390
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
of Dave Barry in Cyberspace.

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,840
So like, I guess he did this the year after Mr. T ate my balls.

392
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
He's like, I've got to get on the internet.

393
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Yeah, yeah, I miss him so much.

394
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Fuck, that's a bad meme.

395
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
Memes are bad.

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
Don't meme everybody, fuck.

397
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
This was a meme before memes even memed.

398
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,800
It doesn't matter.

399
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,880
It's still the same shit of just like,

400
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,560
a joke isn't fucking funny.

401
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,400
The trillionth time is told.

402
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
And that's all memes are.

403
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,440
They're just jokes that you tell trillionth time,

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
except for a success kid.

405
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,600
That's a good one.

406
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,680
But all the other ones are like, fucking, what are you?

407
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,880
That's not even good.

408
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,280
What they ate my balls.

409
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
Justin, just, Griffin, just to be fair,

410
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,480
like that is what a joke is.

411
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,920
You know that, like those joke books

412
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,240
that are like knock knock jokes and shit.

413
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
That's just old memes.

414
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah, but memes, I think memes tend to,

415
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,760
at least in the way it's being used here,

416
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,720
what they do is they take a familiarity

417
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
and they confuse familiarity and repetition

418
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,720
with actual like humor or a joke.

419
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
Like there's not actually a joke.

420
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
It's just sort of like you've seen it enough times

421
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,440
that it's a laugh of recognition.

422
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,680
Like when you've been away for a while

423
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,360
and you see your house and you laugh

424
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,440
because you recognize that that's where you live.

425
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,800
And it kind of looks like a face.

426
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah, it's like the doors of mouth

427
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
and what's going on here.

428
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
And he's gonna eat you when you walk inside

429
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,240
and you gobble up your luggage.

430
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
And your house, as you step inside,

431
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,040
your house is like, I'm gonna eat your balls.

432
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,800
It's like, I love that house.

433
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Guys, I just wanna tell you that this past 10 day

434
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,160
has been pretty great for me

435
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
vis-a-vis like turning into a giant ball of light.

436
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,440
The best thing that's maybe ever happened to me in my life

437
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
is I'm on the checkout page for Dave Barry in cyberspace.

438
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
And there's a little window here that says,

439
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
why wait until January 20th, 2016?

440
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
The expected arrival date

441
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,680
of Dave Barry's in cyberspace to my house.

442
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
And it says, read the beginning of this book for free.

443
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
Start reading button.

444
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,320
Clicking it now.

445
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Processing my request.

446
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,560
Request accepted.

447
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
That's the sound of it downloading.

448
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
I've broken it.

449
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,280
I've broken the app.

450
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
I can see the reviews.

451
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,200
Library journal says hilariously imaginative.

452
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
Nonstop humor.

453
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
Whether you're a computer whiz or a computer nerd,

454
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,360
this tongue-in-cheek guide to computing

455
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
by best-selling humorist Dave Barry

456
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
has enough bite, B-Y-T-E, fuck you in the neck,

457
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
to keep you entertained, published weekly.

458
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
And it spans from all the way

459
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
from computer whiz to computer nerd?

460
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
That's the same shit.

461
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Anyone in that wide spectrum will enjoy this book.

462
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
So I'm not making this up.

463
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
There's a page of reviews.

464
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,160
There's a page of a table of contents.

465
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,320
And then 63 blank pages.

466
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,840
I think I've been bamboozled by Dave Barry again.

467
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
How perfect that the web app

468
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
for Dave Barry's web book doesn't work.

469
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,600
Dark omens.

470
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,880
Bad portents.

471
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
You got me again, Barry.

472
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
Class, classic Barry right there.

473
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,160
That's Barry in a nutshell.

474
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,440
This is like when I bought Dave Barry Teaches Driving,

475
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
and it did not go well.

476
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
I lost my license.

477
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
At the moment you clicked by,

478
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
his car careened into your home through your front door window.

479
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
He's like, let's go, kid.

480
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,920
It was hilarious.

481
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,640
You're with me.

482
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,680
God, that's funny, Dave.

483
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Some of the other big Ate My Ball sites

484
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
were Chewbacca Ate My Balls,

485
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
Neo from The Matrix Ate My Balls.

486
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
I'm assuming all the characters from Wings Ate My Balls

487
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
just because of the time.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
The time of it, yeah.

489
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
The time of it, certainly.

490
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
Two guys, a girl in a pizza place ate my balls.

491
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Kramer ate my balls, certainly.

492
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
Kramer did eat my balls, though.

493
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,160
That one's actually real.

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Guys, we've had a lot of fun today.

495
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
I want to make this explicitly clear.

496
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
Michael Richards did eat my balls.

497
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,880
Why are you fucking laughing at that?

498
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
Well, because now you're a being of light,

499
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,920
you don't have to worry about it anymore.

500
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,840
Yeah, I mean, it helped in the transformation, actually,

501
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
like less, it was more aerodynamic as I sailed a million miles

502
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
into the sky and burst into flames of delight.

503
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,640
But still, in my earth form,

504
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,600
when I was a being of disgusting flesh,

505
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
Michael Richards ate my balls, though, for real, though.

506
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,880
Excuse me, pardon me.

507
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,720
This just in, I just invented the best game of all time.

508
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
Are you ready?

509
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
For the best game of all time,

510
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
I'm going to read you captions from ate my balls sites,

511
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
and you're going to tell me who ate my balls.

512
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
Travis, are you ready to play?

513
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,360
I am.

514
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
This is a bad game.

515
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't believe this is a fucking meme.

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
And now we're like, now we're a part of the machine.

517
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
Meme machine?

518
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
We're part of the ate my balls industrial complex.

519
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
This sucks.

520
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
I hate this podcast.

521
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,960
All right, go.

522
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,920
Your balls are the perfect drug.

523
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm the one without a soul.

524
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm the one who wants to eat your balls.

525
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,120
These are all the same.

526
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
These are all the same.

527
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
I don't know.

528
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
Michael Richards did say some of these things to me,

529
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
but I don't think that's the right answer.

530
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
Your balls are my perfect drug.

531
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,240
I feel like it's a musician and I'm going to be kicking myself.

532
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
You let me violate you and eat your balls.

533
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,760
Hannibal Lecter ate my balls.

534
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
Oh, Travis, it's Trent Reznor ate my balls.

535
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Oh.

536
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,080
Fucking let me down again.

537
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
I don't want to play this game anymore.

538
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
I was going to say Kurt Cobain,

539
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,040
but I didn't.

540
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,640
I don't want to be disrespectful.

541
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,120
Yeah.

542
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,840
Next question, please, God, don't say eat my balls one more time

543
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,120
or else I'll burn the podcast down

544
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
with all three of us inside of it.

545
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
Happy 20th birthday, ate my balls.

546
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,200
You're a great meme in terms of the strict definition

547
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
of that exact phrase.

548
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,200
You really fulfill all the criteria.

549
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I work at a bank in a rich part of town.

550
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm new to the job.

551
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,280
And when I asked for identification,

552
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,240
I get lectured.

553
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
You should know who I am.

554
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,760
I've had an account here longer than you've been alive.

555
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
I have a lot of money in this bank.

556
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
Everyone else here knows me, et cetera.

557
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,320
Brothers, how do I avoid losing my mind?

558
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,560
That's from Pillarade in Pittsburgh.

559
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
You take all the money out that they have in their account.

560
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
You fucking wad it up and you throw it at their fucking face

561
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,800
as hard as you can.

562
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,480
Like, you know, when mobsters like make a point,

563
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
they're like, yeah, here's your fucking money.

564
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,880
That's the caliber I'm talking about.

565
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,960
And I'm saying, take your disrespectful ass

566
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
to the fucking fifth third around the corner.

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm sick of your shit.

568
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,560
Can you imagine looking at, I was about to say a bank teller,

569
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,920
but any human being ever and saying something

570
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,560
along the lines of, you should know who I am.

571
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,640
Do you know?

572
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,800
Okay, but like, if you really want to know how

573
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
to handle the situation, the answer is pity.

574
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
Because if the thing you have to hang your head on

575
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,800
in your twilight years is, well, hey, listen,

576
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,040
at least the people at the bank know who I am,

577
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,920
then you have gone terribly awry.

578
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,600
Like the only time you're allowed to say,

579
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,880
you should know who I am, is if like a wife or loved one

580
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
has been struck on the head and can't remember your name.

581
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
Only then, and maybe not even then.

582
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
In like a nowhere man situation,

583
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,880
if like all of a sudden you go to the bathroom,

584
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
you come back and you're like, I've never had a husband.

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
Like that's when you should know who I am.

586
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,720
You should know who I am.

587
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Can I say something though?

588
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,000
This is sick grift, isn't it?

589
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If this is 2015, I would really think about

590
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
getting back in the game.

591
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,800
I would need some old age makeup put on

592
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,440
by a convincing young cosmetics artist.

593
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
You should know who I am.

594
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm Fifth Thirtington.

595
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,760
I would roll up to the whatever Chase Bank.

596
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
I'm Mark Chase.

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,200
You know me.

598
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
You know my style.

599
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
I've been here for years.

600
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
You should know my style.

601
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,520
I live above the bank.

602
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
I live above the bank.

603
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
I've been here for years.

604
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,440
You should know this style for this guy.

605
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm the old, old man who always drops off

606
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,320
perfect stacks of unmarked bills.

607
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
I need you to call back.

608
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,760
I drop off nasty stacks all the time.

609
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm Mark Chase.

610
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,160
My account number is two.

611
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,960
You should know my style.

612
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
Just go get my stacks.

613
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,320
Go get my stacks please before you make me cry more.

614
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
My stacks are like my children.

615
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,040
Because I could never conceive.

616
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,840
I couldn't conceive because Michael Richards ate my balls.

617
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
Police!

618
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,800
Please just get my money.

619
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Please give me my stacks.

620
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm so tired.

621
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,280
I just want to die.

622
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,720
These young men are keeping my nasty stacks from me.

623
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,920
Well, this bank floor is so hard.

624
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,160
It hurts to stand on it.

625
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,640
Are these lollipops for everyone?

626
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
I tried to fill out the proper withdrawal form,

627
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,160
but the pin broke all my old fingers.

628
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,200
I was here the day you were born in this bank.

629
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,600
The cost of putting a skyrocket in the four nasty stacks.

630
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,720
Your pep needs them.

631
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,240
That's a perfect crime.

632
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Nobody in good conscience is going to turn you away.

633
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
They would give you all the stacks they got on their shelf.

634
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,360
If nothing else, just to make you stop whatever you're doing.

635
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
Please don't cry.

636
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,720
They would even know that you're a young person in old age makeup trying to rob the bank.

637
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,680
That doesn't matter.

638
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,960
They would be made so uncomfortable by you.

639
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,920
You would leave and the manager would be like,

640
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,560
did he just rob the bank? And they'd be like, well, he needed it more.

641
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,760
It wasn't really a robbery.

642
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,120
We just made a charitable donation to old man, young man Griffin.

643
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah, he needed it.

644
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
God, 20 grifteen, you ended too soon.

645
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Fuck, we're in January, January 18th, 18 days too late.

646
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,960
We'll get it in 3015.

647
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,320
The fucking heist of the century.

648
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,120
Yeah, that's a good point.

649
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,280
Not 2115?

650
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,920
I guess.

651
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,480
No, let's do 3015.

652
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,880
Give us something to work towards.

653
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,080
Bank of tech will probably be like pretty advanced at that point.

654
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,880
They'll have like every bank teller wears special glasses that lets them see through

655
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,760
old age makeup.

656
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,480
After a rash of crimes in 2515 by my great, great grandkid who listens to the fucking

657
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,240
archives of this podcast that they found buried under the soil of my basement.

658
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
And they find this and like, oh fuck, this is a great crime.

659
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,080
And then they do it and they're billionaires.

660
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,840
God, my great, great grandkid is so cool.

661
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,600
Too cool for us.

662
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I didn't quite math it out right because I don't think by 2515 I will be two generations

663
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,000
down.

664
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,040
That would be fucking crazy.

665
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,520
You don't know.

666
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,720
Yeah, I don't know.

667
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,120
There's advances in medical technology every day.

668
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,400
Yeah, it's getting wild out there.

669
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,440
It is.

670
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,320
Do you guys want to go to the money zone?

671
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
Is that you saying like, should we go rob Chase Bank right now?

672
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Basically, yeah.

673
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,400
It's the heist of the century.

674
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:41,200
The 25th century, my brother, my brother, me is sponsored in part by nature box.com.

675
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
I don't know if you're familiar with nature box.

676
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,960
If you've never listened to a podcast before, but they have a hundred over 100 tasty options

677
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
like sriracha, roasted cashews and French toast, granola.

678
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,680
I've been really into they have a plantains type vibe that I can get into pretty deeply.

679
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,360
They also have Parmesan garlic pop pops, which I just got a thing.

680
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,520
I just got a thing called peanut butter, Graham and jam trail mix.

681
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
What the fuck does that even mean?

682
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,360
It's just a big bag of sloppy jam.

683
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,320
It's graham crackers covered in peanut butter with like, you know, berries and nuts and

684
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,760
it's like the best.

685
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
But no loose jam.

686
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
No loose jam.

687
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,960
Okay.

688
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,920
That's actually a guarantee they give you before you order anything in nature box.

689
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,720
No loose jam.

690
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,680
No loose jam.

691
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,240
You're not just going to open a bag and a bunch of jam is going to fucking fall out.

692
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,560
We're nature box.

693
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,120
No loose jam accidents since 2014.

694
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,800
They've got a ton of like really great snacks for you to enjoy and they deliver right to

695
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,560
your door and you could try them, mix it up every month, get new snacks.

You go to naturebox.com and unlock a world of taste and possibility.

698
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,840
That's right.

699
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,760
Still the best, still the best marketing writing probably in existence.

700
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,480
Oh, your, your, your fingers are the key to, well, your keyboard's the key.

701
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
Your computer's the key.

702
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,880
Go to naturebox.com and then open the door to the world of taste and possibility.

703
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,960
If you want to improve your style, it can be a little daunting if it's not something

704
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,320
that you're intimately familiar with.

705
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,920
You don't have the time to read Jesse Thorn's, uh, Japanese style fashion magazines that

706
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
he enjoys.

707
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,600
Like he reads voraciously to keep up on the latest trends.

708
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,720
It's impossible.

709
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,600
So, uh, let me recommend to you trunk club.

710
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,240
Okay.

711
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,920
You go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and you're going to answer some simple questions

712
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,480
about your style, your preferences, your size, uh, and you're assigned an expert stylist

713
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
that is going to hand pick clothes for you from the best brands.

714
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,520
You just approve the stuff you like and you send back what you don't.

715
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,920
You're only charged for the stuff that you want and you want to keep.

716
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,840
You get to try it all on, uh, it comes in a big, cool trunk and the stuff you don't

717
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,440
want, you got a prepaid trunk to send it back to them.

718
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,240
And you know what's crazy?

719
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,400
When you say the thing about the, um, the stylist, like I was anticipating I would get

720
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,240
like, you know, a little chat window pop up.

721
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,800
A little fucking dress, dressed up, clippy.

722
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,840
Well, just like a, and it was like, is this a real person or is it, I got a call from

723
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
my stylist, Brooke, and she's like, hi Travis.

724
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,520
And I was like, oh, hi Brooke.

725
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
And we talked about sweaters.

726
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,880
See, I think I would actually, you know how much I love talking to strangers.

727
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
I think I would actually prefer a little clippy that popped up and be like,

728
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
hmm, suspenders with a belt, huh?

729
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

730
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,480
Well, when Brooke dropped the bomb on me that there's like a trunk club store I can go

731
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,520
to in town that has an open bar, like what?

732
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay.

733
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
Yeah, I'm there.

734
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,040
Um, so, uh, in, in anyway, uh, you're going to want to go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

735
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,320
Remember free shipping both ways.

736
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,960
You'll keep the stuff you like, uh, and it's a really great, great, great experiences.

737
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,120
Those stores that Travis mentioned are also in LA, Chicago, Dallas, DC, and New York City,

738
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,920
where you can meet your personal stylist right in front of them.

739
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,720
So again, right now, go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and get your look right.

740
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,400
I want to talk about me undies, me undies, changing the game, wearing them right now,

741
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,040
keeping me fresh, keeping me dry, uh, but not too dry.

742
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,560
I am also wearing me undies.

743
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,040
Oh, nice.

744
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,480
So I just, I'm going to start assuming that all three of us are constantly wearing me undies.

745
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,400
Uh, they're, they're, they're really wonderful.

746
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,360
Listen, Valentine's day is coming up and, and if you want to get your, you know,

747
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,720
zone between your legs and your tummy looking very, very good, I would suggest maybe turning

748
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
to me undies for the perfect solution for that.

749
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
They're really comfy.

750
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,360
They're made of micromodal fabric, meaning they're twice as soft as cotton.

751
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Fuck cotton for real though.

752
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,560
Me undies, they don't just feel great.

753
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
They look really great.

754
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,120
They come in tons of cool prints and styles and new designs come out every month.

755
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,480
And for men and women, you could get a matching set for Valentine's day.

756
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,600
They got this really cute set.

757
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
That's like red with white polka dots and you and your significant other could have

758
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,920
like matching genital sheaths.

759
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,600
I'm like, yeah, go for it.

760
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,720
February has a special limited edition design from the legendary artist, Keith Haring.

761
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
And it's, it's a retro design and it's inspired by love.

762
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,840
Just like me and the three of us always inspired by love.

763
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,280
It's a great Valentine's day gift.

764
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,840
Think about it.

765
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,760
That's how we do our thing.

766
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,880
That's how we do our thing.

767
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Uh, you can win Valentine's day this year.

774
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,560
Me undies, dedicated to providing the world's most comfortable underwears.

775
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,080
Uh, we also have a message for Brittany from Marshall.

776
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,800
Happy, happy, happy birthday, Britt.

777
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,920
You are so amazing and deserve the world.

778
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,640
Sure show.

779
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,480
Now I think that's just XOXO, but I do appreciate you trying to read it as though it were like

780
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
Mandarin.

781
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040
I read what's on the page, Griffin.

782
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,440
You know what, what I really liked that Marshall had more words in this, but he knew he had

783
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,920
crushed it.

784
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,800
Yeah.

785
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,160
This was probably like draft number five and he was just like, you know what?

786
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,200
Simplify, simplify.

787
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,960
Gravity is the soul of wit.

788
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
That's something I come up with.

789
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,520
I'm gonna say happy three times.

790
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,600
Birthday to acknowledge exactly what the day is.

791
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,680
And then the name of the person the message is for.

792
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,120
And then a sentence of nice things.

793
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,160
And then some Mandarin.

794
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,520
A Mandarin proverb that means.

795
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,080
Show show.

796
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,000
That means I love you so much, Brittany.

797
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
It's weird that there's a Mandarin proverb that says I love you so much, Brittany, but.

798
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
And it's only four characters long.

799
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
That's the weirder part.

800
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:21,920
Yeah.

801
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,400
It's just XOXO means that in Mandarin, but.

802
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
Yeah, well, it's an efficient language.

803
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,760
So it's a mysterious language.

804
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,920
I got a message for James Donaldson.

805
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,720
And this is from Susan, Phil, Drew, Ali and Greg.

806
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,920
They say James.

807
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,360
They used some of their characters about four on S's, which is fine.

808
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,720
That's their money.

809
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,960
You fascinate us with your tiny pencils, snazzy style, design skills with a Z and disturbing

810
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
knowledge of fonts and comics.

811
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,400
You're a coolest, least moist, non crevice guy who still can't pronounce the word ambulance.

812
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,560
So happy birthday.

813
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,280
You're awesome.

814
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,160
And we heart you.

815
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,880
You deserve greatness, business cards and this greeting for the McElroy brothers.

816
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
How do you mispronounce?

817
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
You think it's like ambulance?

818
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,600
Maybe he's fucking Jeffy from the Family Circus.

819
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,360
Ambulance.

820
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,840
There's a lot of talking in here about comics.

821
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280
So maybe he was a comic.

822
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,920
Specifically, Jeffy from Family Circus.

823
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,960
He grew up, came out of the comic like Aha's Take On Me.

824
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,400
And he fucking became a comic artist himself because it's like all he knew.

825
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,480
But the only problem is if he tries to say spaghetti, it does, of course, come out paschetti.

826
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,720
And when he says ambulance, it comes out mandolins.

827
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Now, would Cool World be a more topical reference than Aha's Take On Me?

828
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,920
No, because in Cool World, the man went into the cartoon, right?

829
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
But then a cartoon did come out.

830
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,640
I forget.

831
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
And then that cartoon ate my balls.

832
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
Oh, boy.

833
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,640
Oh, boy.

834
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
Actually, if you eat your balls while in toon form, it does trap you in toon form forever.

835
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400
You die in real life.

836
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,360
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

837
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160
And I'm Erin Gibson.

838
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,400
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

839
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,240
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies and an issue important to gay people.

840
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,680
And then we basically make fun of it.

841
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:05,920
Yeah.

842
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,880
And just to answer your question, no, we don't have a marriage pact.

843
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30, we're going to do that with each other.

844
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,120
No, that's true.

845
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,000
Although we have each been divorced three times.

846
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,880
You guys want a Yahoo?

847
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,160
Yes.

848
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,280
Yes.

849
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,840
Bring it.

850
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
This Yahoo was sent in by Joel.

851
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:25,920
OK.

852
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
Joel Davis.

853
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,840
Joel Davis.

854
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
All right, Joel Davis sent this one in.

855
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kenneth, who asks, what's the frequency?

856
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Fuck you.

857
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,820
Come on.

858
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,300
I love it.

859
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,820
Don't ever stop.

860
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,540
Kenneth started his account on January 9, 2016.

861
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,260
I think he started his account to ask this urgent question.

862
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,340
And it is a fucking urgent one.

863
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,980
And frankly, we are now nine days behind the eight ball.

864
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,620
Kenneth asks, what should I do about this coyote my kids have been feeding?

865
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:00,900
What?

866
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,260
So I have two terrible sons.

867
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,980
I added terrible.

868
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,740
I added terrible.

869
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,700
That's a bit of editorializing on my part.

870
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,220
And bliss to light.

871
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,980
But it's true.

872
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,260
I have two terrible sons age 11 and 9.

873
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,060
I just learned about two weeks ago that they have been feeding a wild coyote that lives

874
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,220
in the ground underneath a large flat rock in the woods near our house.

875
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,820
He, in fact, seems quite friendly.

876
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,460
My boys introduced me to him.

877
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,960
Dad.

878
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,740
This is Kyle.

879
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,460
He's our new dad.

880
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,140
My terrible boys introduced me to him.

881
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,860
He even responds to their call and comes to get food.

882
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,820
However, I wasn't comfortable with them interacting with him like that.

883
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,340
And I told them they couldn't feed him or go near him anymore as soon as they showed

884
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,220
him to me.

885
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,540
We are having quite a cold winter in Minnesota.

886
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,580
And in the past weeks, my terrible boys haven't been feeding him.

887
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,980
He has begun lingering in or near our yard.

888
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,380
He absolutely appears to be starving to death.

889
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,540
We will see him wheezing and growling outside.

890
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,860
Then a couple nights ago, my terrible boys decided to leave a carton of eggs and a two

891
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,780
pound bag of cheddar cheese on our porch because they want to give Kyle diarrhea forever.

892
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,740
They wanted him to make an omelet.

893
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,820
Which you can imagine he loved.

894
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
He did seem to go away for a couple of days.

895
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,620
Then yesterday-

896
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,740
While shitting himself.

897
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,820
Then yesterday, he got very aggressive with my wife, scaring her quite a bit and tearing

898
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,260
her insulated leggings.

899
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,620
I feel bad for the coyote.

900
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,120
What?

901
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,420
I feel bad for the coyote because it seems like he became reliant on the food from my

902
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,020
terrible sons during the winter.

903
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,900
And now he's in a situation where he didn't move to a location when he should have.

904
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,980
But I can't have a coyote attacking my family.

905
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,820
If I have to shoot him, I will do it.

906
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,780
But it feels wrong.

907
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,580
And it doesn't help that my terrible sons had given him a name, Kyle, and grown attached.

908
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,460
What should I do?

909
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,060
I added a lot of words to that question.

910
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,660
And normally I try to just preserve the work as it is in its native state.

911
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,060
But boy, when the shoe fits, wear it.

912
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,700
Can we all agree that at this point, coyote Kyle is trying to replace human Kenneth?

913
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,540
As the new, as coyote dad?

914
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,140
As coyote dad.

915
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,100
Like he approached the wife the only way he knows how.

916
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,740
He's been courting the two sons.

917
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,740
This is like that movie Daddy's Home, except with a coyote.

918
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,660
Or the movie Jack Frost, where Michael Keaton dies and becomes a snowman.

919
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,540
Kenneth, I guess he hasn't died yet, has he?

920
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,420
Well, he will if this coyote has his way.

921
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,100
I'll shoot him if he doesn't shoot me first.

922
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,980
It's basically exactly Octodad, except it's an octopus.

923
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,020
It's a coyote.

924
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,780
And instead of hilarious adventures, he eats everybody.

925
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,980
He eats all of them.

926
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,860
And he eats them.

927
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
And it takes 30 seconds.

928
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,020
It's a very short game in which you eat your whole family.

929
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,140
Here's a movie idea.

930
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,500
And it's about a coyote that wants to be the dad of a family.

931
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,860
But there's already a dad.

932
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,300
And this makes the coyote very sad.

933
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,340
And it's starving to death.

934
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,820
And the coyote is voiced by who's hot?

935
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,420
Who do people like love just hearing that?

936
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,140
Channing Tatum?

937
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,860
No, no, no, no.

938
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,020
The late night host guy, the British late night host guy

939
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,460
that was on that Doctor Who episode.

940
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,100
And he was sent into the woods.

941
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,740
James Corden.

942
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,340
James Corden?

943
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,980
Corden.

944
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,540
James Corden plays Kyle, the coyote.

945
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:15,380
A coyote who befriends two children, but their dick dad scares Kyle away.

946
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,100
And he goes in the woods.

947
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,060
And he's starving to death.

948
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,660
But a fucking fairy comes to him.

949
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,220
The guardian of the forest comes to him and says,

950
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,980
Kyle, I'll grant you one wish, and he says,

951
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,660
I just want to be the dad of this family.

952
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,380
And then the fairy bestows upon Kyle the power to go in

953
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,140
and eat this dad wholesale.

954
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,580
Just eat the dad wholesale.

955
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,980
But it's fine because he's the villain in the story

956
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,100
and everybody loves Kyle.

957
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,260
And then Kyle gets to be the dad of the family.

958
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,140
Sold.

959
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,020
But you are rooting.

960
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,700
Again, I have to state this.

961
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,940
You are rooting for Kyle because he's voiced

962
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,500
by a very affable James Corden.

963
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,700
Coming soon for Pixar.

964
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,900
Coming soon for Pixar.

965
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,860
Coyote Dad.

966
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,740
Coyote Get My Dad.

967
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,940
Coyote Get My Dad, dot, dot, dot.

968
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,780
But it's OK because he was an asshole.

969
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,340
I really wish I could have been there on the day

970
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,740
that the other coyotes went to warmer climes.

971
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,900
And Kyle's like, nah, nah, nah.

972
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,700
I got a fucking pretty dozen eggs waiting for me, bro.

973
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,980
I got it completely, completely set up here.

974
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,900
Do you have cheese at your warmer locale?

975
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,100
No, I didn't think so.

976
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,020
Guys, Bryce and Derek, they got me.

977
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
They are my bone thugs for life.

978
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,700
They got me.

979
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
They introduced me to their dad.

980
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,820
We're tied.

981
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,700
Stacks on stacks.

982
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,380
I want to be there at the introduction.

983
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,700
Kyle, Kenneth, Kenneth, Kyle, pleasure to meet you, sir.

984
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,380
Please don't come around my kids anymore.

985
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,100
What?

986
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,900
What?

987
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,460
Crazy about these boys, but Kenneth,

988
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,740
he left me a little cold.

989
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,140
One out of five would not meet again.

990
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,180
Would not dad again.

991
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,740
Kenneth, you say you want me to stay away from your sons,

992
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,540
but how are, do you know another way for coyotes

993
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,340
to get Dunkaroos?

994
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,980
Do you know of another way I met that I'm unfamiliar with?

995
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,860
This is the twist.

996
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,900
Asshole Kenneth doesn't want the kids to be around Kyle,

997
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
but he's also not there for the kids.

998
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,540
But Coyote Kyle is going to teach Asshole Kenneth

999
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,260
how to be a better dad when he drags him in the woods

1000
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,660
and keeps him in the woods for a couple of days.

1001
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,460
He's like, I'll show you how I interact with my family, Kenneth.

1002
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,140
And what does that entail?

1003
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,420
Just killing rabbits and bringing them home?

1004
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,620
Killing fowl and dragging rabbits back for his kids.

1005
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,980
And then Kenneth is like,

1006
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,140
I've never killed a rabbit for my kids.

1007
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,260
Kyle, you're the better dad.

1008
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,620
I've got to go on, I don't know,

1009
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,260
some kind of spiritual hike for several months.

1010
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,340
Please don't eat my wife while I'm gone.

1011
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,260
Do you think this is how that Revenant movie started

1012
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,660
when they were like blue sky in it?

1013
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,700
Is that what the film is called?

1014
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:36,740
Yes.

1015
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,020
I think it's called That Revenant Movie.

1016
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,500
That Revenant Movie and that Nosferatu did,

1017
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:50,180
and the original idea for the flick

1018
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,740
was a dad who befriends a coyote

1019
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,860
and he learns to be a better dad.

1020
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,980
And then at the end of the movie, of course,

1021
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,020
he has to kill the coyote just because nature,

1022
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,700
and then it says something about how humanity abuses nature.

1023
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,860
I'm still working on what the imaginary pitch would be,

1024
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,820
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1025
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,580
Man versus nature versus eggs.

1026
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,780
Then Leo rolled up and he's like,

1027
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,820
they are not going to give me the Oscar for this.

1028
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,580
They are not going to give me the Oscar for this.

1029
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,540
Make it a bear.

1030
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,260
Make it a bear.

1031
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,860
Step one.

1032
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,420
Step one, get rid of the talking of the bear.

1033
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,940
That's not going to do it for me.

1034
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,340
I have to be on it.

1035
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,180
I kill the bear in scene two.

1036
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,700
I adopt its cubs.

1037
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,060
Now I am the bear.

1038
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,340
This is better.

1039
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,400
Fuck.

1040
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Guys, why aren't we making movies?

1041
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,940
Being a bear dad is Oscar bait.

1042
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,060
Everyone knows that.

1043
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,380
Yeah.

1044
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:40,420
And being a dad named Oscar is bear bait.

1045
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,140
Shit.

1046
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,700
Science.

1047
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,340
How many fucking hearts of the ocean

1048
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,540
do the three of us fucking manufacture every episode

1049
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,860
that we then just like toss into the furnace saying like,

1050
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,740
ah, good joke.

1051
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,620
Bye, good idea.

1052
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,980
Into the furnace with you.

1053
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,900
And if we actually followed through with our fucking dreams

1054
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,420
for once, we would be the most successful entertainers

1055
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,020
in the world.

1056
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,260
Yeah.

1057
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,180
Coyote Dad coming to screens near you 2018.

1058
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,460
Maybe this is the time.

1059
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,860
Is this the one that we finally just buckle down

1060
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,740
and get it done?

1061
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,900
Well, we have to come with a better name than Coyote Dad.

1062
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,380
All the other stuff.

1063
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,580
Coyote Dad the musical.

1064
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,620
Dad Coyote Dad.

1065
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,700
Coyote Ugly.

1066
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,220
What about, why don't we just call it Kyle?

1067
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,660
Like if they can call a movie Carol,

1068
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,540
and it's like, what's it about?

1069
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,900
It's like, don't worry about it.

1070
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,300
I don't see why we can't just call our movie.

1071
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,380
Yeah, I don't see why I can't name our movie Kyle.

1072
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,300
And then we know at least one thing,

1073
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,980
every Kyle in the world is gonna go see it.

1074
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
And that's what, like 300,000 people?

1075
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,220
Finally, a movie for me.

1076
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,580
Yeah, they will say, and then they'll show up.

1077
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,820
And it'll actually be a story about like being a good dad

1078
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,180
and a good human, more importantly.

1079
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,140
And a good Kyle.

1080
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,700
And a good, well, yes.

1081
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,380
A good human, a great Kyle.

1082
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,020
That's the timeline.

1083
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,300
An okay coyote.

1084
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,740
Okay Coyote, the world's premier coyote dating site.

1085
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,940
Right next to it, right next to it.

1086
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,940
But where's all the coyotes in this bar?

1087
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,700
They're all online, chum.

1088
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,980
Okay Coyote is the second most popular coyote website

1089
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,660
in the world, right behind Dad Yelp,

1090
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,220
which is where coyotes leave reviews of dads

1091
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,140
for other coyotes to read.

1092
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,180
And also hook up.

1093
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,740
I met my wife on Dad Yelp.

1094
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,460
Kenneth, what's wrong?

1095
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,740
You're crying in front of your computer.

1096
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,820
Yeah, just logged on to Dad Yelp.

1097
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:24,100
And that coyote that our terrible sons have befriended,

1098
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,500
he has left some, frankly, some pretty wretched comments about me on here.

1099
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,140
I think I have to kill Kyle.

1100
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,820
I just want everyone to know that it's just occurred to me

1101
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,740
that when I picture Kyle underneath a rock out in the woods,

1102
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,860
I'm kind of picturing that shadow wolf from Neverending Story.

1103
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,260
Okay.

1104
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,940
Who's like the voice of the nothing.

1105
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,500
Yeah, sure.

1106
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,980
That's how I'm picturing Kyle, but still more charming than Kenneth.

1107
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,580
Yeah, fuck Kenneth for real though.

1108
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,780
Do you know how bad of a dad you have to be before your kids are like,

1109
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,780
here's our new dad, a coyote.

1110
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,580
A coyote?

1111
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,220
He'll do.

1112
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,300
He ate mom's insulated leggings.

1113
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,460
Yeah, he ate our mom's insulin and he's our new dad and we love him.

1114
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:03,940
What?

1115
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,180
How bad is your real dad?

1116
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,460
I do want to just shout out to my girl Amanda on Yahoo.

1117
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,500
17% best answers, not bad.

1118
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,940
Who says, call a zoo and ask for advice.

1119
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,660
Animal control will probably just result to violence.

1120
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,620
Pretty cool.

1121
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,900
Hi, zoo.

1122
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,260
Do you guys eat any coyotes?

1123
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,820
I've got a free coyote here.

1124
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,700
I've got a free coyote.

1125
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,740
Like you've captured one?

1126
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,500
Like I guess we could open up a coyote exhibit.

1127
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,380
No, I don't have it under, I don't like have it in hand.

1128
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,660
You guys would have to send your like wranglers for that.

1129
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,260
Now we're pitching a mouse hunt type movie where a hilarious like,

1130
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,740
you know, befuddled zookeeper shows up to help Kenneth catch Kyle,

1131
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,340
but Kyle cannot be caught.

1132
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,940
He is outsmarting them left and right while teaching the sons.

1133
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,140
I don't know about life.

1134
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:49,540
I don't know.

1135
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,580
But in the end, they all learn something from Kyle.

1136
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,100
Also, maybe he's magic.

1137
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,660
I don't know.

1138
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,220
We can focus group that later.

1139
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,340
Even animal control would be a bit of a stretch, right?

1140
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,620
Because he calls animal control.

1141
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,940
He's like, hi, Kyle the coyote.

1142
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,940
I don't know if you guys know him, but can you come kill him?

1143
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,980
What's he doing to you, sir?

1144
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,700
Well, nothing right now.

1145
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,660
But like earlier, he tore my wife's leggings.

1146
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,260
He taught my sons how to vape.

1147
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,660
And I really would like him to be killed, please.

1148
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:20,900
Really?

1149
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,620
Is he in your house?

1150
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,740
No, he's in the woods.

1151
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,100
If anything, I'm in his house.

1152
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,340
Yeah, he's in the woods like a regular coyote,

1153
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
but I just hate it when he comes around.

1154
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,140
I just hate knowing-

1155
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,940
Hey, animal control, could you come take my terrible children away?

1156
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,500
They keep luring coyotes to my house.

1157
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,700
I just hate knowing that he's out there somewhere thinking about-

1158
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,100
Kyle is out there putting the moves on my family and my house and everything.

1159
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,300
I'm trying to steal my-

1160
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,460
I have a, hi, I have a coyote who's doing identity theft to me

1161
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,900
and he's stealing my credit cards out of the like the shredded receipts

1162
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,100
out of there and put them back together.

1163
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,020
Kenneth, please stop calling.

1164
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,540
Hi, is this the number for animal control?

1165
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,980
Yes, Kenneth, what is it today?

1166
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,420
I was gonna make nachos to eat during the big game,

1167
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,020
but all the fucking ched's gone.

1168
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,340
Why is that even close to being our jurisdiction?

1169
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,780
I think it was two pounds.

1170
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,820
It was two fucking pounds.

1171
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,380
It was supposed to be all the ched I needed for the month.

1172
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,340
There's only one animal I know that can down that much ched.

1173
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,300
Oh God, no.

1174
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,100
No, no, no, no.

1175
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,060
That all like Kaiser Sose falls into place in his mind.

1176
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,500
He could just see Kyle putting all the pieces in place.

1177
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
You see four paws walking out of step

1178
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,740
and then they start like into a perfect prancing gallop

1179
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,980
and then you pan up a little bit

1180
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,220
and there's a big fur line cheesy mouth.

1181
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,860
And he's wearing sunglasses and he goes,

1182
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,260
hmm, nachos, cut to black.

1183
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,140
Fade to black.

1184
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,220
Fade to, no, don't fade, cut it, hard cut.

1185
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,980
Star wipe.

1186
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,540
No, not even star wipe, like nachos.

1187
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,300
Bam, a McElroy Brothers production.

1188
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,420
With some Guy Ritchie music.

1189
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,260
Fuck yeah, Guy Ritchie's band.

1190
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,460
Guy and the Family Richies.

1191
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,500
Rags to Richies.

1192
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,060
We're changing everything right now.

1193
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,740
Film, music.

1194
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,860
It's all on the fucking table.

1195
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,660
The world is ours, we just have to take it.

1196
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,340
Just have to reach out and take it.

1197
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,500
Rags to Richies is actually not a great idea

1198
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,580
because we would have to convince Guy Ritchie

1199
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,340
to start a family band.

1200
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,500
Yeah, and I don't like the movie is perfect.

1201
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,660
The movie is money in the bank.

1202
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,540
Rags to Richies is gonna be a tough sell.

1203
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,060
That's gonna be tough sell.

1204
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,780
But you do the movie to support Rags to Richies.

1205
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,660
I guess, yes.

1206
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,820
Sort of like, yeah, they form at the same time.

1207
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,820
Yeah, and you're driving business to Rags to Richies.

1208
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,980
Yeah, that's the secret to good business, is funneling.

1209
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,900
So what do we do now?

1210
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,180
I think we should end the show.

1211
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,260
Let's end the show, yeah, that's a great place to end.

1212
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,860
Hey, thank you all so much for listening to our program.

1213
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,500
Is everybody still recording, by the way?

1214
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,380
We didn't do a time check.

1215
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,940
Yeah, for sure.

1216
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,060
I wanna remind you to go to Nature Box,

1217
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,060

Yeah, they're so good.

1228
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,740
I wanna say, I'm very excited to announce,

1229
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,820
I teased it a little bit in the last couple of episodes,

1230
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,140
but my wife Teresa and I are launching

1231
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,820
a new podcast called Schmaners.

1232
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,820
And it's all about extraordinary etiquette

1233
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,940
for ordinary occasions and how manners are used

1234
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,020
in the modern world, how they still apply.

1235
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,220
We just put a promo up.

1236
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,100
If you'd like to check it out,

1237
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,020
you can go to bit.ly forward slash Schmaners promo,

1238
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,860
or you can follow us on Twitter at Schmaners cast.

1239
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,460
And I posted like the RSS feed and a direct download link

1240
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,700
for the promo if you're non iTunes user.

1241
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,100
I did wanna ask Travis, I listened to the pilot episode

1242
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,860
and are you gonna end every episode

1243
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,980
with you and Teresa having a burping contest?

1244
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,820
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to appeal

1245
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,780
to as much as to a wider audience as possible.

1246
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,860
It just doesn't seem mannerly to me, I guess.

1247
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,140
Okay, well, we're still working on it.

1248
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,100
So maybe we'll edit that out.

1249
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,940
I've gotta send it to Jesse for a couple last minutes.

1250
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,980
Sure, sure, sure.

1251
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,020
So maybe the 30 minute long burping contest will get cut.

1252
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,020
There was a lot, just like a lot of it.

1253
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,580
There was a lot.

1254
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,500
Yeah, and a lot of it was just like dry heaving.

1255
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,540
Yeah, it was really, really bad.

1256
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,820
But go check it out Schmaners at Schmaners cast

1257
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,180
or search for it on iTunes.

1258
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,620
I have some new projects.

1259
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,060
I have a new hit YouTube series called Griffin's Amiibo Corner

1260
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,700
where I put Nintendo brand Amiibo toys in my mouth

1261
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,500
and review them.

1262
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,940
I'm very proud of it.

1263
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,940
Just search YouTube for Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

1264
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,980
Justin and I do Monster Factory for Polygon,

1265
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,660
which we don't talk about a lot on the show,

1266
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,980
but is also I'm very proud of.

1267
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,900
I want you to know the latest episode

1268
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,060
and I won't give too much away,

1269
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,500
but when you're working on the face

1270
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,220
and you manipulate the mouth to make him talk,

1271
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,500
I was crying.

1272
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,300
Oh, good.

1273
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,700
Like I had a hard time breathing for the entirety of that.

1274
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,340
Thank you very much.

1275
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,780
Me and my wife Rachel have a Bachelor fancast

1276
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,900
called Rose Buddies.

1277
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,900
I'm gonna try and get an official podcast feed up for that,

1278
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,260
but right now they're up on SoundCloud.

1279
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,500
You can find that on SoundCloud.

1280
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,100
And I should be launching a new video game podcast this week

1281
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,020
with Polygon's Nick Robinson

1282
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,260
that I'm also really happy about.

1283
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,460
Might be next week on that one,

1284
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,820
but I'll let you know when it goes up.

1285
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,380
What's it called?

1286
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,500
I don't want to say.

1287
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:28,980
Okay.

1288
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,620
It's a really good one.

1289
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,220
It's a really great promo, Griffin.

1290
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,540
It's called

1291
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,220
Okay.

1292
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,740
I guess that's work it took to get to that point.

1293
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:38,900
Yeah.

1294
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,580
No, a ridiculous amount of work to get to.

1295
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,340
All right.

1296
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,060
That's going to do.

1297
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,740
Justin, do you have anything you want to plug?

1298
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:44,980
No.

1299
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,100
My baby.

1300
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,900
What about Sawbones?

1301
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,940
My baby's doing great.

1302
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,540
Sawbones is a medical history podcast

1303
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,380
that I make with my wife, Sydney.

1304
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,340
It is, you will learn something and you'll laugh

1305
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,460
and you'll laugh and learn.

1306
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,580
Our new episode is about green sickness,

1307
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,860
which is sort of like anemia,

1308
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,820
except it's fake.

1309
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,580
Okay, cool.

1310
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,300
It's a great app.

1311
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,820
So check that out.

1312
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,140
Sawbones on iTunes or at Sawbones on Twitter

1313
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,700
or what have you.

1314
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,380
I want to say thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

1315
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,900
for using our theme song, It's a Departure.

1316
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,660
Off the album, putting the days to bed.

1317
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,540
Terrific album.

1318
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,220
Always great for a listen.

1319
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,980
Any time of year, any mood,

1320
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,500
any feeling you're trying to capture,

1321
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,700
this album has it all.

1322
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,860
Also want to say a genuine thanks to Lin Manuel Miranda,

1323
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,980
who has turned the My Brother, My Brother,

1324
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,420
and Me Appreciation group on Facebook

1325
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,660
into just a nonstop fucking screaming, hilarious party.

1326
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,460
Yeah, if you are not on that Facebook group,

1327
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,500
you need to get there.

1328
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,460
Search for My Brother, My Brother,

1329
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,740
and Me Appreciation group.

1330
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,580
Just a quick note to people on there.

1331
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,860
We, just so you know,

1332
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,460
like when you try to put things on there

1333
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,500
and they don't appear,

1334
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,420
we're fairly stringent with like,

1335
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,460
like we had two posts this week

1336
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,020
that were videos of Tyra Banks

1337
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,660
and Carly Rae Jepsen saying hi to Griffin.

1338
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,740
So like, we try to keep a pretty high bar there.

1339
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,580
So if you notice that you're like putting things

1340
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,580
and it's not, they're just not going through,

1341
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,060
it's probably because we're not letting them through.

1342
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,740
Cause we're pretty, we're pretty strict about

1343
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,460
what we put up on that.

1344
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,380
What Justin is saying is find a celebrity

1345
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,700
and get them to reference our show in some way

1346
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,660
and then you'll make the cut.

1347
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,820
And like A-list please.

1348
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,100
A-list please.

1349
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,860
And please don't just fucking

1350
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,900
find a picture of a horse and say like,

1351
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,420
I know who loves horses.

1352
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:22,980
Stop it.

1353
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,460
We do love, like we do love horses.

1354
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,420
We do love horses,

1355
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,940
but we already have all those pictures.

1356
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,860
Print it out and paste it all over our room

1357
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,980
like serial killers.

1358
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,220
Yeah.

1359
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,060
All right.

1360
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,580
So y'all want the final yahoo?

1361
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,980
Hit me.

1362
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,140
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1363
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,940
Climbing that ladder.

1364
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,580
Thank you, Zoe.

1365
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,300
It's also sent in,

1366
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,620
I did a Google search or a Gmail search for it.

1367
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,340
It's also sent in by Russell Troyer like a month ago

1368
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,300
and I just missed it.

1369
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:47,780
Weird.

1370
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,980
Thank you to both of you.

1371
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,660
It's a smash hit.

1372
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,620
It's from Roxie's girl who asks,

1373
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,660
army wife or Arby's wife.

1374
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,860
I'm Justin McElroy.

1375
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,220
I'm Travis McElroy.

1376
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,140
I'm, oh fuck.

1377
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,620
What was it?

1378
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,260
Bliss Delight.

1379
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,900
Thank you for listening to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1380
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:21,940
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1381
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,100
We have today.

1382
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,740
It's like the line I know it's on a favorite album,

1383
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,060
but for everything in culture.

1384
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,860
It makes me happy to hear music I've never heard before.

1385
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,260
Voices I'd never thought to listen to

1386
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,540
and culture recommendations that are outside my comfort zone.

1387
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,900
That's why I listen to Bullseye.

1388
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,660
You should too.

1389
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,500
Bullseye's your guide to what's good

1390
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:11,300
for Maximum Fund.org and NPR.
