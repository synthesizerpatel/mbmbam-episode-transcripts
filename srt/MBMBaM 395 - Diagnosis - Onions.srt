1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice from the modern era.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your miller's brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,320
Oh god, this is so loud. And I, should I not?

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,040
Just bring it down. I don't have to do mine, like people know who I am and the heat that I bring,

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,680
but I am the- Just do it, just like bring it down.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,680
I'm the sweet baby, Griffin. I wanna talk about, I had a kid.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
What? I wanna talk about that.

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,720
I wanna talk about that for a second. Well, but see, I also had an important

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,480
life event happen, I went on a cruise, and now I wanna talk about that.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,200
Well that's funny, because I had one I wanted to talk about.

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,840
I started going to basketball camp, I don't have anything.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,440
I started going to basketball camp, and I didn't though, but that's a lie,

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,200
but I just wanted to have one. I think I could be the impartial sort of third

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
party here trying to decide of what's gonna be the better intro.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Justin having another beautiful, beautiful child, or Travis having a second child,

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,200
so to speak, that is the boat. The sea, his love of the ocean.

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah, it's his second child. Let me think about this.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Let me consider possibilities. Jokes for Justin's.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,120
Very sleepy, we probably got a lot of doo-doo humor,

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,320
although I will say we could probably get some doo-doo humor out of the boat one too.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,000
I, this kid is just shitting all the time. Listen, guys-

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
Now to be fair, after my time on the boat, I was also shitting all the time.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,880
Yeah, and Justin, I'm gonna have to stop you, because I haven't made a call yet.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,720
I got a way that it's, if we're talking doo-doo humor versus doo-doo humor,

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
it sounds like I gotta figure out which one's gonna be the richest vein,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
and I'm leaning towards boat. I'm leaning towards a boat over child.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,960
What I love about that is that I don't have to talk.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,520
The onus is removed from me to have a great bit about fatherhood,

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,160
which honestly, the mind, here's one that dads won't say.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
Say, honey, if you're listening to this in the future, Cooper,

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
daddy's gonna brag on you a little bit, and you're probably gonna be embarrassed,

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,600
so skip ahead a few minutes. Are you done listening?

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay, good. What have I done?

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,840
Yeah.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
I've made such a massive error in judgment.

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,760
There's two.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
I already had a child, so I had that life experience.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't know why I thought, what was I trying to prove?

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
You ticked that box, Justin.

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't know who I was trying to prove something.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,480
Why did you go back?

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
Yeah, the box was done ticked.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
I guess I wanted one in reserve.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
You know, a burner, kid, just in case.

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,760
Jesus.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,200
I don't know why I thought I could do this again.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm an old man.

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
You know, that's so funny you mentioned that, Justin.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,880
I felt the same way whenever I'd go back to the buffet

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,440
and get a second plate of food, and it's like, what am I even doing?

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,560
Oh, on the boat?

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Yeah, why did I go back?

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
I've already eaten enough food, you know?

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
And then you're finished like, oh, why did I do that?

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
I love the boat humor.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,200
At basketball camp, Dr. Jeremy Dunks, who's the camp counselor,

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
taught us all jumping.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,040
I think it's boats.

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
I think it's boats.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
I think it might be boats.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Boats, yes.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,040
So Captain Travis, how-

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,880
It's actually Commodore.

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,400
Commodore, Travis, how were the high seas?

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,960
It's actually Commodore, Ron Jemen, Jay Meriwether, gentlemen, privateer.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,320
That's nothing.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm just going to call you Captain Trav.

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
The J stands for Joshua now.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,760
How was the waves and the whales and all the fish and-

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,400
The ship was a rockin' and a rollin'.

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Can I sleep?

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
For this part, I did have a long con kind of cookup

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
where I was going to tell my wife, oh, we got a long sesh today,

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,640
recording for two hours, trying to get one in the can

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,040
and then take a nap on the floor of my office.

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,760
That was kind of one scam I was sort of thinking about running.

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Well, Justin, I'm going to give you a ticket

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,760
and it's for 90 seconds of sleepy time

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,160
and something tells me you're going to use each and every one of them.

87
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,200
So you go ahead and do that

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,080
and Travis is going to tell me all of his fun boat adventures.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Can he guarantee before you give him that permission slip

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,760
that something funny did happen on the boat?

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,120
Several funny things happened.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Thank you for asking.

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, now is this just going to be you bragging

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,560
about how you met all the hot stars?

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Yes.

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Well, then I'm not interested in that anymore.

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
No, but it'll be interesting though also.

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
Well, no, you're just going to drop a bunch of names

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
and now I'm wondering if maybe me and Justin

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,280
should overrule you and go to basketball camp.

101
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
Well, let me try this one on for size

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,640
and this will give you a kind of a taste of my stories.

103
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,000
Do I still get the nap with the basketball camp?

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes, Justin, absolutely.

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay.

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
The first day I was having a conversation with Wil Wheaton.

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
Okay, see, and you were fucking four seconds in.

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
Well, you made me a promise.

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
On the first day I was having a conversation with someone.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
But I know who it is.

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,920
You already said-

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
Someone from Star Trek.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
Someone from Star Trek and Big Bang Theory

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,880
and Tabletop on YouTube and Keegan Sundry.

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,200
And we're just casually on the ground

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
and this person just casually gestures towards the water

118
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
and goes, there's a whale.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,920
And it was very bizarre

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
and not a moment you expect to ever have in your life.

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,920
Just randomly having a conversation

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,760
and then like there's a whale

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,840
and swimming with the whale with some dolphins

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,920
and it was fucking magical.

125
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
And this person turned to this whale

126
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,800
and did this bokkan and said, live long and prosper.

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
But I can't say who it is.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
Can't say who it is.

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
Cannot say who it was.

130
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
That's funny.

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
When I was at basketball camp,

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
my bunkmate was Wharf.

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,960
So it sounds like we all had our own

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
little sort of great experiences there.

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,680
We all had our own fun.

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
There was also a day where we walked into

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
one of the lounge areas

138
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
and the crew, having a bit of fun,

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
had made a bunch of towel animals in the area

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,520
but it was all the monkeys that hang from coat hangers.

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,200
And I don't think it was a lovely gesture.

142
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
I love that they did it.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm not complaining about that.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,000
But I don't know if they were trying to be unsettling

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
but it definitely was.

146
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,040
If Travis was worried that his cruise chat

147
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,440
would be alienating to many of our listeners,

148
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm glad that he has graduated to complaining

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,480
about the available towel animals.

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
Anyways, the JoCo Cruise was great

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,200
and JoCo Cruise 2019 is already available for booking.

152
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,040
So we'll get on that.

153
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
They Might Be Giants is gonna be there

154
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,480
and I'm not even being paid to plug

155
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
and it's not even guaranteed

156
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,040
that I'll be on it again next year.

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm just a big fan of it and it was really great.

158
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
And you should go do it.

159
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,640
Based on the story you're telling

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,560
of how you yelled at a bunch of whales with someone.

161
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,120
With someone.

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
We didn't yell at the whales.

163
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
We gestured towards them.

164
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
I think I know how Bill Beaton operates

165
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
and you two were definitely just yelling obscenities

166
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,880
at the whales.

167
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Justin, what about the birth?

168
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Was Worf there?

169
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes, carve the flesh.

170
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,720
Retrieve the new child.

171
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,640
Fight me.

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
Fight your way out of the woman child.

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
Get the baby a battle.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,400
Should we do-

175
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Carve his way out.

176
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,160
Let's do questions.

177
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,440
Yeah.

178
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
Oh, hell yeah.

179
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah, I got a question.

180
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,200
What did I do?

181
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Yeah, should we mention the fact

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,680
that Justin is operating on no hours of sleep

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
and that is why we are getting

184
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,120
this sort of fatalistic version?

185
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
The last one slept.

186
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Yeah.

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
For sure.

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
But now that last one, Justin is old enough to be like,

189
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
hey, what's up everybody?

190
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
And you also have a new one that doesn't wanna sleep.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,440
No, the new one is, the old one's like very chill

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,760
and sleeping through the night in her own bed.

194
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,320
It's amazing.

195
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
She's a gift and a treasure

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
and I didn't appreciate her enough.

197
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,960
This new one just shits and then it yells about it

198
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,120
and when my last baby, Charlie, cried,

199
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,800
it was so pitiful.

200
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,760
It was like, oh man, I gotta do something.

201
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,000
When Cooper cries, it sounds like she's praying

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
to an elder god for the strength to kill us.

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,240
Just like, please give me the strength

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,360
to smite these idiots.

205
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
Yeah, sounds like-

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,720
Hell yeah.

207
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Suck the kids.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
Sounds like maybe she's succeeding.

209
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Yes, well, slowly, not that slowly, but I teach some great English.

210
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
Can we start with the third question here?

211
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,520
Cause I can't wait to get to it.

212
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
No, that's why I put it as third.

214
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
Cause here's the thing.

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Can I pull back the curtain a little bit here

216
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
on episode 395?

217
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
On every week, I pick out six questions

218
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,840
knowing we only ever get to three.

219
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,640
I don't know why I continue to do six,

220
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
but I guarantee if I just drop three on you two,

221
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
you'd be like, wait, what?

222
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,120
Where's the other?

223
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,840
And so like, my third question is,

224
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,680
oh, that's the club banger that's like-

225
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,840
I know, but we need to get Justin hyphy

226
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,560
and I feel like this question's gonna be the one that does it.

227
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,680
I'm a consummate professional.

228
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
When we start recording, I'm gonna be on.

229
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
There's no more complaining about-

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
Justin, we've been recording for the last 10 minutes.

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah, for a while.

232
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
Well then, here it comes.

233
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
Pull up your baseball gloves,

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
cause I got a hot pitch coming in.

235
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,340
Perfect.

236
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,820
My husband's name is Tim Allen.

237
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,060
Yes, like the actor.

238
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,100
Most of the time when we place a pickup order of some kind,

239
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,900
we use his name.

240
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,100
However, almost every time we go to the store

241
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,820
to pick up the item,

242
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,180
the cashier generally says,

243
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,540
oh, like the tool man, right?

244
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,500
Do you guys get that all the time?

245
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,220
Do they do that in 2017-18?

246
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,420
Oh, fuck my life.

247
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,620
To which end up responding kindly?

248
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes, yes we do.

249
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,380
Is there a better way to respond to these cashiers

250
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,580
who always think they're the first one

251
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,260
to make the joke about Tim Allen?

252
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,420
How do I tell them to stuff it?

253
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,780
I've already heard that one.

254
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,620
Without being overly rude.

255
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,860
That's from over it in Ohio.

256
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,700
I think the best way is just to say like,

257
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,980
wait, who?

258
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,700
And make them explain it.

259
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Make them explain who Tim Allen is.

260
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,260
Make them do a bullet point by bullet point

261
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,060
plot recap of the entirety of Home Improvement.

262
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,860
What, wait, what?

263
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,620
His neighbors behind a fence

264
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,980
and then different objects.

265
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,060
You know, what is this show?

266
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,100
Why don't you see his face?

267
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,900
I don't understand.

268
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,860
What's going on?

269
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,740
And then the thing he was building just like explodes

270
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,340
and he dies, I assume?

271
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,700
No, he doesn't die.

272
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,460
But they keep letting him make things?

273
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:03,940
What?

274
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,980
What are you talking about?

275
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,820
Tell me more about the clown man, Al Borland.

276
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,420
I want to dial into the clown man.

277
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,540
In the future, when you see them again,

278
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,220
ask them for updates.

279
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,500
Ask how things are going.

280
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,420
Tell me about the new Home Improvement.

281
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,060
Tell me about the new Home Improvement that there is.

282
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,700
And then when there is no more new Home Improvement,

283
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,380
make them create new Home Improvement.

284
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,940
There it is.

285
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,540
What do you think they did after the finale

286
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,980
and then just keep going from there?

287
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,260
Speculative fan fiction and also my chilis to go.

288
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,140
Thank you.

289
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,100
I need both.

290
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,860
And maybe your parents should have thought about this

291
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,340
before they fucking tried to steal Tim Allen's identity.

292
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,180
Thank you, Griffin.

293
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,620
Just saying.

294
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,900
Anytime a parent names a child the same thing

295
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
as another person in the world,

296
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,820
it is identity theft.

297
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,060
And we gotta just, we gotta,

298
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,300
nobody's talking about this in the media,

299
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,980
the mainstream media, the lamestream media.

300
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,620
Okay, so Home Improvement started in 1991, right?

301
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,300
It's 2018.

302
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,420
So it's very possible.

303
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,980
I mean, the question doesn't say how old the husband is,

304
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,140
but if it's, it could be if the husband is what,

305
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,620
20, no, I'm not doing math correctly.

306
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,060
How old would this person be?

307
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,100
Yeah, 27, right?

308
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,580
69.

309
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,220
69, nice.

310
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,860
But if they're 27 or younger,

311
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,300
then it's very possible, yes,

312
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,820
like the tool man is the correct answer to that question.

313
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,020
I was named for the tool man.

314
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,940
Yes, I was named for the tool man.

315
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,900
I was named in honor of the tool man, my godfather.

316
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,220
Could you say that, yes, that's me,

317
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,460
Tim Allen from television.

318
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,300
It's been a weird few years, but I am Tim Allen now.

319
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,980
It's me, Tim Allen from Michigan.

320
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,780
I have been passed on the mantle.

321
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,500
I killed the last Tim Allen, and now I am Tim Allen.

322
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,180
And I look like him, no matter what I do,

323
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,700
I wake up every morning looking exactly like him, Tim Allen.

324
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,820
Why does Buzz sound so different in Toy Story 4?

325
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,700
Oh, you didn't hear.

326
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,620
The Tim Allen was murdered.

327
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,020
There's a new Tim Allen now.

328
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,380
Now there is a new tool man.

329
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,460
His name is Tim Allen.

330
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
He also hates the Al Borland clown.

331
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,140
Of course we're on the fourth Al Borland.

332
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,100
It's worth noting.

333
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,180
Should we mention that Tim Allen sucks?

334
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,900
We haven't really talked about that yet.

335
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,500
Well, I feel like we make jokes about people who are stinkers,

336
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,460
and then people are like,

337
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,540
hey, did you know that this person's a stinker?

338
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,700
And the answer to that is yes.

339
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,580
That's why we're punching up at Tim Allen.

340
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,660
Yeah, so we can make jokes about him

341
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,380
as long as we include a disclaimer that he sucks shit.

342
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,260
You always go super hard.

343
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,260
Travis, correct me if I'm wrong,

344
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,460
but do you feel like,

345
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm not saying that Tim Allen sucks or doesn't suck, he does,

346
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,980
but don't you feel like Griffin goes kind of like

347
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,620
an incommensurate level of hard at Tim Allen

348
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,140
whenever Tim Allen comes up?

349
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,500
It feels very personal.

350
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,140
No, I get that because I think Tim Allen was,

351
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,900
as we all know, a huge hero of Griffin's for a long time,

352
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,540
and then when it was revealed that Tim Allen sucked,

353
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,340
I think it really hit Griffin in a pretty hard way.

354
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,060
I think for Griffin, it is a good person.

355
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,180
I mean, you knew me.

356
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,620
I was going down the street.

357
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,740
I was going to Blockbuster,

358
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,300
and I would say, let me Brent Joe versus the Volcano.

359
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,500
Let me get my, yeah, he was in that one, wasn't he?

360
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,620
Or was that Tom Hanks?

361
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,740
That was Tom Hanks, who rules for now, currently rules.

362
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,380
I was talking about Jungle 2 Jungle,

363
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,300
the Santa Claus, Santa Claus 1, 2, 3, all of them,

364
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,860
and I had my t-shirt that says Tim Allen does it.

365
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,660
Tim Allen's good.

366
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,700
Tim Allen is good.

367
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:10,980
And then he comes out and he calls me a snowflake

368
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,700
and said that I personally got his bad show canceled,

369
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,580
and I don't know how to respond to that

370
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,220
except to go on my podcast and say, well, Tim Allen is not good.

371
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,140
And in fact, he might suck shit.

372
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,060
So what if I couch it like that?

373
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,820
And he might suck shit?

374
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
Tim, no, I'll say this.

375
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,460
Tim Allen is not good.

376
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,500
He may suck shit.

377
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,980
He's in a quantum state.

378
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,860
He could be sucking shit or he could not be sucking shit,

379
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,660
and until we observe him, we will not know.

380
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,860
What I love about that is that that is not a very PC thing to say,

381
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,180
and so I think the man himself, the tool man,

382
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,100
the former tool man would appreciate it.

383
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,980
So did you know that the name of the Home Improvement theme

384
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,300
is Iron John's Rock and not just the theme of Home Improvement?

385
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,020
Fuck, Travis.

386
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,740
Pure Michigan.

387
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,860
Why did they name the theme?

388
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,340
And for the life of me, I've been sitting here Googling furiously.

389
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,820
I can't find out if it was called Iron John's Rock

390
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,980
and then they used it for Home Improvement

391
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,380
or if someone wrote the theme song to Home Improvement

392
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,860
and said I'm also going to give it a title.

393
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,100
Yeah, well, I've just written my 30-second long macadam opus.

394
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,940
It's a shame no one's ever going to hear it.

395
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,020
Who listens to 30-second songs anyway?

396
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I have a Yahoo here and this one sent me down a real deep oubliette

397
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,460
and so I wanted to invite you guys down in the oubliette with me.

398
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,980
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles and it's Yahoo Answers user Johnny who asked,

399
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,900
in a real-life situation, can firefighter really pee on a small fire to get it out?

400
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,980
And then, because game shows, you can't believe.

401
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,500
Wait.

402
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,580
I saw this and I was like, what the fuck is this person talking about?

403
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,980
This is, this is nonsense.

404
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,220
And then I kept going down the submissions

405
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,780
and I found one that was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson.

406
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,980
It's from Yahoo Answers user Johnny who asks again,

407
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,860
family feud question, name something a firefighter do to put out small fire.

408
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,860
That was question, the answer was pee, how is that possible?

409
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,380
So it seems like on the feud, there was this, there was a thing, a category

410
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,780
about things firefighters do to put out fires.

411
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,860
And that's probably, Steve probably got to, what can a firefighter do to,

412
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,140
what can a firefighter do to, and then one of the, you know,

413
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:57,220
goblins that goes on that show just screams like, piss, Steve, like waiting for, piss, Steve, piss.

414
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,340
Steve, they can piss on it.

415
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,900
I want to say piss on TV, Steve, piss.

416
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,420
And then he points to the board and it probably said something like wee-wee water.

417
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,380
They can fart on it real hard, Steve.

418
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,940
You fart on it?

419
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,020
No, I'm sorry, that would actually make the fire bigger.

420
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,180
The fire has sex with it.

421
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,980
The fire?

422
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,620
What is wrong with everyone on this show?

423
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,580
Making whoopee.

424
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,860
They can make whoopee with the fire, Steve.

425
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,340
Let's see, 56%.

426
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,940
So it pops up on the board and it says like asparagus.

427
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,620
Pops up on the board.

428
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,100
And it says like asparagus juice, human.

429
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,460
Asparagus juice.

430
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,300
And then it shows up there and is the right answer.

431
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,860
And I'm wondering if that's based, I never saw Backdraft.

432
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,620
I never saw Fireproof, the Kirk Cameron sort of religious vehicle.

433
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,740
And I'm wondering if there's a scene in either,

434
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,020
how did this sort of get injected into the public eye, the public consciousness?

435
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,580
That if there was a very small fire, when you're a firefighter, you don't just-

436
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,140
How small?

437
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,980
Like a match?

438
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,460
Yeah, I mean, if you're a firefighter and you see a small fire,

439
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,780
I think you know that that can turn into a big fire

440
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,180
and that can be a big, dangerous situation.

441
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,300
And so you see a small one, you go out to a fancy restaurant,

442
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,060
and there's a bunch of lit candles all over the place.

443
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,900
And you're like, ugh, God, not again.

444
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,860
Wee-wee water, does it happen then?

445
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,660
Probably not.

446
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,580
Here's the thing, you're looking at two different,

447
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,700
two different questions really, Griffin, because can it, right?

448
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,140
So there has to be a window of size of fire

449
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,500
where it's too big to stamp out,

450
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,100
but small enough that you think a bladder full

451
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
could accomplish the task.

452
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,180
And I do think you could find that window.

453
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,340
But I think the other side of the question is,

454
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,300
is there a flap of sorts?

455
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,820
Is there some kind of mechanism in the fire person suit

456
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
that would even allow for such a thing?

457
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,980
Yeah, that's a great question, Travis.

458
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,420
Thank you, thank you, Travis.

459
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,260
I hadn't even considered that part of it.

460
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,220
But the answer is yes.

461
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,260
There's a little fireproof flap, kind of like how

462
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,140
old-timey kids had it on the back of their pajamas.

463
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,500
Hey, was that for shitting?

464
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,020
Yes.

465
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,620
Yeah, it was for shitting.

466
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
What else would that be for, Griffin?

467
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,820
Like, cute.

468
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,780
Tattooing?

469
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,900
No, like cute.

470
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,700
Like, uh-oh, my hiner, they would say, in old-timey terms.

471
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,540
So is it possible that this is not the most efficient way?

472
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
I mean, I can't envision a situation where it's like,

473
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,980
oh no, my hiner is not the most efficient way.

474
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,700
Um, extinguisher tank is empty, the hose got all tangled up,

475
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,340
and there's a, there's still a small fire remaining.

476
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,540
Oh, I know how to do water with my body.

477
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll cry on it.

478
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,060
And then somebody's like, no, no, no, there's a better way.

479
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,220
I think that there's a third question here.

480
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,380
If, if, if, do you think that this is a,

481
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,620
like, leave your badge and, like, fire axe on my desk,

482
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,740
your loose cannon, um, you know,

483
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,420
we can't have you on the force.

484
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,340
Because of your, because of your loose cannon.

485
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah, so, get out of here.

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,660
But then, like, later in the day,

487
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,460
they're in a fire and all of their extinguishers are empty,

488
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,260
and they're like, if only they were here,

489
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,580
and that person then just pees all over everything

490
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,860
and saves the day.

491
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,420
If only that pervert was still here.

492
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,540
Here's the thing, maybe the firefighters want to piss

493
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,900
on the fire, because they, they probably hate this hot stuff,

494
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,180
hot stuff so much.

495
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,780
They hate this hot air, which is all fire is.

496
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,940
It's air that got too hot and burned it up.

497
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,140
And they hate it so much that I think they probably do try

498
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,540
as much as they can to put out the fire,

499
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,820
except for one last bit.

500
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,700
Especially the brave firefighters who go out

501
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,540
into, like, the wildfire situations.

502
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,340
And, and they, you know, they finally contain it,

503
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,540
and it takes, like, two weeks,

504
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,860
and it's a costly, like, horrible, horrible thing.

505
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,620
I think at that point, if I was a firefighter

506
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,940
and I found the last little bit of fire

507
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
from this big wildfire, I'd be like,

508
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,940
all right, motherfucker, time to put you down.

509
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,580
And then, and I'm not making jokes,

510
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,020
it's a horrible thing, but, like,

511
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,420
I think I would be very, very angry at the fire.

512
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,060
And I think I'd want to put it out.

513
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,220
What if the fire was, what if it was so hot,

514
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,340
they'll go from, like, it boiled the pee back up,

515
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,900
so it's like the fire's fighting back.

516
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,180
Come on, Travis.

517
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,060
No, that, so you think it's more of a finishing move.

518
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,660
Would it make it better if you took this small little bit

519
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,620
of fire that was left, and you put it in the toilet,

520
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,420
and then-

521
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,700
And then you peed on it?

522
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,500
Yeah.

523
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,700
Yeah, I think that would be better.

524
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,380
I think that there should be a rule

525
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,340
in the Fire Person Code of Conduct that's just, like,

526
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,580
you can do this if you need, if you also need to pee.

527
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,020
Like, don't do it just cause.

528
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,740
Don't do it just to showboat.

529
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,340
How would you do it if you didn't need to pee?

530
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,620
Well, it's-

531
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,860
Just stand there and pound a bottle of water,

532
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,140
like, hold on.

533
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,300
Listen, we're getting into the honor system at this point,

534
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,980
yes, but I think, like-

535
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,300
This is taboo, but you just squeeze it real hard.

536
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,020
This is taboo.

537
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,300
This is podcast taboo.

538
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,460
They won't talk about this on, you know, WTF

539
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,420
or Comedy Bang Bang, but you just squeeze it real hard.

540
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,820
Maybe it's like they make all the firefighters

541
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,180
go to the bathroom before the alarm starts,

542
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,820
and they're like, okay, everybody go to the bathroom now,

543
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,380
cause once we get there, there's not gonna be a bathroom.

544
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,260
Oh God, Travis, you just gave me a wave of anxiety.

545
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,420
My whole life is based around like knowing

546
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,780
that I'll be able to go to a place

547
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,380
and not have to worry about the bathroom there

548
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,340
and like timing it out.

549
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,300
If I had a job that was like a bell rung

550
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,780
and I had 45 seconds to put on essentially,

551
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
you know, plate mail armor

552
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
and then rush to the place I was going to,

553
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,100
if I didn't have a chance to do my thing,

554
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,020
oh my God, no.

555
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,900
This is not the job for me for so many reasons.

556
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,620
I bet that happened with, you mentioned plate mail.

557
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,420
I bet there's a lot, like about half the time

558
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,220
after your squire got you all dressed up as a knight,

559
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,180
I bet you were like, oh.

560
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,980
Oh man.

561
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,500
Especially when you're jousting,

562
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,820
you get hit while you're jousting, you're like, oh man.

563
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,300
There it goes.

564
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Tamerlane.

565
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,460
Unstrap me.

566
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,140
How about another question?

567
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,500
Cause we've talked about piss.

568
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,020
We can't do piss again for about 13 more.

569
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,340
We talked about poop at the beginning too, so.

570
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,580
Oh man, can we do the Tim Allen one again?

571
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,140
Wait, did you just sample Iron John's rock?

572
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah, no, I owe it a thousand dollars.

573
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,860
Sorry, Iron John.

574
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,460
I owe you a bunch of money now.

575
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
The person who wrote the song isn't named John.

576
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,220
I also want to make that very clear.

577
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,700
Well then what's the point?

578
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,460
I have no fucking clue.

579
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,420
Why did they call it that?

580
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,820
Why didn't they call it the Tim the Tool Man's tune?

581
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
The Ballad of No.

582
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,860
Toolin' Around.

583
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Toolin' Around would be a great name for a song.

584
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
You think it would be a great name for a song.

585
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,820
I work in a small office of about 10 people.

586
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,460
My boss is always walking around,

587
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,700
commenting on everyone's lunches.

588
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Like, wow, what's that?

589
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,220
PB&J?

590
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,260
Nice, classic.

591
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,660
Let me get a closer look at that.

592
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:02,980
Nice.

593
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,740
He will swing by your desk if you get subway

594
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,100
and ask you about every ingredient.

595
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Like, did you get onions on that thing?

596
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,820
Wow, nice.

597
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,820
I appreciate how positive he is about it though.

598
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,460
Yeah.

599
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,380
I know this sounds like a minor inconvenience,

600
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,420
but it's so awkward and embarrassing and weird.

601
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,500
And it's a harsh encroachment of my

602
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,100
only 20 minutes I get to myself.

603
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Any advice is appreciated, Cool Brothers.

604
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,580
That's from Just Trying to Eat in Manhattan.

605
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,140
This is horrible.

606
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,780
That's rough.

607
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,580
This is so hard to answer because I also, on some level,

608
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,860
really kind of sympathize with the boss.

609
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,140
Because it's like, clearly this boss is not great at small talk.

610
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,220
When your small talk includes,

611
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,980
did you get onions on that?

612
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,460
Nice.

613
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,140
Like, you're not, you're bunting right there.

614
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,180
That's small talk bunting.

615
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,740
Right.

616
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,780
And I get that.

617
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,340
I do that all the time.

618
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,780
He didn't have anything to add about onions.

619
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,180
He didn't have any great observations about onions.

620
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,980
Yeah.

621
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,940
You're gonna need to start bringing in a little pup tent

622
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,180
to work that you crack open.

623
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,860
And then that's your little Christopher Robin hidey hole.

624
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,060
And nobody's allowed to go in there

625
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,100
when you're eating your lunch.

626
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,180
Don't come in with a lunch tent.

627
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,820
You're not allowed in the lunch tent.

628
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,940
This is where I do lunch.

629
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,220
If that's too big a burden,

630
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,700
maybe just cover yourself up with a big blanket while you eat.

631
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,580
Or go hide in the bathroom

632
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,780
and have a sandwich on the toilet or something.

633
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,660
Because this fills me with so much dread.

634
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,540
Like, this is such a precious time in my life.

635
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,980
And the last thing I need is spectators for the Onion Show.

636
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,420
It's so bad.

637
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,820
Yeah, it's also a lot of pressure to then have to explain

638
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,900
the ingredients you got on your Subway sandwich.

639
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,060
A thing that you hope never gets asked.

640
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,860
Please don't ask me.

641
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,700
Because I don't have a good answer

642
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,020
for why I said yes, tomatoes.

643
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,900
I just wanted them.

644
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,180
Yeah, sometimes I'll get green peppers and sometimes I won't.

645
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,500
Yeah.

646
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,060
And I don't want to have to delve deep into why.

647
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,180
It's just like,

648
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,900
I think you're not gonna get out of the situation unless you hide.

649
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,340
And if you don't want to hide during your lunchtime,

650
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,380
because it's our God-given right,

651
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,500
according to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,

652
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,220
then I think you got to limit the number of ingredients

653
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,260
in the lunch that you eat.

654
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,140
And maybe you just eat one very big apple for lunch every day.

655
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,820
And then they will come by still and be like,

656
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,260
oh, big, big apple, huh?

657
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,620
That's New York, bye, nice, bye.

658
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,820
And then it's like four seconds.

659
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,260
And then they're back out of your life.

660
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,420
Can I offer a slightly more aggressive option?

661
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,860
Sure.

662
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,540
A big clock on your desk, timer that you set to however long

663
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,740
your lunchtime is,

664
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,820
and when your boss comes over to start talking to you,

665
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,220
you stop it, turn and talk to them,

666
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,380
engage with them in their talk,

667
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,460
and then turn back and start it again.

668
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,900
Me talking to you about my precious onions is work.

669
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,940
That's work time.

670
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,820
That's work time.

671
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,020
Are you done?

672
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,660
Because I'm on onion time now.

673
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm on, I will get back to onion time,

674
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,860
but this is work time if we're talking.

675
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,900
You're my boss, you're not my friend, Charles.

676
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,580
And make the clock say that.

677
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,540
You're my boss, not my friend, Charles.

678
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
I will talk to you about my onions,

679
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,580
but it's time theft, and you're the thief.

680
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,900
Goodbye, Charles, and click.

681
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,180
I think that if your boss is talking to you,

682
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,500
you legally should not,

683
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,220
it cannot be counted as your lunch break.

684
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,180
Because like, what else are you breaking from

685
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,620
other than the people you work with?

686
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,660
Right, even if your boss was, in real life,

687
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,220
your best friend, not now.

688
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,020
Not now, it's onion time.

689
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,940
I think he says, you get onions on that?

690
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,420
Nice.

691
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,780
And you say, no, I didn't.

692
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,460
Even though there's onions clearly hanging out

693
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,940
the side of it, because you got so many onions.

694
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,180
You got so many fucking onions on your sandwich,

695
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,020
it can't even contain all the onions.

696
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Maybe you just get two pieces of bread

697
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,860
and like 80 onions in it, and they're like,

698
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,660
oh, onions, huh?

699
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,620
Like whole onions.

700
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,260
Whole onions.

701
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,020
They say, oh, a bunch of whole onions, huh?

702
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,660
Just like Shrek.

703
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,260
And you say, no, I didn't.

704
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,700
Get the fuck out of here, Charles.

705
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,180
Now, we obviously do not support people asking

706
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,380
about your sandwich while you're trying

707
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,340
to have your lunch break.

708
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,700
That's been made clear.

709
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,180
But is there an amount of onions

710
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,100
where you have to just accept

711
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,900
that people are gonna-

712
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,340
It's out of concern instead of interest.

713
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,700
Oh man, too many onions.

714
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,260
Not nice.

715
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,180
It's like you've given up your right

716
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,300
to not be grilled about your, thank you,

717
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,980
about your onions, because there's just so many

718
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,740
that you're inviting it at that point.

719
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,260
It would almost be like a little,

720
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,140
like you're obviously wanting someone to ask.

721
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,420
It's a cry for help.

722
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,020
You're wanting someone to ask you about

723
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,260
how many onions you want to slice to onions.

724
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,500
Right.

725
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,300
Thank you.

726
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,020
I think it's you and your cubicle mate,

727
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,620
Parson, Parson Brown, and the two of you

728
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,460
are eating your big onion sandwiches

729
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,060
and laughing and talking about how great

730
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
the onions are today.

731
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,900
So sweet, so crisp, so bitter, so many.

732
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,620
And then your boss comes by and is like,

733
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,740
hey, you guys having an onion?

734
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,380
And you both turn to Charles at the same time.

735
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,660
You're like, Charles, not now.

736
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,740
We're talking about our onions.

737
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,060
I'll talk to you later when I'm done talking

738
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,820
to my friend, Parson, about the onions.

739
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,660
But now you're interrupting and being rude.

740
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,740
And then you do that every day

741
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,380
and you're gonna get very sick

742
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,060
from all the onions.

743
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Yeah, but it'll be worth it.

744
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,860
It's a good episode.

745
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,460
This is the spec script of the office

746
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,260
we're writing right now.

747
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,060
Oh, Jim's at it again.

748
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Jim's at it again.

749
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,380
Dwight's like, what's with the onions?

750
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,900
He's like, I don't know what you're talking about, Dwight.

751
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,260
And Dwight just starts crying.

752
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,460
He says, these aren't onions.

753
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,980
And then he gets onion poisoning.

754
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,620
And dies.

755
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,180
But then he comes back as a ghost

756
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,540
and haunts Dwight.

757
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,980
Happy Halloween.

758
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,140
And he didn't die because the staff

759
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,900
at Chicago Med was there.

760
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,580
That's right, crossover episode.

761
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,020
And he just keeps looking into his snow globe.

762
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,420
Yeah, and that one's in it too.

763
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,020
Crisis on an onion.

764
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,100
Then old Dick Van Dyke shows up at the office

765
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,060
and he's like, my diagnosis is murder.

766
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,660
You know, it's funny.

767
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,780
If he did show up once, it's like,

768
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,540
my diagnosis is murder.

769
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,060
They would say, well, thank you for that.

770
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,340
That's very vindicating.

771
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,220
Could you maybe solve a crime now?

772
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,540
And then you die.

773
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,340
Murder.

774
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,060
Yeah, there's a knife and the whole bit.

775
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,980
We definitely know the diagnosis

776
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,900
of this case is murder.

777
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,580
Could you do something to advance

778
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,220
the resolution of the murder?

779
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,700
And then Viola Davis walks on screen

780
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
where there's already about 14 characters

781
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,220
at this point and just says,

782
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,860
how to get away with onions.

783
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,540
And then she leaves with all the onions

784
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,740
because nobody noticed.

785
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,380
And who's that?

786
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,980
It's J.D. and Turk.

787
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,580
And they are up to their old tricks

788
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,140
and scrubbing onions.

789
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm having a lot of fun with you boys today.

790
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,580
OK, I guess it's time to go to the money zone.

791
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,020
Let's go.

792
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,820
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron.

793
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,140
Boy, if you like onions, there's one

794
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,340
and basically all of them.

795
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,420
And that's good because onions are good

796
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,340
and these recipes are good.

797
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,980
All all the stuff comes to you

798
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,700
in pre-portioned ingredients that are fresh

799
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,140
and step by step recipes

800
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,100
that come right to your door.

801
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,460
They tell you what to do with the onions,

802
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,100
how to touch them, and they can all be cooked

803
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,140
in under 45 minutes.

804
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,460
The menu features 12 new recipes each week

805
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,900
based on what's in season.

806
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,180
Onions are always in season

807
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,340
and is designed by Blue Apron's

808
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,540
in-house culinary team

809
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,380
with incredible ingredients

810
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,420
and chef-designed recipes

811
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,780
like strip steaks with potatoes

812
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,220
and spicy maple collard greens.

813
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,260
Blue Apron lets you see

814
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,780
what the power of food can do.

815
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,780
Harness it.

816
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,060
Harness this power.

817
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,260
Blue Apron is treating my brother,

00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,140

Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

826
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,260
I would like to tell you

827
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,940
about Bowl and Branch.

828
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,420
I love sheets and I'm not afraid.

829
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,060
Who knows it?

830
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,820
Did you know that every day

831
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,060
you spend 14 hours in sheets?

832
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,580
That sounds about right for me, actually.

833
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,620
That's not true for Justin, yeah.

834
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,340
So anyway, sheets are great.

835
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,540
Well, if you're out of the time

836
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,700
I spend at Sheets the gas station

837
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,300
and Sheets the sheets,

838
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
it's probably pretty close.

839
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,100
Justin spends about two hours sleeping

840
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,540
and then 12 hours crying

841
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,660
in a Sheets bathroom.

842
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,780
Bow and Branch sheets are crafted

843
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,540
with 100% organic cotton.

844
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,140
They look great and they feel amazing.

845
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,300
I can very much vouch for that.

846
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,620

848
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,340
you know, the retail markups

849
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,420
because you pay a lot of like

850
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,540
brick and mortar store like operation costs

851
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,580
when you buy the store.

852
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,620

00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
every other Tuesday

883
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,300
as they discuss entertainment and life

884
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,740
while relating it all back

885
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,100
to how we should raise our kids.

886
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
And it says, join in the conversation

887
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,340
by searching Hi, Hungry podcast

888
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,100
on all social media platforms

889
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
and listen on your favorite podcast app.

890
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,220
These two daddies sound like

891
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,580
they have it all figured out.

892
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,460
And I wanna be there with them.

893
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
I would just, any answers they have

894
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,020
if they have some answers for me.

895
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,100
I'm feeling a little lost right now.

896
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,300
I have a personal message here.

897
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,620
This one's-

898
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,420
How do it hate Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad?

899
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,300
How do it sleep?

900
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,700
Don't know, don't know.

901
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,900
I got a message here for Jack

902
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,260
and it's from Dad.

903
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,500
Daddy says to Jack,

904
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,340
Jack, this is your father reminding you

905
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,780
not to sweat the small things.

906
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,820
You're perfect as you are

907
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,820
and have made your mother and I very proud.

908
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,260
I love you more than a bushel,

909
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,020
a peck, a barrel and a heap.

910
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,980
I love you enough to kiss you square on the lips.

911
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,460
This is the best dad then, huh?

912
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,260
This is so sweet.

913
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,020
Yeah, way better than Justin.

914
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,220
Best dad sounds like best dad

915
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,260
and maybe best Jack

916
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,820
and Jack don't sweat the small stuff.

917
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,620
Yeah, don't get small sweaty things, you know?

918
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,220
Listen to your dad.

919
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,460
Don't let your small things get sweaty

920
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
and don't even sweat the big stuff.

921
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,860
Now, the medium stuff,

922
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,540
you gotta keep a fucking eye.

923
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,940
Keep your head on a swivel for the medium stuff, Jack,

924
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,620
because that's where they get you.

925
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,540
That's where they get you.

926
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,740
Mostly the middle.

927
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,620
One more.

928
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,660
This is for Kelly and it's from Kelly.

929
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,860
Whoa, from Kelly to Justin.

930
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,020
Kelly, happy birthday, Kelly.

931
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,900
Although, Kelly,

932
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,460
you know how the brothers McElroy are, Kelly,

933
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,900
and this message is probably being read in June, Kelly.

934
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,380
In that case, happy mom-iversary, Kelly,

935
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,220
and happy third birthday, McDermott.

936
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,020
And if it's any other time of the year, Kelly,

937
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,140
well, great job.

938
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,500
Now, to be fair, we didn't get that in June,

939
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,380
but it does say as close to January 4th as possible.

940
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,580
All right.

941
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,180
Yeah, we did about as bad a job.

942
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,900
Happy Olympic closing ceremonies, Kelly.

943
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,820
You've done it.

944
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,340
You did great up there.

945
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,780
Could have done better.

946
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,740
Could have been worse.

947
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,020
Could have been worse.

948
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,140
You did great up there.

949
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,940
You extinguished the Olympic torch.

950
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
We are all so proud.

951
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,460
You extinguished the Olympic torch with your mind.

952
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,380
Which was cool, but no one asked you to do that.

953
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,660
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

954
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,140
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor.

955
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,100
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

956
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,540
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

957
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,340
You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real people,

958
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,980
who have submitted disputes to my internet court

959
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,660
at the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

960
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,860
I hear their cases.

961
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,060
I ask them questions.

962
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,020
They're good ones.

963
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
And then I tell them who's right and who's wrong.

964
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,580
Thanks to Judge John Hodgman's ruling,

965
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,260
my dad has been forced to retire,

966
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,740
one of the worst dad jokes of all time.

967
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,780
Instead of cutting his own hair with a flowbee,

968
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,660
my husband has his hair cut professionally.

969
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,580
I have to join a community theater group.

970
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,220
And my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals

971
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,580
It's the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

972
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,380
Find it every Wednesday at MaximumFun.org

973
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,140
or wherever you download podcasts.

974
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,900
Thanks, Judge John Hodgman.

975
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,660
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Nathan Smith.

976
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,300
Thank you, Nathan.

977
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,740
It's Yahoo Answers user.

978
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,700
Sorry, something's gone wrong, but it was sent in by Jason.

979
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,020
Jason Jith, who asks,

980
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,380
how do I play a video game?

981
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,300
I never played a video game in my life before.

982
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,740
What video game should I get?

983
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,980
There was like thousands of video games at the stores

984
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,500
with lots of colorful pictures.

985
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,340
Also, I think the store person said,

986
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,380
I need to have a console.

987
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,860
What is that?

988
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,020
PS3, PS4, Xbox, Nintendo?

989
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,980
What is that?

990
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,140
No, that's the upsell.

991
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,340
You don't need a console.

992
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,060
You do not need it.

993
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,540
Yeah.

994
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,420
You do not need it.

995
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,540
That's how they get you.

996
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,980
Do you own a Discman?

997
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,480
Yeah.

998
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,740
I got good news, vis-a-vis Kirby.

999
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,300
He's here.

1000
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,940
You're gonna need,

1001
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,860
you are gonna need the adapter though.

1002
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,940
Yes, the Kirby adapter.

1003
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,580
It goes on your mouth and it lets you suck stuff in

1004
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,620
to turn into a fire or a laser.

1005
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,260
There's so many games though.

1006
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,620
And where do you even start?

1007
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,260
Never played a game and you want to start being gaming.

1008
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,460
I mean, what kind of,

1009
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,740
let's start from the basics.

1010
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,140
Getting your head in the right place.

1011
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,620
So for me, I think it's important to take a beat

1012
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,220
and plug in your game into whatever disc player you got.

1013
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,140
And then you need to take a second

1014
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,540
and just remember, none of it's real.

1015
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:36,980
It's not.

1016
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,020
That is so important.

1017
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,660
Because you do, you play Kirby and you think like,

1018
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,900
am I gonna get stomped by the monsters?

1019
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,940
Is the big tree gonna throw apples at me until I die?

1020
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,780
That almost never happens.

1021
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,580
It almost never happens.

1022
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,980
And you're fighting the big tree and it's yelling at you

1023
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,580
and throwing the big apples at you.

1024
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,940
And you could, if you're not a gamer,

1025
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,860
you might think I'm going to die when the pink man dies

1026
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,940
because of all the apples that got thrown right at me

1027
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,900
that hit me.

1028
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,300
And now I'm too scared to continue gaming.

1029
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
And it's really important for me to tell you

1030
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,060
that most of the games, if you die in them,

1031
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
you won't die in real life.

1032
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Most of them.

1033
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,340
And I will say this is something that they won't tell you.

1034
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,740
But you could, if you used to read Nintendo Power,

1035
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,060
this is like on the last page of every Nintendo Power,

1036
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,140
a list of games that you actually,

1037
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,460
the only way to win is to turn off the game

1038
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,660
and never play it again.

1039
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,340
Like you'd be in one of those fights where like,

1040
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,820
there's no way I can beat this boss.

1041
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,340
Well, the trick is you turn it off and that kills the boss.

1042
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,020
Yeah, it only exists while you're playing.

1043
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,900
Sometimes you gotta move your controller

1044
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,540
over to the second port.

1045
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,500
That's something that will work in some games.

1046
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,860
Yeah, I do that with every game now,

1047
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,260
just to make sure that I'm not being tricked in some way.

1048
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,860
Another thing to keep in mind

1049
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,780
is if you have a bad time with the game

1050
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,540
and say you're playing Kirby's Dream Land,

1051
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,220
even though it's called Kirby's Dream Land,

1052
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,180
Kirby didn't make it.

1053
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,260
Kirby didn't make the game.

1054
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,540
He's the star of the game.

1055
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,820
And so they called it Kirby's Dream Land.

1056
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,580
And I know that's confusing because like,

1057
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,540
when you go to the movies and you go see like,

1058
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,700
I wanna see George Lucas' Star Wars,

1059
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,260
you know right there what it says on the tin who made it.

1060
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,380
That's not how it works in games sometimes.

1061
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,580
Sometimes it'll be called like Super Mario's Odyssey.

1062
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,300
But it's not, he didn't, Jesus Christ,

1063
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,660
how are you not getting this?

1064
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,100
He didn't make it.

1065
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,380
He didn't make it.

1066
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,260
Someone made it.

1067
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,860
Like one or two people made it.

1068
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,300
When you get angry at the game

1069
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,060
because you died from too many apples,

1070
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
stop writing angry letters to Kirby.

1071
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,460
He didn't, it's not him.

1072
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,420
He didn't do it.

1073
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,300
He didn't make it.

1074
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,580
Jack Kirby made it.

1075
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,940
Jack Kirby made it by himself.

1076
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,580
Another joke about video games is trade-ins.

1077
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,660
If you, the problem with getting into video games

1078
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,140
is if you don't already have video games to trade in

1079
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,420
towards a brand new video game,

1080
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,020
you really, there's no way to get into the systems.

1081
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,300
You can't get into the system.

1082
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,740
So you're kind of locked out.

1083
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,140
You could inherit games and that's pretty much it.

1084
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,900
Can I ask you boys, I'm not a professional gamer.

1085
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,300
I have a question for you two boys.

1086
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,900
I think you're professional gamers.

1087
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
I haven't checked in in a while.

1088
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,340
Is there, did they ever make a matching power glove

1089
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,300
so you could have two?

1090
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,820
And so you can really fondle the pong.

1091
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,220
Yeah, cause if I just have the power glove on one hand,

1092
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,820
doesn't my other hand get cold?

1093
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,540
Yeah, but that's the game of your life.

1094
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,780
Just cold hand?

1095
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,020
Something also is you're gonna start getting frustrated

1096
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,700
that you can't figure out how to kiss in every video game.

1097
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,780
Cause a lot of games are pretty open

1098
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,540
with what the kissing button is, the Sims, other ones.

1099
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,820
But a lot of the time you'll be like,

1100
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,220
I don't think there's a way to, just keep trying.

1101
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,700
You're gonna, you're gonna figure it out.

1102
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,700
Mario is missing is you have to press X and Y

1103
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,620
at the same time and then Luigi.

1104
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,820
Wait, shit, really?

1105
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,860
Is Mario missing?

1106
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,700
Griffin, you can't drop that on me.

1107
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:01,940
Yeah.

1108
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,060
What if I need to talk to him?

1109
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,340
Well, that was the last Mario game.

1110
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,220
Cause he was not, well, he was found, his body was.

1111
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,500
But while you're playing that one,

1112
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,020
you're gonna want to kiss and you're not gonna figure out

1113
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,380
how to just hit X and Y together.

1114
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,460
If you get online, online is a great resource

1115
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,980
for knowledge for so many things.

1116
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,820
And a lot of times people, online, you know,

1117
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,820
web content users will tell you

1118
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,540
what buttons to press to do, to kiss.

1119
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,540
Another thing that if you're just getting into gaming now

1120
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,020
that I think, no one talks about,

1121
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,460
but I'll tell you right now,

1122
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,420
you'll find yourself playing Sonic T Hedgehog

1123
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,780
and you'll be like, I'm feeling an erotic interest in this,

1124
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,700
but the game images aren't giving me what I need.

1125
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,100
Is there somewhere where I might find these images?

1126
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,380
And the answer is no.

1127
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,180
No, unfortunately that just, no one's gotten into that yet.

1128
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,260
You're the only one that feels that way.

1129
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,980
And I'm sorry I have to break that to you.

1130
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,900
Yeah, it's rough.

1131
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,180
A lot of people go looking for horny Sonic T Hedgehog images

1132
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,860
after they're done playing Sonic Hedgehog,

1133
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,340
but there's not, I'm so sorry.

1134
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,100
There isn't any.

1135
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,780
There isn't any and we haven't figured out

1136
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,660
how to make them yet.

1137
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,100
So stop asking.

1138
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,900
So stop asking.

1139
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,740
Elon Musk was working on it for a while

1140
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,260
and then he got distracted by space.

1141
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,380
But hopefully he'll get back into it

1142
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,340
because he was, Elon Musk is really into

1143
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,660
erotic Sonic T Hedgehog imagery.

1144
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,420
Oh, and Travis, can you give me that one clean

1145
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,340
so that when we're taking to court

1146
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,820
they have like exactly the sound bite that they need.

1147
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,260
All right, Justin, just be quiet for a sec.

1148
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,340
Here, I'm gonna put in a click right here

1149
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,140
just so we have it clean.

1150
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,780
Go ahead and say that thing you just said again, Travis, legally.

1151
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,140
Elon Musk is very into erotic Sonic T Hedgehog imagery.

1152
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,220
Okay, I said okay a little tight there,

1153
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,260
but I think we can cut it out.

1154
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,620
Yeah, we can clean that up.

1155
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,340
We'll cut it down.

1156
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,700
I wanna read another question.

1157
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,980
Well, I just also wanted to say,

1158
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,580
get the Xbox that plays all the games.

1159
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:56,980
Go ahead.

1160
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,820
I teach seventh grade English language arts

1161
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,940
at a local middle school.

1162
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,540
There has been a dead roach on the inside

1163
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,060
of one of the lights for an entire year.

1164
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,460
Nasty.

1165
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,300
I haven't moved it because one,

1166
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,460
I wouldn't know how to put the light cover back on

1167
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,780
and two, I never thought anyone would notice.

1168
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,860
Nobody knows how to put the light cover back on.

1169
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,780
You have to take it off and that's how you learn.

1170
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,300
None of us know.

1171
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,220
Okay, I do like that this question,

1172
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,100
that also struck me that the question I was concerned wasn't,

1173
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,540
I don't know how to take the cover off.

1174
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,700
Obvious, got it.

1175
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,860
But then what do I do?

1176
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,060
That is a much worse scenario.

1177
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,700
In their defense, it is much worse to call facilities

1178
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,580
and be like, we've got a light fixture on the ground over here.

1179
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,940
Vandals.

1180
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,620
Vandals have unscrewed.

1181
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,260
Anyway, that all changed when my fifth period class

1182
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,940
decided to personify the roach

1183
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,180
as our deceased class pet named Tommy.

1184
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,300
I played along with it because it seemed like silly harmless fun.

1185
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,860
However, my students now have a funeral plan

1186
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,780
for Tommy the roach on Friday of this week.

1187
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,340
One student wrote a eulogy and several of them requested

1188
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,020
that I wear black out of respect.

1189
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm concerned about wasting class time,

1190
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,100
but I don't want to stifle my students creativity.

1191
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,740
Please help.

1192
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,980
This is Creative Cockroach Conundrum in Texas.

1193
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,220
Here, if you wanted to like live in the bit,

1194
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,300
but also try to get things back on track

1195
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,700
so you learn about, I don't know,

1196
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,140
which countries are named what.

1197
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,460
Oh, it's language arts.

1198
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,940
Okay, well that's, yeah, they have English language names.

1199
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,440
Sure.

1200
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,500
You could say that like,

1201
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
since they didn't know the roach when it was alive,

1202
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,620
they don't really know what sort of like faith background

1203
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,700
the roach had and they don't know,

1204
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,300
you don't know like what kind of service

1205
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,740
the roach would have wanted.

1206
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,700
Like that could be how he wanted to sort of like

1207
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,420
spend his after days is there in the light fixture

1208
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,020
without a bunch of Judeo-Christian nonsense,

1209
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,740
sort of like helping shepherd him across the river Styx.

1210
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,900
Now you could, if you did want to make it educational,

1211
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,100
you're going to need a conveyor belt.

1212
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,420
You're going to need a small toilet

1213
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,940
and you're going to have the conveyor belt

1214
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,140
going into the toilet

1215
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,380
and you're going to put Tommy on one end of it,

1216
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,820
Tommy's desiccated corpse and desiccated.

1217
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,780
It's been both things.

1218
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,060
And you put it on there and you let the conveyor belt go

1219
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,420
and you say like, oh, the conveyor belt's going,

1220
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,900
better tell me what a preposition is.

1221
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,100
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1222
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,340
And get them to answer some high pressure.

1223
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,500
Because one thing the roach doesn't want for its last rites

1224
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,700
is to go in a toilet like some sort of common fish.

1225
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,180
Here's the thing, when you're worried about it being educational,

1226
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,500
I think what you really need to do is look around the room,

1227
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,340
look every child in the eyes and decide in your own mind,

1228
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,700
are any of these kids going to be funeral directors?

1229
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:49,780
Because if so, what you're doing is incredibly educational.

1230
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,660
Do you have one particularly spooky student?

1231
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,020
You know the type I'm talking about

1232
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,500
and I'm not telling you to put your kids in a box.

1233
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,380
I'm just saying.

1234
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,020
We're also not saying every funeral director is spooky.

1235
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,420
I'm saying that absolutely.

1236
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,260
You have one student that comes to class

1237
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,420
in a big top hat and a big dirty dark frock.

1238
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,180
Not every funeral director is spooky.

1239
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,580
Some of them just needed some fast cash.

1240
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,980
People get in binds.

1241
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,660
In a hot, high stakes world of directing funerals,

1242
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,620
how do you need a director for a funeral?

1243
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,500
It's not a fucking James Cameron flick.

1244
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,060
It's like, here's the box, go do the weeping and all.

1245
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,060
Not for mine, buddy.

1246
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,540
Mine pyrotechnics, light shows.

1247
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,740
Where do we put the flowers?

1248
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,020
We better hire somebody to tell us where the flowers.

1249
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,580
Hey, my grandpa's up there.

1250
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,180
Can you tell me, am I supposed to do sad?

1251
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,500
If you're in the funeral biz or your family is

1252
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,940
and you're about to start tweeting at us,

1253
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,780
just please only direct those at Griffin

1254
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,860
because I do not need the existential crisis

1255
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,660
when I'm trying to just hang on for dear life.

1256
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,940
So please just direct those funeral related tweets at Ditto.

1257
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,940
No, funeral directors are a good job

1258
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,460
and people who do it are valuable and Tim Allen sucks shit.

1259
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
Let's just do all the disclaimers at the end of the show.

1260
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,460
M. Night Shyamalan is my favorite funeral director

1261
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,460
because you walk out to the casket

1262
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,860
and you look at him and go, wait, I'm in there, twist.

1263
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,300
Yeah, it's me in there and he's me and I'm him.

1264
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,800
Uh-oh.

1265
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,620
Twist.

1266
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,500
There's the twist.

1267
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,700
Man, students will do fucking anything

1268
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,980
to get out of reading a book for even like a minute, huh?

1269
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,480
Uh-huh.

1270
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,740
We can twist this and have fun with it for as long as we want,

1271
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,380
but this is a lot like when we were doing Spanish class

1272
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,660
in high school and we knew our teacher really liked Finding Nemo

1273
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,660
and so we just swore up and down like,

1274
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,060
I feel like just watching Finding Nemo

1275
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,900
with the Spanish subtitles on is the best way for me to absorb this.

1276
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
So just go ahead and put that one on again

1277
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,260
and that right there is good teaching.

1278
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,740
I had a teacher named Mr. Sheets in middle school

1279
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:04,100
and he taught us algebra and Mr. Sheets also loved the Civil War.

1280
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,700
He was like a Civil War reenactor.

1281
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,100
So when we would like want to throw things off the rails,

1282
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,820
we would just ask him a question about the Civil War

1283
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,820
and in the moment, I felt very like smarmy about it.

1284
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,740
Like, oh, we got him.

1285
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,260
But then looking back on it,

1286
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,140
I realized I learned a lot about the Civil War in that class.

1287
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,500
So he kind of got me.

1288
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,900
He kind of still did get me.

1289
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,780
I wonder if more classes would be more effective

1290
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,820
if teachers like use this sort of strategy.

1291
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,100
Like on paper, you're the math teacher,

1292
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,980
but secretly, you know, it's all about geometry.

1293
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,740
So you feel like you're pulling one over on him

1294
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,140
whenever you're hearing about geometry,

1295
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,900
but really that was the plan all along.

1296
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,660
I mean, it's a failure, I think, of the class.

1297
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,540
If I go to lit class and I learn about biology, that's cool.

1298
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,100
But it's not really what I signed up for.

1299
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,700
It's not the credit that I think.

1300
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,140
I'm gonna show up to, you know, lit two in college

1301
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,900
and be like, all right, time to talk about Dickens.

1302
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,020
And he'll be like, I don't know what that is,

1303
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,540
but I can tell you what a...

1304
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,380
Well, the teachers would need a system

1305
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,380
where all the subjects would still be covered.

1306
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,580
The secret subjects would cover all the bases.

1307
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,700
It's just one to the left.

1308
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,660
Yeah, there you go. Thank you. Yes, exactly.

1309
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,220
This might be weird,

1310
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,460
but as long as we're talking about West Virginia teachers,

1311
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,020
we should mention that all the schools in West Virginia

1312
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,340
are closed because all the teachers at public schools

1313
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,620
are on strike because they got fucked

1314
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,780
by the state legislature.

1315
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,020
And you should go support them however you can.

1316
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,180
They're trying to get a 5% pay raise

1317
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,340
instead of the shitty 2% pay raise,

1318
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,060
which doesn't cover rising cost of insurance,

1319
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,900
which used to be covered.

1320
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,660
The tripling cost of insurance.

1321
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,160
Right.

1322
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,900
It's absolutely madness.

1323
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,340
There was a state resource

1324
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,380
to pay for public educators' insurance

1325
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,500
that is no longer funded,

1326
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,340
which is something that they are also fighting for.

1327
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,260
So we're very proud of them.

1328
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,180
Literally every teacher in all 55 counties

1329
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,740
are fighting back to try and get these things.

1330
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,940
And schools have been closed for,

1331
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,100
I think this is the fourth day today of the strike.

1332
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,860
I believe so.

1333
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,460
Technically work stoppage, technically.

1334
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,580
Work stoppage, yes.

1335
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,380
I don't know what the difference is.

1336
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,740
There's a whole thing.

1337
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,380
It's a whole thing.

1338
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,620
Yeah, I figured we should mention that

1339
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,900
because we made jokes here,

1340
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,420
but we had good teachers growing up

1341
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,820
and they deserve to be compensated and taken care of.

1342
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,620
And Reese Witherspoon tweeted about this work stoppage.

1343
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,100
I heard.

1344
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,300
That's what I heard.

1345
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,020
We got Reese on our side.

1346
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,660
Reese Witherspoon teaches in West Virginia?

1347
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,780
No, no, she just tweeted.

1348
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,460
Speaking of the end of the show,

1349
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,460
this is it.

1350
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,500
You've reached it.

1351
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,140
We've done it.

1352
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,220
We've beaten the odds.

1353
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,180
I've beaten the odds.

1354
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,140
I guess Travis too.

1355
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,180
Hey, Trav, do you have like,

1356
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,860
I meant to ask you much earlier.

1357
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,340
Do you have like wobbly legs

1358
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,060
you're adjusting back to land life?

1359
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,420
Not wobbly legs so much

1360
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,380
as I'll just be sitting there

1361
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,380
and suddenly feel like I'm falling over.

1362
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,820
Oh, that's the pits.

1363
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,700
It's great.

1364
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,900
I'm loving it.

1365
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,260
It's kind of exciting, I guess.

1366
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,980
In all seriousness,

1367
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,180
really was an absolute blast.

1368
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,540
I want to say thank you again

1369
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,420
to Joko Cruz for having me and my wife

1370
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,020
and dad and everybody there.

1371
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,860

They are already selling cabins for 2019.

1374
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,220
They might be, Giants is gonna be on it.

1375
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,660
It's leaving from, I believe,

1376
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,660
the East Coast, Florida this year.

1377
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,380
Yeah, they're doing the Caribbean this year.

1378
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,880
What?

1379
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,940
They're doing the Caribbean next year.

1380
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,340
Yeah, it's gonna be super fun.

1381
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:30,980
Go check it out.

1382
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,700
Also, plugging stuff,

1383
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,260
Schmaners is going to be performing

1384
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,540
at Moon Tower Comedy Festival, April 18th.

1385

S-H-M-A-N-N-E-R-S.

1388
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,460
Where's that at, scrubs?

1389
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,660
It's in Austin, Texas.

1390
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,500
Hello there.

1391
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,100
I want to thank John Roderick

1392

00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,300
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1395
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,060
It's a fantastic album

1396
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,900
and you're just gonna love the shit out of it.

1397

1405
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,340
and you can find out where all our podcasts

1406
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,700
and videos and stuff live.

1407
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,060
So that's it.

1408
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,100
Here comes that final.

1409
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,780
It was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

1410
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,420
Thank you, Merritt.

1411
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,020
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1412
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,540
They're anonymous and for good reason

1413
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,220
because their perverse question is,

1414
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,140
where can I find scented candles

1415
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,220
that smell like new Band-Aids?

1416
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,540
My name is Justin McElroy.

1417
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,660
I'm Travis McElroy.

1418
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1419
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,460
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1420
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,100
Kiss your dad.

1421
00:54:44,100 --> 00:55:10,660
Square on the lips.

1422
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,220
Only one podcast is brave enough to call bullshit.

1423
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,260
Who Shot Ya?

1424
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,220
The podcast that dares to say

1425
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,580
that white dude's opinions aren't the only opinions.

1426
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,580
If you have a movie pass,

1427
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,380
like get a ticket to it to support Taraji,

1428
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,180
then go home.

1429
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,700
Ant-Man seems so unnecessary at this point.

1430
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,060
Ant-Man is like a ketchup packet too many.

1431
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,340
Who Shot Ya?

1432
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,860
With Ricky Carmona.

1433
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,620
I wanted to see Wolverine kick ass

1434
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,380
and eat some popcorn and have a good time.

1435
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,980
Alonzo Duralde.

1436
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,100
Is this Andy Richter?

1437
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,420
And April Wolf.

1438
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,060
I love wild things because I get to see Kevin Bacon's dick.

1439
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,060
Who Shot Ya?

1440
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,300
Listen every Friday on Maximum Fun

1441
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:16,100
