1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,960
Hey welcome my brother my brother me and advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,880
Expert I spitting okay. I'm your spittle this brother Travis McElroy

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm your sweet baby brother celebrity body language

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
interpreter and and sort of

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,920
Envoy to the stars and all that sweet drama drama that exists in the nebulous sort of space between them

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,800
Griffin McElroy and boys we got a dozer to break down for you for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, isn't it?

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,080
Strange, it's 90s kids are gonna love this one. Oh my god. They're wild for it

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,360
Remember because the magic loogie episode of Seinfeld

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,800
Recreated the Zap Rooter film as a spitting incident and now that is happening in real life funny show funny life

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,740
It's just like when I had my vasectomy and the doctor dropped a junior mint into my testicles

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Yeah, I felt yeah, yeah, and it felt pretty good

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,280
We yeah, it feels good. Yeah, man, it's

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,560
Yeah, that's why we call this show my brother my waddle are in me

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,120
And so you've heard all the takes that you need to at this point about these two

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,420
Famouses and if one spit it on the other one, but we're here I think to put our own sort of like

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
up twisted

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,640
Skewed spin on it. You're right

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
Because we I think the three of us

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
have

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,680
Operated in these circles. I've never met Christopher or Harold, but I do I met Chris

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,080
I haven't met Christopher or Harold, but I have probably met people who have met Christopher and Harold

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,680
So I feel uniquely qualified. I feel rule on this one

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,480
First of all can't wait to see first of all get it out of the gotta get it

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,760
Gotta get day one. Gotta get my tickets to this flick. I don't know what the yeah

32
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,320
It is seems like so that's gonna be moving easy. It's gonna be

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
Absolute slam dunk

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Everyone seems happy with it first step in the process is find out the name of the flick and then I'm gonna get on night

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,840
It's spit night at the Hawksbury spit night at the Hawksbury gonna get on fun dango and secure my tickets

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Roku and so that's gonna give us a lot of the clues that we need but we don't need them

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
Lesser podcast I guess need to see the film

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,460
And then and then they'll be able to rule on it

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm a star. I'm a body language expert to the stars. Go ahead Travis the one thing I know about the movie

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,880
Yeah, is that if you look at the cast?

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Yeah, just like the first the four people overwhelmed by beauty

43
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,760
You're well

44
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,760
But also it seems like it seems like maybe four different movies are being made at the same time when I tell you that it's Florence

45
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,400
Fewer who's yeah, right great great and then Chris pine. Oh, I could see them being bad by the time you're listening to this

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Yeah, it's Thursday when we're recording Thursday

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,920
Oh, there's a lot of ball game between now and release day. Okay, but here's what I'm saying

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I could see Florence peer and

49
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
and where

50
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,880
And Chris pine being in the same movie. Okay, then we add in Harold Styles. Oh

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,280
All right. Okay, that's entering and then Nick Kroll is there and I'm like, what is it? What is this movie about?

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,640
What is this thing happening funny funny funny folks in it? Okay, so let's get into it. We don't see the loot the

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
That spit no, it's that we don't see the spit land

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,200
But if we did sort of try to chart the trajectory of it looks like it hit Chris pine on his wiener area

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Yeah

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,940
Listen and then Chris pine looks down at his wiener area and he goes wow. He's like wow

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Wow, I'm gonna put the tiger on the table and yell at it right away Tuesday, please cuz Chris pines

58
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,440
Rep came out was like this is ridiculous

59
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Frankly, and I this is an overused phrase but protests too much. He's like what it's ridiculous that you would even think this

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Why would you think that these two men would have any kind of beef? Why would there speak? That's ridiculous

61
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
And it's just like just say no

62
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Why did you use so many words and then Harold came out and he was like, yeah

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,600
I flew to Venice to spit on Chris pine, but I gave it a tone of voice

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,480
That I may be projecting my own sort of insecurities onto it because he may have very well said

65
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,840
Yeah, I I flew to Venice to spit on my like if I knew that I would have that opportunity

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,200
To spit on Star Trek's Chris pine. I would fly to Venice for that on the gray man's Chris pine. Hell yeah

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I'd spit on him

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm saying if it was consensual because everyone saw that was like, whoa, there must be beef

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,440
But we don't know the relationship between these two people and that brings me to my main point

70
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Harold stylish has been famous for since he was a baby and

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,040
He was the Gerber baby. He was Gerber's baby. He was the Coppertone baby with the buzz

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Out he was all the babies in that one insurance commercial that like talked about insurance. You guys remember that?

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,200
Kids bop he was success good. He was all these famous children and then he was in one direction

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
with Zane

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,840
Which multiple directions by the way, so like that time to rename that man

76
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,920
And that's one of Travis's funny jokes that he's Travis has a bunch of them about one direction

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,120
But anyway, all of this is to say we're building to something. We're building to my point which is

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Until this point in his life

79
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,240
Harold stylish has been told that it's good

80
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,340
To for him to spit on people that people like it when he spits on them. Yeah, because of his like

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,600
Tremendous fame like there's so many if you know who he is

82
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,800
He's never been chastised. Yeah, one of his actions

83
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm actually really excited that it seems like he found a boundary because now everyone's just like we love it Harry

84
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Harold stylish, whatever you do

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
That look that's great that song that's great

86
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Everything you do is great this pine came up to him after as he's like, there'll be a consequence for that

87
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,140
And he was like, oh, what do you mean?

88
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Well, I don't know

89
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,800
When Chris pine looks down at his at his dirty lap

90
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,160
He is not it's not disbelief. It's

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
thoughtful

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,200
Consideration of like is this good? This man is good. Is this good? He's very famous and very handsome

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,640
Is this a good thing you did to me? I don't know. He spat upon my chinos. Do I?

94
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Do I hate this? Do I love it? Do I love this? I think what you're seeing in

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Chris pines face. Yeah

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,960
There's a if you follow the logic you can watch it

97
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,120
You can see his face. Here's what he's thinking. Uh-huh. Well

98
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,540
Huh?

99
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:15,600
Someone has Harry Styles just spit on my dick. Yeah, I know I'm already Captain Kirk. Yeah, and that was good

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,560
I liked I don't know. I don't know how many more of those if any I'm gonna do

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Yeah, should I know Harry Styles off his balcony? I haven't done

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,560
Let just let me finish cuz I gotta walk you through Chris pines mental state

103
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
this I

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,160
Don't love this for obvious reasons. I'm right now. I'm wet now and stick

105
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm wet now, and I don't like it. Okay, and everyone knows

106
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,740
There is a certain chain of events here

107
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,400
wherein when you look up Chris pine in the future

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
encyclopedia

109
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,340
It is actor on whom's dick Harry Styles spit

110
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah, I have not established so many other pillars of my identity that it wouldn't be

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Fairly high up. Yeah, if this continues to be the thing that everybody talks about forever, right?

112
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,820
It's like I don't want this to be a thing where like people see me in there like lol

113
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,360
Anchorman 3 let's get Chris fine in there. So somebody can spit

114
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,760
That is a good point Justin. I don't want Chris pine doesn't want his dick referenced in comedy for a while

115
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,640
He wants it referenced in drama, right? He's like, I'm fine if people make Thomas about my dick

116
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,120
That's fine, right and then cuz it's just sort of like Chris Rock right now every script he gets. Yeah, like three pages

117
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,120
It's like and then someone hits you full force in the face. Yeah, because America has been talking about that

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,400
And I am surprised the reference that the reps for those two gentlemen did not pull a similar gambit of like do you really think?

119
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,000
William Willard Smith would hit Chris Rock at the Oscars. Come on

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know what you thought you saw. The Internet's just chewing its cud. Yeah, the Internet feeds itself

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
It's an Ouroboros. You see they're just

122
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Like us they are just like us. They spit on each other's dicks just like us was

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,280
Kidding around he was attempting to do face paint and is extremely bad at it

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:21,040
There was a fly on Chris Rock's cheek and he was trying to help him out. There was a small fire on Chris Pine's balls. I

125
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,120
Again and this British hero who served his country in Dunkirk

126
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,760
He saved him at least now if you ask Will Smith his favorite singer

127
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,040
You know that his answer is always gonna be all Harry Styles. Oh sure. He's basically my favorite dude

128
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,400
Did you see what he spit on Chris Pines dick?

129
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,440
I kind of just kind of left the left the public consciousness of their well

130
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Problems are our problems

131
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,520
They're just like us and I love that about them and hey, you know

132
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Maybe maybe Chris Pine was hungry and Harry Styles could sense that and he's trying to mama bird into his mouth and he just missed

133
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,680
There's so many different great possibilities for what could have happened, right?

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,700
Yeah, but none of them none of them did that we know of we will know history will never know

135
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,020
I will say this please say if Harry Styles did spit on Chris Pine

136
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,700
He should be embarrassed of the bad loogie. He did it wasn't

137
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,020
See it wasn't impressive if you're gonna, you know, if you're gonna go to town, you better go to Lincoln

138
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,020
Hawkwood really get one out that room for air

139
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,020
Maybe that was it. Maybe there was no loogie

140
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:37,100
But maybe Harold stylish is perfected like making a loogie sound effect and he like made it and then Chris Pine was like

141
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,540
I definitely have just gotten spit up. Oh, that's it. He was like what Wow, there's no spit

142
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,940
But I was convinced the way you made the sound with your mouth. That's I thought I'd been spit upon

143
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,540
Is this another one of your magic goofs? Yeah that you're known for. It's like when you step to someone you're like, oh

144
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,960
You flinched it was like that. It was a fake. It was a fake spit and the you know, there's a there's a

145
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,980
Cultural barrier there is and a quiet beauty. There's a quiet beauty. I control barrier

My son is a year and a half old. Okay, guys. We've been lucky to have a lot of gifts sent to him from generous family

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
And friends, however, there's one problem people keep sending in personalized piggy banks

155
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,640
We're now at four piggy banks or we're running out of places to keep these things

156
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,840
The second piggy bank was funny after the third piggy bank. I thought surely we won't get any more, but they still keep coming

157
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,480
We can't sell them because they have our son's full name and birth date on them. Yeah brothers, please

158
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,080
What do we do about all these banks? That's for piggy bank plethora. Let me say this. Oh

159
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,120
Piggy banks these days are bullshit

160
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,860
Okay, because they put it a little hole on the bottom of it

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,800
And you can get the money the whole thing with piggy banks is you put all your you know, leftover coins from the ice cream

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,880
Stand and yeah, I don't like an arcade token or something. You'll find that later

163
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,280
Yeah, you'll get that out later. But and then

164
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,800
When the need for money is so great. You must smash this beloved

165
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,040
Object so that you can get the stuff out of it. So maybe this is a return

166
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,040
To a better time where you you have to smash these banks

167
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Because times are tough out there

168
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,240
We should smash more banks frankly than yes piggy banks, but this is good practice

169
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah, it's good practice for smashing banks. Here's uh, I was struck by something Justin hearing you read it

170
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
So well out loud by the way

171
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,080
It was good delivery you did great but the second bank was funny

172
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,080
Made me think is this a possibility? Like have you talked about is this a bit?

173
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,560
Your family is doing with you included like did they like I'm not saying they got behind your back and talked about it

174
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,880
I'm saying that like was there accidentally they got two banks, right and you talked about it with your family and we're like

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
This is funny, huh?

176
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,640
They thought oh because I got two and then there were some members of your family perhaps that were like we'll keep the bit

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,720
Rolling. Oh, we'll do like a third and a fourth and you know

178
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,600
We'll give them another one for their second birthday and they're gonna be like a piggy bank is the thing to get this kid

179
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,360
Yeah, because that we've talked about it before once your family is like, oh, they love you know unicorns

180
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,600
Let's get him a unicorn every time. Yeah, right

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You need to understand the rules of engagement

182
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,180
Which happened the movie and also

183
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,480
The real stuff because we have we have dabbled in this

184
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,360
we're like one of you guys will get one of my beautiful bundles of joy like some

185
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,680
extra sloppy GAC and then

186
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,680
One of you I would never do just don't give my son's an extra sloppy guy and then you know in return it's like

187
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,160
Oh, okay. Well, here's a very loud party robot for your children

188
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
And it doesn't you can't turn it off

189
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:49,440
So once once you have to step it up at least answering kind of maybe escalate it. I'm thinking get them

190
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,400
Someone who has given you a piggy bank for your child get them a piggy bank with their adult name on it

191
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Oh my god, and a date in the future, but do not explain

192
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,640
What that means what that date is like a threat though Griffin?

193
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,640
Yeah, maybe a little bit, huh? Or maybe it's like you'll need this money on you know, July 28th

194
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
2029 or maybe

195
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,680
Something else maybe something else happens. I don't know. I do not know. I love having piggy banks around our house

196
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Yeah, okay. I always whenever I find loose change in there. I just leave them and

197
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,120
And put them in the girls piggy banks now a place to put change

198
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,800
It's fantastic and it's also great because sometimes you go to the car wash, you know, like, oh I need some quarters

199
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,040
time to

200
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,840
Get on it. We got a big old coke bottle bank for for BB

201
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,580
I got it. I got a subscription in magic tunnel. So

202
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,140
That's not a problem for me anymore. I roll right through you have a car wash

203
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,800
Subscription subscription and it's magic. Hey, hey, mr. Green-eyed monster. Maybe calm down a little bit

204
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,400
I do okay, and my wife's a physician

205
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,720
So I who doesn't make money from that but like my I do okay, and so I got a subscription to the car wash

206
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Okay, yeah, I went with the mid-tier

207
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Oh, okay

208
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Why do you need to subscribe?

209
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,200
Why do you need to subscribe? Why can't you just go and get your car washed when it's dirty?

210
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,320
I don't know why you need to subscribe to it probably a better deal

211
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
I have to assume you're gonna you're gonna you're basically yeah

212
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,440
I see the magic tunnel as much as I do you're basically losing money if you don't have a subscription

213
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,100
Now Justin when you say the phrase when you go through the magic tunnel as much as I do

214
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:44,380
Do you know like how many and I I'm like my mind is boggled by how many different things that could be a euphemism for

215
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,700
Yeah, yeah in this case. It's a

216
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,220
Clean car a clean car. Why are you letting your car get so dirty? So I don't kids just love it

217
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,140
They're just wild about all the car wash experience the car wash

218
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh, I thought you said kids love your car and they keep

219
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,100
Running out to it and getting their disgusting fingers off. Kids love this car wash. They're you show up

220
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,540
They're throwing dum-dums in your car some dog biscuits. They're they're hand washing. There's lights. There's sounds. Whoa, whoa, whoa projections

221
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,120
Hold on. Let's not just gloss over this Justin. You don't have a dog. Also what you're describing can't

222
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,140
Possibly exist a little bit of car wash slash dinner theater for children. Yeah, it's fantastic if they Travis

223
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,860
I'm sorry, but like if I don't have a dog now

224
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,180
but

225
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
If I have a subscription

226
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,620
To the car wash and every time I go through I could be getting a dog biscuit and I don't those costs add up

227
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,820
This is why you're broke all the time because you don't think about dollars and cents, you know

228
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,500
I mean, I got a huge garbage bag full of dog biscuits in my house

229
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,540
What are you worried about coyotes because I throw that out there that's gonna keep them busy all day long

230
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,780
Well, it'll also turn your house into a fucking coyote. Just hang the zone

231
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,020
It's gonna get ugly in there. I put weed in the dog biscuits. Oh, not an okay thing to say but go ahead

232
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,820
Odie's. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. No, they're bad. They're gross. Oh, yeah, they kill the deer around the house

233
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,240
Oh a deer are terrible. They killed my willow tree. We don't need to talk. We don't have to go. Okay

234
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,820
I you know what they all ate all my sweet blackberries. So I am saying

235
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,900
and

236
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,620
For that they deserve death. I agree. I agree

237
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,100
They're fucking farmer John over there trying to stab Peter cottontail with your pitch Peter

238
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,460
Cottontail should have stayed the fuck out of McGregor's garden Griffin

239
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,980
Do you want me to kill the deer or kill the coyote cuz I gotta kill one of them

240
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,300
So you choose okay, it's the ones on your hand

241
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,340
It seems like the magic tunnel is where you go to to slake the thirst of your dark passenger

242
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,620
so that the the wildlife in your neighborhood doesn't have to be killed for eating your berries or

243
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,740
Fucked up on these crazy biscuits. There's a there is a coyote in the region right now. Just the one

244
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,780
Maybe probably a pack right? They tend to do that

245
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,220
Yeah, I mean they don't like show up and give you a brochure with how many are in the region

246
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,360
Hey, man, we were acquired by law. We're moving into the neighborhood just like not I know I don't know

247
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,200
But they so they kill the deer and they're like bad. They suck. They're terrible right these terrible coyotes

248
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,060
And they'll attack children if they're if they're out there and my kids are know about this

249
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,520
So they're they're kind of worried about it. And man, I gotta say I

250
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,800
Don't have to fight with my kids about coming inside or listening to me really at all

251
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,780
They don't listen to me when I say hey come inside. It's time to go get ready for bed, but they'll listen to coyotes

252
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,980
Yeah, you should listen to your dad out there. Listen, your dad's working hard. You should listen to he's a good guy

253
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,180
I love his podcast

254
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,740
No, but they're like that don't respond to that if I say come in they say no if I say come in there's coyotes out

255
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,820
There come in it's no problem

256
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,260
Coyotes is what I'm saying that those are called dogs Justin

257
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
But I can't threaten my kids

258
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Sure, you could I can't say I can't say brush your teeth or I'm gonna get a dog. Oh

259
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,780
Brush your teeth or mr. Brutus is gonna pounce when you least expect it

260
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,220
This is what do you think? I have all these dog biscuits kids

261
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,620
You think I get these if I didn't have a nice can I ask a question? Yeah

262
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Why do you guys keep asking me about my car?

263
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,620
Every week

264
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,180
It's a normal thing. It scans your license plate. So you don't have to stop and

265
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,980
You're so on the grid future tech. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I'm not Travis. I'm not just on the grid

266
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,700
I am the kind of person that has a car wash subscription. I'm on a specific point that I am 100%

267
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,700
Locatable. Yes on the apex of the grid. He's got his own axis

268
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,060
Hey, can we go to the wizard? The Wizards got a good one for us today. I love that. Hey guys

269
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,380
I'm having a great time. This has been so I was so glad man. I love doing this show with you guys

270
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,540
So the wizard sent this one in via his

271
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,820
His familiar who is a raven named Dylan sent this in. Thank you Dylan

272
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,740
It's a wiki how in the title of the wiki how is how to moan how to moan?

273
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:25,360
Oh boy moaning moaning tells your partner that you're turned on or feeling a quick

274
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,500
Wait before you get into it before we start learning could Travis and I are maybe all three

275
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,460
I don't want to do it. Could we all practice our like moan and see if it gets better by the end of the article?

276
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,740
I think that's a good point. Yeah, we never do that. Can I put a codicil on this?

277
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,300
It's a we eat at a big beef sandwich and it tastes good

278
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,500
And this is the moan that comes after it because I do not want to expose our listeners to anything

279
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,220
actually salacious

280
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,940
Involving us. This is a beef sandwich satisfaction sandwich moan and this is appropriate for your ringtone

281
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,380
This is our big sandwich moan our real big sandwich moan. How big's the sandwich? I regret this

282
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,100
Okay, I'll do mine first. Justin you go first as the oldest. Okay. Oh

283
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:22,900
That's good, that was actually pretty that actually felt really I feel like I've heard you make that noise post sandwich before or it's

284
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Usually when I sit down. Yeah

285
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,580
Yeah, let me see cuz I'm gonna do a combination of like I just tasted it and it's good

286
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,620
Yeah, go ahead. Don't put a hat on a hat man. Okay moan like you ate a big sandwich

287
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,060
That's not that sucked actually I hated for whatever reason I liked

288
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,300
An open mouth I can try to weird. Oh, let me try. Oh worse

289
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,020
Oh, what's wrong with me? Here we go. Oh, I'm gonna eat the big sandwich if you figured it out, please

290
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Yeah

291
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,860
Now Griffin was that your real big you did a bit there's no it's impossible to judge your growth

292
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,700
But I like to I these are the barrier I actually Travis if you make that noise one more time

293
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,780
Oh, I'm not joking. I'll hang up the call that how am I supposed to get better if I don't practice listen

294
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,840
We each get one more when you're done with the article fair. You two will finish the show without me. Please don't okay

295
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,380
He will definitely definitely I'm gonna try not to but I get to be one after the fact

296
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,220
I have a bear a moan is sexy involuntary noise

297
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,340
You moan in the heat of the moment because you're overcome by sensation from the big beefy sandwich

298
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,260
Uh-huh. Not everyone moans naturally, but training yourself to moan can be a great way to show someone that you're enjoying yourself

299
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,780
Training yourself to moan can be a great way to show someone you're okay

300
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:52,420
understanding the moan know that moaning is involuntary in theory a moan is a noise of passion that escapes you when you're overcome by

301
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,000
pleasure or sensation I'm actually

302
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,460
my

303
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:03,360
Nerves are so like high-strung right now that I need you all to not even make like

304
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
agreement

305
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
But Griffin, can I ask you a question? Yeah, why do you feel like?

306
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,800
Why do you feel like the anxiety so hot?

307
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Why are you so off put by it?

308
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,240
I thought that this this is one of I'm gonna put something else going on in your life that I don't know about

309
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,120
I've just gotten you feeling so stressed. That's what I'm asking

310
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm putting this bit in a box that I have labeled things

311
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:33,360
I thought would be funny but turned out to be instantly so gross that I didn't want to be associated with it any longer

312
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,920
You're good. Hey, I thought you're getting on me about my car wash subscription. I'll get on you about label maker prices

313
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:48,200
I mean you're burning through this tape with these huge labels listen to other people moan watch watch YouTube videos about how to moan

314
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Yeah, that's where they are

315
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,880
Guess that hey

316
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,520
Hey wiki how at least provide some search terms if that's your claim because most of the time you do that

317
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
No, no, no, no, no

318
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,820
Okay, don't feel pressured to moan everyone responds to intense pleasure in their way

319
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,280
And you don't need to force yourself to moan if it doesn't come naturally to you

320
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:23,080
Yes, some people are naturally very loud in bed, but the moons you hear in movies or pornography are intentionally stylized versions of real out reality

321
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:31,720
So that's an important one don't don't just make the sound too because you think you're supposed to make it it should be an exaltation of

322
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
Joy

323
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,080
Pleasure well now hold on wiki how article how are you gonna teach me how to make the sound?

324
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,040
But assume I just know the right time to do it give me some pointers on timing as well

325
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,220
Oh, you don't want to do it right at the beginning. Yeah, that's a definitely know that you just like zip

326
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,760
Avoid outright faking it of course I do I will say that I do tend to moan when I take my bill off for the

327
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:09,000
Shoes shoes is a good one my tiny socks my rendered waist flesh can finally begin to heal

328
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Moan softly during

329
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,400
Foreplay moan loudly when things get intense now. That's interesting

330
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,200
That's a foot now. We're talking about like we're putting together like a DJ

331
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,600
like playlist like you want to get the party going with

332
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,120
huh, and then get into the like

333
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,440
That kind of how loudly once again

334
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm gonna need some decibels here cuz there is definitely a level you could hit where they would be like whoa

335
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,180
Okay, so let's this is where the rubber hits the road practicing your moan start by sighing start by sighing softly

336
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:55,060
That's that was great guys that was great, and it didn't make me feel uncomfortable breathe this is great breathe in and out audibly

337
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:16,820
Suck so fucking bad. That's in it, but that's good. Now. We have like now. We know what parameters. It's somewhere in there. Sigh? Sigh? Fine. Whatever noise I was making. Bad. We hate it.

338
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,700
As your breathing intensifies as add some voice and tone to your breath

339
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,780
HAHAHAHAHA, no wait, I'm doing Gorilla.

340
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,620
I think that's the Sect Shape. It just hit me. I was doing Gorilla

341
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:37,720
Yeah, I was doing like sort of like Appalachian sort of scream scat which was which is also pretty fun

342
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Add in a few pieces

343
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
Oh

344
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Jonathan calm down

345
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,340
I don't know who that is

346
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,460
Whenever we do that sound but it does it just turned into animal from the muppets a little bit

347
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,500
Do you actually not know lead singer corn from the song?

348
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,820
Freak on a leash. I thought was falling away from me. Anyway, try it out next time you're with a partner

349
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,820
Please don't do this. Please we're having fun. Don't do this. Remember that there is no right or wrong way to moan

350
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
We have proven that to be

351
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,620
Categorically untrue. There's

352
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
there may only be like

353
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:36,900
four correct ways to moan and then an infinite spectrum of bad and wrong ways to moan

354
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,380
Like we can also narrow down just uh, like vowel sounds that are because like oh

355
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,140
It's not a good one. I was bad in the moment

356
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Bad

357
00:29:48,500 --> 00:30:06,740
Is classic now a lot of people don't do consonants which is interesting if you're if you're wrapped with pleasure you just be like

358
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
That's cool sandwich

359
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
I love that

360
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,940
Have you guys watched my mode have you guys been watching the bear? It's great

361
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,660
It's about a guy and he's really stressed out about these beef sandwiches

362
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,220
He makes but then he feeds them up and then he serves it to people and every episode has a special guest star

363
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,780
On it and they're very famous people

364
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,780
And then and then they'll be on that like patrick stewart will be on there and he'll be like, yeah

365
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Like what is wrong with you

366
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,740
Um, that's it for the article I don't know no no, no, no, we're just getting started

367
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,500
I mean, I can see if there's I can see if there's additional questions. There is none

368
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
Any comments?

369
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,660
Uh, no, it's got a 64 percent on uh review

370
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,060
We don't really cover that number very often. Where's that? Where's that get you that percentage?

371
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,820
Well, the way the percentages work is it's out of a hundred. I mean, I guess yeah, that's true, right?

372
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,500
It's easy to compare. Okay trav. Are you ready for trab to do his bone griffin or should I go first or um?

373
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,140
Um, I but can it be but here's my only request make it funny

374
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Okay, okay

375
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,500
Well, we've learned a lot here. Let me think. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna combo some things. Yeah, that's okay

376
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
I think that's probably the best idea. Okay

377
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
My my my my my my oh

378
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Yeah

379
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,740
That's that one I don't like

380
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Bababababababababababa

381
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Oh sound effects, he didn't even

382
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,900
Oh that's fun. I like the creaky door. Can you do the creaky door? And maybe you can even work a song in there

383
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Yeah

384
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,860
And that's all you need to do hit that note, that was really

385
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,400
I know in your head you were worried

386
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,640
that you weren't gonna get there.

387
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,560
Oh, I knew I could figure it out.

388
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,400
Okay, thank you, Griffin, for sharing that.

389
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,800
We are going to take a very brief commercial break,

390
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,160
by which I mean we're just gonna talk about brands

391
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,000
for a little bit,

392
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,680
and then we'll talk about things other than brands,

393
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
but probably we will talk about brands as well,

394
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,440
unpaid, because that's our thing.

395
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,480
Let's go to the Money Zone.

396
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:39,480
The other day, I posted this picture of Justin and I

397
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,080
at the Georgia Aquarium.

398
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,640
It's a great picture, posted on Instagram,

399
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,880
and someone said that my fit looked good.

400
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
That's all Stitch Fix, baby.

401
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, fit is good.

402
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,140
Fit is good.

403
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,280
It was Stitch Fix pants.

404
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,480
It was Stitch Fix shirt.

405
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,380
I think it was my own shoes.

406
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,280
The other ones, I think I'm just renting from Stitch Fix,

407
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,780
but it was my own shoes.

408
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,480
But I want to say thank you to Stitch Fix

409
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
for getting all of my shit together.

410
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,300
Yeah. Someone had to do it.

411
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,320
Someone had to do it, and I appreciate it.

412
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,760
You guys are also Stitch Fix boys, right?

413
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
Oh, yes. Yeah.

414
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
We should have come up with like names for,

415
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,160
like if you're a Fixie, or you're just like a-

416
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,320
A Fixer. A Fixer sounds cool, doesn't it?

417
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Oh, a Fixer, yeah.

418
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,740
Stitch, Stitch guy?

419
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,680
A Stitch, a Stitch Bitch?

420
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,040
I was about to say this is Stitch Fix,

421
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,380
then I saw that it's got a little Donald Duck

422
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,160
poking out here. Oh, that's probably not.

423
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
This is from the parks.

424
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
I got this second hand off eBay,

425
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,840
but it's the one garment I own

426
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,800
that I didn't get from Stitch Fix, everything else.

427
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,160
So, how does Stitch Fix work?

428
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,900
It's simple. Simple.

429
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,320
First, take a few minutes to set up

430
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,520
your Stitch Fix style profile.

431
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,740
Answer a few questions about what you like to wear,

432
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,180
what you don't, and how open you are to trying new styles.

433
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,080
Then, Stitch Fix expert stylist will go to work,

434
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,240
finding items exclusively for you.

435
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,200
Every piece is handpicked for you,

436
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,560
and is unique to your size, style, and in your budget,

437
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,880
which is nice. That's nice, I like that.

438
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,800
Stitch Fix will send you five pieces to try on at home.

439
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Keep what you love, and send back what you don't.

440
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,680
Shipping returns and exchanges are always free.

441
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,120
And let's be clear here.

442
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,020
Yeah, sometimes it's like pants and shirts,

443
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,160
but also sometimes, right?

444
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,900
Teresa's gotten jewelry in there.

445
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,080
I got shoes. Whoa.

446
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,960
I get all kinds of stuff, right?

447
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,200
A new car?

448
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,320
What?

449
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,200
A new car?

450
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,900
I've never gotten a new car in there yet,

451
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,800
but Stitch Fix, if you're listening, I wouldn't say no.

452
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,240
I mean, if the price is right, and if it fits me.

453
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,000
If you think these ads are good now.

454
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah, oh, give me a car.

455
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,360
Can you slide a new car in there for me?

456
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,560
Oh, yeah. I love that.

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,840
Are elephants right-handed?

464
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,280
What's the middle-est size in the universe?

465
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,160
What is the history of fan fiction?

466
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,840
Let's find out together on our show,

467
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Let's Learn Everything,

468
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,680
where we learn anything and everything interesting.

469
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,720
My name's Caroline,

470
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,640
and I studied biodiversity and conservation.

471
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,460
My name's Tom,

472
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,360
and I studied computer science and cognitive blah-blah-blah.

473
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Did you?

474
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,000
And my name's Ella, and I studied stem cells

475
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,400
and regenerative medicine.

476
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
On our show, we do as much research

477
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,980
as you would for a class,

478
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,240
but we don't get in trouble for making each other laugh.

479
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,080
And we get to say,

480
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,920
fuck.

481
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,400
Maybe not in the trailer.

Are you ready to binge watch something old?

485
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,880
The Greatest Generation is a podcast about Star Trek

486
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,440
by a couple of hosts a little bit embarrassed

487
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,960
to even have a Star Trek podcast.

488
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,080
Hosted by me, Ben Harrison.

489
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,160
And me, Adam Pranica.

490
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,460
We get into the critical, the technical,

491
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,800
the science fictional aspects of the show we love

492
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,380
while roasting it and each other at the same time.

493
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,120
We've completed an entire series

494
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,400
about Star Trek The Next Generation,

495
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,920
and another one about Star Trek Deep Space Nine,

496
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
and we've just begun Star Trek Voyager.

497
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,580
So now is a great time to start watching

498
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,920
a new Star Trek series with us.

499
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,960
So subscribe to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org

500
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,040

Justin, do one of your classic bits.

503
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,980
Yeah.

504
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,880
You sure?

505
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,140
Yeah, make it funny.

506
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Oh, yeah, okay.

507
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,600
Can I just read up?

508
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,440
Okay.

509
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,600
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, yeah.

510
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,020
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

511
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,860
Yeah.

512
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,680
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

513
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,700
I wanna munch.

514
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Squad.

515
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,520
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

516
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
I want to munch.

517
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,360
Squad.

518
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Squad.

519
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,920
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

520
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Welcome to Munch Squad.

521
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,360
It's a podcast that's a podcast profiling

522
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,100
the latest and greatest of brand eating.

523
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,940
Just real quick,

524
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,780
because I'm trying to highlight

525
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,820
what great job you guys are doing, Griffin.

526
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,820
When you said squad, you sounded exactly like Toad

527
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,560
for the Mario games and I loved it.

528
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,720
Oh, did I really?

529
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
Yeah, at least to me.

530
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
Does he yell squad a lot?

531
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,280
No, I don't think he said squad,

532
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,640
but just like the way he would do it,

533
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
it made me really happy.

534
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,640
There is a low helicopter over my house right now.

535
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,480
Oh, they found you.

536
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,240
I think it might be Joe.

537
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh, he's landing?

538
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,280
I think it might be Joseph Gordon-Biden.

539
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,640
McDonald's introduces cheese Danish to bakery menu.

540
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,200
I just wanted to mention this very briefly

541
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,360
because the lead on it says,

542
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,680
it's giving fans a tasty way

543
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,120
to switch up their seasonal routines

544
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,080
in a world of pumpkin, maple, and pecan.

545
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,580
Burn them down.

546
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,200
So I just love that McDonald's is like,

547
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,360
are you going to go with the pack?

548
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,120
Are you going to go to McDonald's?

549
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,000
Are you going to be a free thinker?

550
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
Are you going to go to McDonald's?

551
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,080
Another quick brief.

552
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,360
I just want to say, tell Wingstop to fuck off

553
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,640
because they came out with a chicken sandwich.

554
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,600
What?

555
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,680
Just go, just go ahead and put it out, no problem.

556
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,000
Your name is Wingstop.

557
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,960
You're an infant tickling yourself with a razor.

558
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
You don't know what you're doing.

559
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,080
Wingstop entered the chickens.

560
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,260
How many more?

561
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,100
How many more?

562
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,480
It's cost actual lives.

563
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
I'll keep saying it until it sinks in.

564
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,880
They're offering their sandwich

565
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,840
in the brand's 12 bold and distinct flavors.

566
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,040
Wingstop quickly revealed that customers

567
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,760
have been constrained to a category of bland,

568
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,900
where there are only options,

569
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,920
or plain, or spicy breaded sandwich.

570
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,360
The flavor craving is real.

571
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,320
With Wingstop selling out its entire supply

572
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,280
at 1600 US locations in a matter of days,

573
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,020
beating out Super Bowl Sunday transaction levels.

574
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,860
Wow.

575
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,680
Here's some key stats.

576
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,760
Are you guys ready for this?

577
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,360
They sold over a million chicken sandwiches in six days.

578
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,480
Is that a lot though?

579
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,360
Cause I don't know.

580
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,400
Yeah, I don't know either.

581
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,000
There's a lot of facts like this.

582
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,160
I mean, it seems like a lot to me.

583
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,560
Like if someone said you have to eat

584
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,600
a million chicken sandwiches in six days,

585
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,820
I'd be like, that's too many, right?

586
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,540
They sold out of, this one gets me.

587
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,380
They sold out of a four week supply in just six days,

588
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,100
with some restaurants wiped of supply

589
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,460
in as little as two days.

590
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,280
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

591
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,700
This is a new product.

592
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,580
You sent them a six day supply.

593
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah.

594
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,340
Proven.

595
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,180
What were you basing?

596
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,020
It's not a four week supply.

597
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,300
Yeah, what were you basing that number on?

598
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,720
Yeah, it's a six day supply, that's it.

599
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,580
We sent them some.

600
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,400
Why do these places insist on bragging

601
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,380
about their poor supply chain?

602
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,340
Yeah, it's brutal.

603
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
Also, how did you run out?

604
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,260
It's chicken on a sandwich.

605
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,220
Did you like, you killed all the chickens you had?

606
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,380
Like what happened?

607
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,940
You did a bad job.

608
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,620
How did you run out?

609
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,600
These eggs are not hatching fast enough.

610
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,580
How long does it take you to get more chickens

611
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,620
to the restaurant?

612
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,900
If on day one, it wasn't like,

613
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,700
oh, we used up a lot of them today, send more.

614
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
Here's another one.

615
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,300
Exceeded chicken sandwich sales expectations by 300%.

616
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,680
That's a fucking cool way of saying

617
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,080
you don't know what you're doing.

618
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,920
Yeah.

619
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,540
Like you don't believe in ourselves.

620
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,580
You should probably get somebody who can guess,

621
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,620
who can take a bite of a sandwich and be like,

622
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,380
yeah, they'll buy like a thousand of these, no problem.

623
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,300
Like you should probably hire that person to tell you

624
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,380
the viral marketing campaign for this,

625
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,700
and I'm sure you all heard about it,

626
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,500
it was number three trending on Twitter.

627
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,340
Yeah.

628
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,540
With all 100K free sandwich codes and giveaway

629
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,540
called Chicken Sandwich Split claimed in under a day.

630
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,700
Now hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

631
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,420
A million sandwiches sold, a hundred thousand of them

632
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,940
were free, seems a little inflated to me, everybody.

633
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,900
Seems like they're trying to boost the juice just a bit.

634
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,940
Just a little bit.

635
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,020
Also, once you knew all 100,000 coupons were claimed,

636
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,340
why weren't you like, we should make more?

637
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,140
We're probably gonna need more.

638
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,460
We've written so many chicken checks.

639
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,080
We have gotten, people are going to cash them.

640
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,780
They are going to, they are literally

641
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,420
going to come home to roost and we must be ready for them.

642
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,260
We have put them all in one basket

643
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,980
and I'm angry at ourselves for doing that.

644
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,820
Why didn't someone warn us before?

645
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,580
There's so many idioms about knowing

646
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,580
how many chickens or birds you have on hand

647
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,660
at any given time.

648
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,740
There's a lot of them, more than any other object.

649
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,540
Heads up, if you go to wingstop.com, which by the way,

650
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,820
traffic doubled over its usual rate at wingstop.com.

651
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,020
If you go, there's a big banner ad that just says,

652
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,900
heads up, sandwich lovers,

653
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,180
the new chicken sandwich is sold out.

654
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,700
Sorry, we fucked up so bad, it says,

655
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,220
but we really got cucked by all you sandwich-loving maniacs.

656
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
And I'm sorry. It's a supply chain issue.

657
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,580
We ran out of microchips to put into the sandwiches

658
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,980
and we got to wait for more to come in from overseas.

659
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,820
That's on us.

660
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,380
The launch of our wingstop chicken sandwich

661
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,060
in 12 flavors exceeded our expectations on all fronts,

662
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,500
says disgraced CEO, Michael Skipper,

663
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,940
who doesn't even know if his chicken sandwich is good or not.

664
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,080
So he only does a million of them.

665
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,340
People are wild about these things.

666
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,260
Our craveable product and viral campaign

667
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,440
drove unprecedented, extraordinary demand

668
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,960
for both our core guests,

669
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,620
as well as brought in a lot of new Wingstop fans

670
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,500
to the brand.

671
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,260
But don't worry, we just squandered all that potential

672
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,540
by then not having any more to sell them.

673
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,660
So any kind of goodwill and notoriety

674
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,600
we are gaining by popularity was then crushed

675
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,140
as someone came in on day seven of selling a new product

676
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,700
and we said, oh, it's out.

677
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,180
No, no. We don't have any more.

678
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,420
We didn't think anybody liked chicken and bread.

679
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,820
Thanks to strong, trusted relationships

680
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,460
with supplier partners,

681
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,020
we anticipate having chicken sandwich supply

682
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,460
back in restaurants soon.

683
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,740
So fans and new guests alike can get their hands

684
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,560
on this new favorite chicken sandwich.

685
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,820
So you can really capitalize on this moment

686
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,340
two weeks later.

687
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,420
Yeah, they can prey upon our weakness.

688
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,620
Chicken sandwich seekers can be alerted of restocks

689
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,460
by signing up for Wingstop.

690
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,300
Oh my God.

691
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,340
Get out. Get out of the town.

692
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,180
Can you imagine?

693
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,900
My wife asks me every time I get an email

694
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,340
and it makes the little email sound.

695
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,780
She's just like, just being curious,

696
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,060
taking interest in my life.

697
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,900
Who's that?

698
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,860
And I would have to say like, oh, good.

699
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,700
Oh, baby.

700
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,940
Actually, I can't fucking talk to you right now.

701
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,780
I have to get the door.

702
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,980
You're already halfway out the door.

703
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,960
Now, you don't have any shoes on.

704
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,800
What are you doing?

705
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,620
I don't care.

706
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,180
You don't understand.

707
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,220
Chicken sandwich seekers can be alerted to restocks

708
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,700
by signing up for Wingstop's digital database

709
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,020
where once back, it can be purchased at a compelling value

710
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,140
of 5.49 for an a la carte sandwich with a dip

711
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,300
or 7.99 for the combo with fries and a drink.

712
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,940
Hey guys, charge more.

713
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,620
You fucked up.

714
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,340
Charge three times.

715
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,460
You did a six days, four week supply.

716
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,600
You're charging one fourth as much as you should be.

717
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,620
Charge $30 for the sandwich.

718
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,820
Yeah.

719
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,120
Or make them a quarter smaller.

720
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,960
Like, there's a quarter the size.

721
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,380
Just make them smaller sandwiches.

722
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,460
These are sliders now.

723
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,540
Sliders, they're sliders.

724
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,660
We're cutting them.

725
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,220
I heard there was one restaurant

726
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,940
where the demand was so bad

727
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,940
that they started cutting the chicken sandwiches in half

728
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,480
and they were charging people full price,

729
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,260
but they cut the chicken sandwiches in half.

730
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,380
They ran out of halves

731
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,660
and they started cutting them into fourths.

732
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,440
And then they realized, wait a minute.

733
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,140
We've passed out many more sandwiches than we should have.

734
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,560
And they went back to the back

735
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,060
and there was more wedges of chicken sandwich.

736
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,620
And they just kept cutting

737
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,740
and there just kept being more chicken sandwich.

738
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,900
Did you guys hear about that?

739
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,500
That happened at Wingstop.

740
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,620
God's not dead.

741
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,620
He's at Wingstop.

742
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,780
He's at Wingstop.

743
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,660
And even he can't get this fucking sandwich.

744
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,920
No, no, no, no, no.

745
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,580
I do want a fucking chicken sandwich now though.

746
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,420
Yeah, I always do.

747
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,260
That's all anybody ever wants.

748
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,580
We cannot rekindle.

749
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,500
We cannot rekindle the flame of war.

750
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,140
We've moved on.

751
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,220
I'm a potter from Brisbane, Australia.

752
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,420
And I come to you, the wisest of boys for advice.

753
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,500
Every time, I'm a man, by the way.

754
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,320
I've changed the word.

755
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,480
Oh, when did that happen?

756
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,700
I'm a man.

757
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,580
We're the man, you say.

758
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,380
I can moan, I'm a man.

759
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,220
Every time I meet someone new and they ask me what I do,

760
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,580
I'm always met with some variation of the same line

761
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,380
when I tell them I'm a potter.

762
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,720
They say, like in Ghost?

763
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,540
This is something I can laugh off at first,

764
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,100
but now I find myself grinding my teeth

765
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,820
waiting for the inevitable ha-ha,

766
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,700
do you and your husband ever do the Ghost thing,

767
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,620
every time I tell them what I do.

768
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,040
Even fellow artists have asked me this.

769
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,580
Brothers, how can I tell me what my profession

770
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,900
without them thinking that I'm getting nasty

771
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,300
with some crazy-swayzee fantasy?

772
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,660
Crazy-swayzee fantasy is pleasurable.

773
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,500
Really fun to say.

774
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,540
Also, should I watch Ghost?

775
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,540
Yeah.

776
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,020
Seems like a culturally relevant flick.

777
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,620
Sorry, that's from Sorry, Ghost.

778
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,840
I don't like you like that.

779
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,140
It's weird you wouldn't check out Ghost.

780
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,580
After a while, Justin, it's a thing.

781
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,780
You've never had this happen to you

782
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,740
where someone's like, oh, you'd love it,

783
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,780
and be like, yeah, I haven't seen it, right?

784
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,580
And it's just become a thing.

785
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,220
I've never seen Avatar, the Avatar movie

786
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,460
with the blue people, never seen it.

787
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,260
Not because I'm opposed to watching it.

788
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,100
I just haven't.

789
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,660
And at this point, what's the right time?

790
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,200
You should feel happy that we don't have a Patreon,

791
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,820
because if we had a Patreon,

792
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,340
you definitely would have watched that movie by now.

793
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,160
That's probably true.

794
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,300
I definitely would have made you do

795
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,620
a commentary track to Avatar.

796
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,860
To this posse, perhaps get a-

797
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,700
The Last Airbender.

798
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,260
Perhaps, no, I would never watch that again.

799
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,380
The TV show, great.

800
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,220
Movie, boo.

801
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,060
Wow, Trav, what a bold, brave stance.

802
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,340
Bold stance that the Last Airbender movie sucks.

803
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,460
Wow, I can't believe he said it.

804
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,020
I said it, that's right.

805
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,560
Welcome to bold takes.

806
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,020
I would say to the Potter, maybe get ahead of it,

807
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,660
and say, yes, I'm a Potter,

808
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,380
and I often do that ghost thing with my husband.

809
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,120
Sometimes I just do it with a ghost.

810
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,460
Nice to meet you.

811
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,820
That could be fun.

812
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,660
Yeah.

813
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,940
You could also say, no, I don't.

814
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,180
It's actually pretty hard to stabilize

815
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,740
some clay you just threw down a wheel

816
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,980
when someone is trying to spoon you,

817
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,660
sort of sitting up spectrally.

818
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,180
I don't know if you guys have ever tried

819
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,900
to spin that good clay, that good wet mud,

820
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,220
to try to make a big urn or face.

821
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,700
It's fucking hard.

822
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,120
You are fighting the centrifugal force

823
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,300
of nature and trying your best

824
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,820
to make it not look bad or wrong,

825
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,940
and you have to really be present.

826
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,700
If you lose concentration for even a second,

827
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,940
that thing is gonna end up splatting against the wall

828
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,460
like a big pizza pie.

829
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,620
I've watched the throw down.

830
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,700
Yeah, absolutely, dude.

831
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,140
And so the last thing you need is someone behind you,

832
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,420
like, you smell good.

833
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,540
Yeah, you don't need the extra hands.

834
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,620
When I'm doing art, I don't need the help.

835
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,620
Thank you, Patrick.

836
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,500
Now, maybe you could just turn it around,

837
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,380
and they're like, do this thing.

838
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,300
And you're like, yeah, no, but what about you?

839
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,160
Do you ever fuck ghosts at your job?

840
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,700
And then see-

841
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,660
That's great.

842
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,260
I don't come to your job and tell you

843
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,100
to fuck ghosts and how to do it.

844
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,040
And now it's a conversation, you know what I mean?

845
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,740
Now we're making friends out here.

846
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,940
Does your partner ever walk up behind you

847
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,820
while you're doing someone's nails or whatever,

848
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,420
and they start spooning you in front of the customers?

849
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,380
No, weird.

850
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,820
Anyways, have you had these hors d'oeuvres?

851
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,940
Does this person meet famous baseball players and like,

852
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,060
so does an angel ever pick you up by the armpit

853
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,180
so you can jump up super high

854
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,860
to catch a home run out of the air?

855
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,660
No, I think, but the difference there is, Griff,

856
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,860
we have a lot of different ways of thinking about baseball.

857
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,260
For some reason, they did this one wild thing

858
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,620
in a Swayze movie once,

859
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,860
and it's all anybody knows about pottery.

860
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,740
Yeah, we need to get more pottery references

861
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,100
out there in society.

862
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,300
The problem is I'm thinking about a pottery-based movie,

863
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,500
and I need myself bored.

864
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,980
Like, just with a single thought.

865
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,500
And I'm not saying that pottery is boring.

866
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,140
I'm saying that watching it-

867
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,180
Pottery is boring.

868
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,380
Pottery is boring, thank you.

869
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,500
Here's what you do, Griffin, you make a pottery movie,

870
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,620
and you add in a beefy, sexy partner

871
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,340
that comes over and sits behind them,

872
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
and oh, fuck, no, I did it again.

873
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,460
I tried to fix it up.

874
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,100
You made a sexy ghost movie again.

875
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,900
It is really sexy when people do that.

876
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,100
What if instead of a ghost, it's a mummy?

877
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,500
Oh, now that's going to be a problem

878
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,580
because it's going to get the bandages real dirty.

879
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,780
Well, the bandage is going to get stuck to the vase,

880
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,180
and it's going to unwrap the mummy.

881
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,620
He's going to spin around really, really fast

882
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,100
and turn into just skeleton bones.

883
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,540
And then the bones are going to collapse,

884
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,500
and then you turn to the camera and say,

885
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,940
no bones about it.

886
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,060
That would actually be a good way of ending the conversation

887
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,780
if you were just like,

888
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,860
no, but here's a-

889
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,100
No, but I am horny for mummies, if you're curious.

890
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,540
Now, what if it was a vampire, and they're doing it,

891
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,740
and they're already in a position to bite that neck, right?

892
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,140
So as you're doing it together, they're also draining you.

893
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,220
And then they pass out, and the pot falls off and breaks,

894
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,740
and then the vampire says, well, this sucks, right?

895
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,980
And then it's like-

896
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,180
Justin, you do one now?

897
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,460
I don't actually understand the-

898
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,060
Okay, so I'll give you another example.

899
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,780
A Frankenstein monster comes up behind you,

900
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,780
and he just tries to do it, but he squishes it,

901
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,460
and then it rips one of his zombie arms off,

902
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,060
and throws it across the room.

903
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,940
And he's like, hey, can you give me a hand?

904
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,780
Oh, that's pretty good.

905
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,740
So that's the construction of the joke, Justin.

906
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,220
Now you can do one, because I know you know other monsters.

907
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,420
It's a mummy.

908
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,380
I already did a mummy one.

909
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,700
We've done mummy, vampire, and a Frankenstein monster,

910
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,540
so go ahead.

911
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,820
I did want to do a different mummy one, though.

912
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,660
Okay, okay.

913
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,480
We'll try, we'll see.

914
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,500
It's like a reboot of the mummy.

915
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,040
Oh, sure, this is the mummy too?

916
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,880
Okay.

917
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,820
No, it's a reboot of the mummy, it's different.

918
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,340
With Tom Cruise.

919
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,340
He's helping, who's in our reboot?

920
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,540
Probably Rooney Mara, and he's helping her.

921
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,900
Oh my god, Justin, that was really good, actually.

922
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,860
Yeah, this is a good poll.

923
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,500
That is who would be in the ghost reboot.

924
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,380
That's exactly who would be in mummy.

925
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,460
He's doing it for like a long time,

926
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,400
and then he's like, can we wrap this up?

927
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,940
Oh, that's pretty good.

928
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,020
That's good, but something has to happen to him violent.

929
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
Some violent thing has to happen to him in your response.

930
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,660
But then she's like, you know how Rooney Mara

931
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,860
always talks, and she's like, sure!

932
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,820
And then she jams one end of his thing

933
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,260
into the pottery wheel, and he starts like.

934
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,100
His thing?

935
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,820
Wait, wait, wait, Rooney Mara craps his dick

936
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,660
and shuts it? She takes the end

937
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,500
of the wrapping into the pottery,

938
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,460
and it starts spinning, but then it's spinning him around,

939
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,500
right, it's spinning the mummy around,

940
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,820
and peeling off his wrapping, and it's just bones.

941
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,660
Okay.

942
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,480
And they fall to the ground.

943
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,320
Now it's a skeleton.

944
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,160
And then she's like, well, that was a boner, wasn't it?

945
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,000
Oh, wait.

946
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,140
She does two different voices in the movie?

947
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,780
And two different puns?

948
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,020
She's possessed by Helen Mirren's ghost,

949
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,620
because it's teaching the mummy how to live.

950
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,980
All right, all right, all right, okay.

951
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,820
I love those.

952
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,540
So you knew that Matthew McConaughey plays the mummy.

953
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,980
I knew it!

954
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,540
You guessed that already, Griff.

955
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,380
Yeah.

956
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,400
Okay, now a werewolf comes in.

957
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,240
Yeah.

958
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,620
And the werewolf sits behind her, and they're doing it,

959
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,780
and then it stops, and she's like, what happened?

960
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,240
He goes, oh, I just had two paws.

961
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,240
So a cyborg comes in, and immediately crushes the vase

962
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,360
as soon as he touches it.

963
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah.

964
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,200
And he looks at him, and he's like, this mega bites.

965
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,720
Oh, that's very good.

966
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,120
Now what would it be if a doll came in, Griffin?

967
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,800
He would come in, and hold on, let me think of a funny joke.

968
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,520
Okay, give him a minute, Justin.

969
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Just back off, okay?

970
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,440
Give him a second.

971
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,720
Justin, just calm down.

972
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,340
He's thinking, I can see it on his face.

973
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,240
He's got it, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here it comes.

974
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,640
Oh, here it comes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

975
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,440
Here it comes, baby.

976
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,960
So he would come in, and he doesn't have arms or hands,

977
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,620
and so he would probably just look at it,

978
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:51,080
and he would be like, such beauty does not compute.

979
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,800
Beep, boop, bop, and then his shell explodes,

980
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,800
and the dog man inside of that pilots it pops out,

981
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,640
and smashes through a window, and runs off,

982
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,680
and then Doctor Who shows up, and he has a gun,

983
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,200
and he runs into the room, and he's like,

984
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,080
which way did he go?

985
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,280
And then she's like, the dog man ran out the window,

986
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,600
and you see him go to the window,

987
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,600
and just fire off a few rounds, and then he looks back,

988
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,400
and he's like, I got it.

989
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,280
And then he comes up behind Rooney Mara,

990
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,840
and he sets the, first off, he sets the gun down,

991
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,880
and then he is like, and let's try this again,

992
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,160
but we'll use some of my space clay,

993
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,380
and he sets down space clay on the wheel,

994
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,000
and when it spins this time, it doesn't just make a vase,

995
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
it makes, instead of just making a vase,

996
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,800
it makes a mirror, a little mirror,

997
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,460
and when you look inside of it,

998
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,920
you see the moment of your death.

999
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,360
And this is my new movie, Ghost.

1000
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,120
Okay, wait, hold on.

1001
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,920
You've lost it, you've lost it, and we've lost it,

1002
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
and by it, I mean the time that we had a lot of.

1003
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,440
Darth Vader comes in.

1004
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,160
Okay, thank you, Griffin, I really appreciate you

1005
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,000
for that great back contribution.

1006
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,880
How many hands are on the mirror at this point, Griffin?

1007
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,040
It's not a mirror anymore, it went back to being a vase.

1008
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,960
Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool.

1009
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,360
This is our podcast, and we very much appreciate you

1010
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,440
being here, I hope you've got that new Montaigne album.

1011
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,760
Good lord almighty, it fucking slaps good.

1012
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,720
It slaps real good.

1013
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,600
They did a real nice job on that one.

1014
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,120
They did a great job cranking that one out.

1015
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,640
Oh, yeah, great, and what's the name of that one?

1016
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,760
Where can we find it, where can we find it?

1017
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,160
If you search Montaigne.

1018
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,920
If you search Montaigne, it'll pop up.

1019
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,720
Point, but the new album is called Making It.

1020
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,040
It's got a very cool cover, it's got lots of good songs.

1021
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,520
I mean, come on, it's a slam.

1022
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Power ranking of the songs, I'm gonna say,

1023
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,600
now in space, still number one, up in my book,

1024
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
I like In the Green Room, strong start.

1025
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,980
Of course, you can't always be you with David Byrne.

1026
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,840
Just a fucking great album.

1027
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,320
Y'all have to listen to this one.

1028
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,080
I'm very excited that she put J.C.Ultra on it too.

1029
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,720
Yes, absolutely.

1030
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,720
Hey, thank you to Max 1 Fun.

1031
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,000
Fun fact, actually fun fact about J.C.Ultra.

1032
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,080
Montaigne sent J.C.Ultra to us

1033
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,480
when we first started talking about doing the theme song.

1034
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,880
Montaigne sent a demo of J.C.Ultra,

1035
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,520
and she was like, what do you think of this energy,

1036
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,960
this vibe, and I was like, that's fantastic.

1037
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,320
But that was the song that I'd heard

1038
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,120
where I was like, yes, she has to, anyway,

1039
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,040
that's on the album, it's one of the good songs.

1040
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,480
Thank you to Max 1 Fun for having us on the network.

1041
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,000
Lots of great shows there, lots of great jokes,

1042
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,400
and lots of good education too.

1043
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
They got jokes, education,

1044
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,300
sports, sports.

1045
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,040
Some hot takes in there as well.

1046
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,640
Oh, we have some live shows coming up

00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,080

You're welcome.

1073
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,360
Griffin, did you have an inspirational quote

1074
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,520
for us to wrap it all up?

1075
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,160
Yeah, don't let anybody push you around.

1076
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,360
Don't let anybody push you around into doing bits

1077
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,960
that you don't wanna do anymore.

1078
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,400
Don't let anybody tell you you have to do bits

1079
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,880
that you don't wanna do anymore.

1080
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,600
Cause you don't fucking have to.

1081
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,440
Got it.

1082
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,280
My name is Justin McElroy.

1083
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1084
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,640
You were here at the same time as everyone else.

1085
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,640
You were here at the same time as everyone else.

1086
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,400
You don't, it's not like you were last

1087
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,840
to call your seat in the car.

1088
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,440
And so you have to do a bit at the end of the show

1089
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,280
for 12 fucking years.

1090
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,400
My brother, my brother, me.

1091
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,240
Kiss your dad somewhere on the lips.

1092
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,760
You don't have to do that anymore.

1093
00:58:44,760 --> 00:59:05,680
It's better with you.

1094
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,360
It's better with you.

1095
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,160
My life is better with you.
