1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, please welcome to the stage your friends and mine, the McElroy brothers, my brother, my brother and me.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And if I show for the modern era like Chilean miners, we've emerged here on the stage of X Fun Con. I'm so excited to be here. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can't wait for your applause. We got too many goofs to give you.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We gotta throw all our entourage material out there.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't do it. I can't do it.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I cannot believe, Jesse, you gave us the hangover slot again.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Three times we have Dumbass Fun Con.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Every year, 10 a.m.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
10 a.m. we get the hangover slot.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sunday at 10 a.m.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Jesse knows, he throws us into the briar patch on an annual basis.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Much like everyone Eminem interacts with in the movie 8 Mile, he knows that adversity is gonna make us strong.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So this year we just leaned into it.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, this is, by the way, my brother, my brother and me, face-to-face live 16.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He ain't funny, he's my brother.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a PowerPoint presentation that I have prepared to go along with the show.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Justin, I will tear for you.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a special PowerPoint presentation just for the right side of the audience.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry, left side.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ah, man, you're missing some classic shit.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Justin wrote some words on some paper.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So we're doing the hangover slot again.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Does anybody have, stepping outside the bit here for a minute, let's get real.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Anybody having ibuprofen in the bottle?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I need to see you take it out of the ibuprofen bottle.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it in the ibuprofen bottle?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If it's a ziplock bag.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, like a ziplock bag can be sealed?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, tamper proof, that is ideal.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, wonderful.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Griffin has brought us back around to one of the treacherous parts about doing the hangover slot.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is that it's not just the audience that is very hungover.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It is also the performers.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh my god, thank you so much.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you know what's your name?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Susie.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You've saved the show.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Travis, I was wondering, I'll stand up and fan away for you if you could walk me through the rules of doing the hangover slot.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You got it.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is an advice show, by the way, in case you couldn't guess.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Has anybody not listened to the show before?

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now hold on, Justin, hold on.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's just one person, okay, thank god.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If we ever ask that question and nobody yells, then we just ascend into the hangover.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, so this is rule number one of the hangover show.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Be cool.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hope one of these, hold on, I have a pill in my mouth.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What am I doing?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's what we do here.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We drink champagne, we take drugs.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I hope one of these rules is don't yell or clap.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, Jay Town.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You could file that under being cool.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not cool to clap or laugh very loud.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, rule number two.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, you were doing so good with two hands that you thought...

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Rule number two.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Rule number two is come on, come on.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So this one's more of a punitive statute.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, and once you've forgotten rule number one, be cool.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And then you get to rule number two, come on.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, we're in the hangover slot.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, rule number three.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's doing it.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Nice, nice.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So this one is a bit more congratulatory.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You've done it.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At the end, you're packing up your bag and you're thinking, nice.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Nice.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I really follow those rules those guys gave me.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is there more?

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, here's the thing.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To embrace the hangover nature of this show,

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we didn't pull any email questions.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We're going to do all audience questions.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So rule number four.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How about for being in a briar patch?

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, and remember, no bummer questions.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why did you...

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hold on, no, don't clap for this.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't clap for this.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have struck through.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't clap for the slide of the PowerPoint presentation.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, that's like a no with a slap.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So they're like, oh, that...

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's a no sign.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, so left side of the audience.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Left side and maybe a few people who can't see

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
because they're listening to a podcast.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There may be one or two of them that are in the room physically.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It says no bummer questions,

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but the word no has the strike through no sign around it.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I swear to God, if you just sullied the show with bummer questions,

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
if you just flooded the field...

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's iconography.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now they can look at it and be like, oh, I remember the no.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, my God.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So this actually...

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you remember one thing from this show, it's no.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We have given you guys like 260 hours

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
of free entertainment content at this point.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Can we just have one Jimmy episode

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
where we just sit here in absolute silence?

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Everybody put your heads down.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're going to turn Jumanji on.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like in school, when the teacher doesn't want to teach that day,

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
it's a Jumanji day.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Could you put on the first hour of Jumanji?

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just play Jumanji?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Nick, if you could just play Aladdin in Spanish

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because that's a Spanish class.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How about instead we jump into things with the yahooing?

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, in case you're worried about the show being bad, don't worry.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As you fail us, we have some bulletproof show savers

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that we will tear in case of mediocrity.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These are going to save the show if things go wrong.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Can we pivot the fucking board

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
towards the left side of the audience at all?

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We can turn it flat, but then nobody gets it.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're going to knock that over?

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're going to break a speaker?

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's show saver five.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'd ruin the stage.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How about this yahoo?

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sometimes we read yahoo answers on the show from the internet

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
that mainly two people in the audience...

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And this is not...

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm talking, of course, about Drew Davenport and Rachel Sperling.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You guys can stand up.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Get your accolades.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Drink it in.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Drew's the one with the beard.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Last night at the Purple Party,

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I literally saw those two having a rap battle

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with a circle around them,

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
but they were just reading funny things off their phones

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that they had dug up.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And like screaming at each other.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like, oh, get this one.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, Griffin, read a question for the yahoo answer service

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that we will then answer.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All right.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to go to Drew first.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Drew Davenport sent this one in.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Level 9000.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, Drew Shaman.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Drew Davenport, thank you.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's by a anonymous user who asks,

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
where would parents hide condoms?

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Recently, I've been hearing my parents in the bedroom at night.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want to find their condoms to embarrass them.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've searched their room and their bathroom

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
anywhere I should look or double check.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
These kids are real encyclopedia brown.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So precocious.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It all makes sense when you realize this was their first kid.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So yeah, I bet they use a lot of protection.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Everybody's got a hollowed out book, right?

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That they hide all their Jimmy caps in.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You got grossed out by the term Jimmy caps?

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Jim was literally handing out a trash bag full of condoms

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
before the show.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And you all are like, hmm, slang terms?

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, thank you.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's right there.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There's a giant bag of condoms circling the audience.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I like the one condom that comes in the gift bag.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because that says to me, you're going to be somebody special,

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and it's not going to go great enough that you want to go together.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a real one off.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is how, oh man, how old, how young can you be

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to do this level of a power move on your parents?

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because you are the dad.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's up, Bryce?

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now I'm the dad.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll be going to work from now on.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's hard though, if you do it too young,

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you could end up in a blank check situation

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
where you are too young to take care of yourself.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is that what happened in blank check?

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He became the dad of his family?

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He found his dad's condoms, fucking made them rain on him.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I said give me a million dollars or I'll tell everyone.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't want this to get out, do you, dads?

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You have safe sex with your wife.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The world will know.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Where do parents hide?

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where's a cool place for parents to hide things?

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The best place to hide anything is the last place someone would expect.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I bet they hide their condoms on their penis.

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You'd think that would be the first place someone would look.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I would get rigorous about it.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I would take 30 paces from the back door.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's an old oak tree.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh man, I'm so ready to make love to you, Sheila.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's going to be so great and hot and sweaty.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I need 20 minutes, I need to go out to the shed.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I just got to go geocache some condoms real quick.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I would have a safe with a scanner and those lasers.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
A painting hanging over it.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Lasers that you have to climb through,

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but you could do it in a sexy way that would heighten the mood.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wait, hold on. Stop.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is just for you people in the room.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Justin, show them sexy once more.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like that scene from Entrapment.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He looks like he has no bones.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Got some Entrapment fans in the audience.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Could you hide it inside of the painting covering the safe?

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Whoa, and you have to enter the painting like it's Super Mario?

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The condoms are buried in Bob-omb's Battlefield under the chain chomps.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's why the ghost is covering its eyes.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, because I want to see.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sex is beautiful and natural.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's a new man running through Super Mario World.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Clever condoms.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Justin, could you do the first show saver, please?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do we need it?

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Shit, I thought we were doing all right.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's ask the audience.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, not for a question, Dimitri.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Though I like your spirit.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Can we wait on the show?

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's see how bad Dimitri's question is.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Dimitri, come on up.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Welcome, Dimitri.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I need a verbal confirmation that you understand the rules of engagement.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No bummers.

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is the mic hot?

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Blow into them.

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is that what Tom was talking about in his podcast last?

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Always blow into your mic.

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's the best quality you can do.

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Me and my boyfriend have been together for three and change years.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We've been together for a while, too.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We're trying to figure things out.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's about the next step, but neither one of us...

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We cannot find a formula to decide which of us is supposed to propose.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is easy.

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We would both like to be the one that does not propose.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's the twist.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was going to say simultaneous proposals.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You each get down on one knee, opposite knees.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You tie your legs together.

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's a three-legged race.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This could be an amazing business opportunity for me.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I am pretty good at proposing.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think I did a pretty good job.

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
A surrogate proposer for just this situation.

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
A third party that will come in and surprise you at Lowe's.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe you're shopping for...

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You go to Lowe's and you get all the stuff you put in the house.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
All the things you put in the house.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Windows, doors, walls.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Your partner is like, what are you doing?

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why are you getting all these things?

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is for the house and the wife.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's a proposal.

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Did you not understand the fucking question?

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's super romantic.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're going to fill a cart with a house.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then you hand it off to your stunt double, Griffin.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He steps in and does the heavy lifting.

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You say the thing I say, then you stare silently.

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You call Griffin and tell him you're ready.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He wakes up and takes a shower and gets dressed.

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Then drives to where you are and then doesn't.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You have to stand in silence the whole time with just a house in your cart.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I would do a good job.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Would anybody here trust me to propose for them in a way that felt right for them?

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We would need to do a thorough interview.

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, no, no. These are jokes.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
At least I'm not going to do this right now.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, no, no.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What the fuck?

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, you guys are bad.

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We ain't doing this.

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, we can do it if you want.

285
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Be cool.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We're not getting into another goddamn Milwaukee situation.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We've got a full blown walkie.

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
People waffled on a proposal for 45 minutes and I was trapped in a Hellraiser experience.

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But yeah, I think that works for you. Did we do it good?

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, you did a great job.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Cool.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you, Denitri.

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You doing one on the ripcord?

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't know what these are going to be.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just want to say some shit about those two horses.

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
People seem to like that and I want to play the favorites here.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
One time my parents saw Gordon Lightfoot and the first thing he says is,

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
while I haven't announced it to everybody, I will not be playing the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And half the audience still opened their eyes.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, Gordon, that's what we wanted. It came to here, my friend.

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What does that have to do with... Oh, I get it.

302
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, I see.

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Play the hits.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're saying Ghosts and Horses is our wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So, here's my question. Has anybody experienced any paranormal activity since they've been here?

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Or equestral activity?

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Or the rare paranormal slash equestral activity, Equestrian, right?

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Dammit.

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No takers.

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Right there.

311
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Did you see a ghost?

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, but I made some horse stamps.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You made horse stamps into stamps.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's the best sentence I've ever heard anybody say, ever.

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What was the sentence, Griffin?

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, throw it up here.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is the greatest camp of all time. Get on up here.

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, shit. God, he's fucking...

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's a good... That's a good...

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Will you just say that sentence out loud again?

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

323
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't think we've ever had a full sentence be the title of the episode before.

324
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So, this is very exciting for me.

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I made a card with some of the, like, secondary impressions.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So, the first one is, like, the brightest, and then it gets lighter as the...

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
As the potato degrades.

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
As the potato quality diminishes.

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The half blushes.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And so, I made one with the secondary impressions.

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Looks like ghost horses.

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll get it out of my bag for you later.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, terrific. I'm very much looking forward to that.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
One more time. Just stop. Wait, just one more time.

335
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Can you say that wonderful sentence?

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Can you cast that spell on me just one more time?

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Say the sentence, and then say your name after it like you're quoting yourself.

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I made some potato stamps.

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No shit!

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Try again. I can do it.

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am cool with, I made some potato stamps in horse class.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Bailey Curran.

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Nice.

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well done.

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

348
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Should we do a Yahoo?

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, this fits in very nicely.

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is another Davenport jam.

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Smooth transition.

352
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Neighbor child.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I tweeted before the show that I needed more Yahoos, and Drew tweeted back,

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll just hand you some.

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Thank you, Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Lane, who asks,

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Are there any lawyers that deal with spiritual and mentophysical crime?

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I know there is no information to be found anywhere, and they don't burn witches anymore,

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
so what's the replacement?

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Thanks, Obama.

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Or did we just give up to a decent meal and carnal creature comforts as the best and safest life can be?

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Wow.

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't read that part before it.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Are we not safe enough?

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I feel pretty safe on a day-to-day basis.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Have you taken any preparations?

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Against mentophysical crime?

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, the first step in that preparation process would be Googling what the fuck that is.

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But, Griffin, what if your house gets robbed by a Boogler?

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, that's really good.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey, Chad. Hey, Chad.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, no, I need a minute.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How would his spectral hands even grasp my belongings, checkmates?

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's a good point, though.

374
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They caught him dead-handed.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Shit, damn.

376
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is going to be a Travis episode.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I owe Jesse Sid everything, and I did a very good job.

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I definitely got the right performers for my convention.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Listen, these are a talent group.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Did you hear the thing that one said about Booglers?

381
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey, I'm writing that down.

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll never know when I might need a joke like that.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Travis, come on.

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're right.

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you get haunted, though,

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
if you get car-crashed by a ghost driver, there's no recourse.

387
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's true.

388
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There's no special courts or anything.

389
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Would the lawyer slash judge slash jury

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
also need to be a ghost?

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

392
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes, for real, for sure.

393
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I feel like a jury of your peers would have to be a ghost.

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, jury of your peers would have to be a ghost.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Near-death experience, though, I think is the least you can ask for.

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, so like a judge who's been dead for like a minute.

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, shh, shh, shh.

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But they're all ghosts because the jury was hanged?

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's nothing.

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Fucking forget it.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, I got jealous of Travis and I...

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Who can blame you?

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He does great jokes.

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's not fair.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I was so drunk eight hours ago.

406
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How could you do this to me?

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Should we get someone else up here to ask a question?

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can see this hand first.

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Whoever wants to walk up to the stage.

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
First person to stand up, first person.

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yay!

413
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
God, these seats are so close together,

414
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we should have thought about this better.

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hello?

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
First, what is your name?

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
My name is Solomon.

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hi, Solomon.

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've never talked into a microphone before.

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, get up first.

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It doesn't stop us.

422
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Solomon, we need verbal confirmation

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that you understand the rules.

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, no bummers.

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No bummers.

426
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I have a Patreon.

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I run a Patreon where I make comics and art and stuff.

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And so, you know, Patreon works.

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, for sure.

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay, so I have rewards that go up to $25

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and you get like comics in the mail.

432
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sold.

433
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So what's like the next tier?

434
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Above comics?

435
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No, above $25.

436
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
More comics, double comics.

437
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I gotta blow their minds and get their money.

438
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
For how much money?

439
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's it, that's up to us.

440
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
More than $25.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What's more than $25?

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
For $25, you send them some comics.

443
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For $25 million, you make them a blockbuster movie.

444
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No, you buy them a blockbuster video.

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Can you do, for $50, two comics?

446
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
For $50, they can send you comics.

447
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The best gift you could give,

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the best thing you could do is give a gift that everybody wants

449
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but they would never purchase for themselves

450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and ask exact sticker price for the donation.

451
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So by which I mean $25 gets you some comics,

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
$5,297.99 is gonna get you a Kawasaki jet ski.

453
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So you're suggesting that you use Patreon to...

454
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Launder.

455
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Sell speedboats.

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Ooh, okay, for $50, you'll give them $30.

457
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If I saw that, I wouldn't be able to pass it off.

458
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's free $30 right there.

459
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I do need the money.

460
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I lost my cloud two weeks ago.

461
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm gonna send that $50.

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Is this a Ponzi scheme?

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't know what that is.

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's the comic about, can I ask?

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, the main comic is a porn comic.

466
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Fantastic.

467
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We're four minutes into this question.

468
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I make other kinds of comics too.

469
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Not interested, thank you.

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Can you include them in your sex comics at a certain, like $100?

471
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But not participate, just as a spectator runs my body.

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wait, wait, wait, include them in your sex comics

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
but make them look 10% sexier than they do in real life.

474
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Naked.

475
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Then, when you are trying to woo someone,

476
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
you say, oh, I've got a comic book in which I'm depicted naked,

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
would you like to see that?

478
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But the ding dong is bigger or something?

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The butt looks bigger in the comic

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and then they think your ding dong is real big.

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Foolproof.

482
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You're saying, you're trying to make a connection,

483
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
an intimate, a skintimate connection with somebody.

484
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You say, I am literature for you.

485
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And then I need you to sign this NDA.

486
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think we helped.

487
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I think, did we do it?

488
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Does that help?

489
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, definitely.

490
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you.

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Wait, wait, wait, do you want to plug your Patreon really quick

492
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
because you didn't give anybody any way to find it.

493
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, my Patreon is just my name,

494
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
all one word, Solomon Fletcher,

495
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and the comic is called Goldie and the Bears,

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
like Goldilocks.

497
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
There it is.

498
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
With dudes.

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Enjoy.

500
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Fuck yeah.

501
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Nice.

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That was the original premise of our podcast.

503
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It was critically reviled.

504
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Should we do a show saver?

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, let's do a show saver.

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Show saver number two.

507
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Show saver two is ask people to cheer

508
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
for previous Max Fun Con performers

509
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
in the hopes that they will mingle the memories of the shows

510
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and will look back on your show somewhat fondly.

511
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's hear it for SuperEgo.

512
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
My brother and me think about us now.

513
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't clap, just think about us.

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How about those stand up comedians last night, right?

515
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Us, us, us.

516
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You enjoyed yourselves.

517
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You had a good time at the podcast.

518
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
International Waters, am I right?

519
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There is only my brother and my brother and me.

520
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is only my brother and my brother and me.

521
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's hear it for my brother and my brother.

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No, wait, fuck.

523
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You fucked it up.

524
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Shit.

525
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Did you enjoy your classes?

526
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You learned much more from my brother and me.

527
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You learned more at our show.

528
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I made a horse stamp a potato class.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Well, that was from before.

530
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We do own that one.

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We did actually do that one.

532
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So remember that one if you want.

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We're going to take a quick break to talk about our sponsors this week.

534
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We're sponsored by MeUndies, a friend of the show.

535
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
They've sponsored us a couple of times.

536
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We love them.

537
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Hopefully you know about it by now.

538
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hopefully you've seen all the pictures of me online wearing it.

539
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Anytime you see a picture of anybody...

540
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm wearing them right now.

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Anytime you see a picture of anybody online wearing MeUndies, that's my butt and my body.

542
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
MeUndies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear.

543
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But here's the thing, MeUndies isn't just for guys.

544
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They just launched their All of Me women's collection.

545
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's a four piece line of undies designed specifically for the female body.

546
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
In all of its complex, gorgeous as hell glory.

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Again, I thought that maybe it would be more comfortable for me to hear you say that the second time.

548
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It got less.

549
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It actually aged in a peculiar way.

550
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Next time we just need to hire someone to come in and read that part.

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Just that part.

552
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Who do you think?

553
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Like Zac Efron?

554
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Maybe Zac Efron.

555
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
To get 20% off, you can go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

556
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

557
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's totally worth it.

558
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You should already be doing this right now.

559
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm ashamed of you that you haven't done it yet.

560
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Travis, if you had a powerful hunger right now, what would be an arm's reach for you to consume?

561
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, that would be MeUndies.

562
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
No.

563
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, I mean you could eat...

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, sorry.

565
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Nature Fuck.

566
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The closest you see where you're going with that.

567
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You're not a goat.

568
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You've actually got this bowl of four limes here.

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And I want...

570
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
No, those are decorative.

571
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
This is your centerpiece.

572
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's a big, big bowl just to set the stage.

573
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
A big, big, big glass bowl with four little limes in it.

574
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, to give you an idea Griffin, Theresa and I challenged ourselves and we bought a whole like four pound bag of limes.

575
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's all that's left.

576
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, a lime dare.

577
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But sitting right next to me to my immediate right is Nature Box from Parmesan Garlic Pop Pops and some Pistachio Power Clusters, which are my new favorite snack.

578
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Absolutely delicious.

579
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They're sponsoring us this week.

580
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They're made with zero artificial flavors.

581
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
They're Nature Box.

582
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What?

583
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Nature Box.

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You see Nature Box?

585
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Not Pistachio Power Clusters.

586
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
They've got zero grams of trans fat and no high fructose corn syrup.

587
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That stuff's bad, I think.

588
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can grab mini Belgian waffles, strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How many?

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Sweet and salty.

591
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What?

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
How many Belgian waffles?

593
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Mini Belgian waffles.

594
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you can get a free trial box of their favorite snacks.

595
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's pretty great.

596
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I assume at this point we're just like preaching.

597
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Everybody's going, yeah, I know.

598
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm already subscribed to Nature Box.

599
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I know.

600
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm eating them now.

601
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I've got tight sexual underwear stuffed with Pistachio Power Clusters.

602
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Who's this next message for?

603
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I've got a message here for...

604
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I have a message here for Joe Zabadoo.

605
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
My keyboard is...

606
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
No, just kidding.

607
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's RJ Zamudio.

608
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
RJ Zamudio, this message is for you, pal.

609
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And it's from Mitch Bones, who says,

610
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Sorry that this candle night's gift is so late.

611
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yup.

612
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I debated on this or a miniature adult hippo in a small cage.

613
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I was going to blame this being late on the brothers, but I just now got around to it.

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Thanks so much for being my best friend before this.

615
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, I added that.

616
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He just said best friend.

617
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If you didn't know, you were my best friend.

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, you are now because it's canon.

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
P.S. Shout out to Catland and Travis.

620
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And then he died.

621
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then he died while I was typing.

622
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It sounded like maybe you had only one letter to go.

623
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Isn't it ironic?

624
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We have one more message for Em from B.

625
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Just says, Happy birthday, sweet cheese.

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This is so mysterious.

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Do you know how off the grid you have to be before you're...

628
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Of the two people in a relationship, the only letters you're allowed to slip out are E and M and a B.

629
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah.

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's really off the grid.

631
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
These are some double agent...

632
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is some 007 secret agent shit though, right?

633
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

634
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We're going to get another one from B to M.

635
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's like the crow flies at midnight.

636
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh, BM.

637
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
BM, guys.

638
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Before we go back to the show real quick, we just wanted to say a quick thank you to Maximum Fun for having us at Max Fun Con.

639
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We do that in the show there later.

640
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I know, but I want to say it now.

641
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Okay.

642
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Everybody who came out, everybody who made the show possible, Lake Arrowhead for being so incredibly great.

643
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And yeah, it was just a super fun weekend.

644
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And thanks for inviting us, Max Fun.

645
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So when sales go up for Maximum Fun 2016, get your tickets.

647
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Get your tickets.

648
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Get there.

649
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
If you've never been before, you need to go.

650
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's like the most fun thing.

651
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It sells out instantaneously.

652
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So do not sleep.

653
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay.

654
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Back to the show.

655
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, man.

656
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
This is good.

657
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hey, Max Fun listeners.

658
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm Dave Holmes.

659
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And if you've been missing my show, International Waters, you've been missing this.

660
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I am aroused, but I have zero idea.

661
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Really?

662
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Are you really?

663
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

664
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sorry.

665
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Name a British food lady.

666
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Name a British food lady.

667
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Julia Childs.

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm afraid I can't accept that.

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No, it was not Julia.

670
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No.

671
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Come on.

672
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You must know your British food ladies.

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
International Waters, a panel show where US and UK comedians battle for pop culture supremacy.

Subscribe right now on iTunes or at MaximumFun.org.

675
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Hey, guys.

676
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I have a Yahoo answer.

677
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Okay.

678
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinsey.

679
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Thank you, Zoe Kinsey.

680
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Loud and loud.

681
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user SC-MHM.

682
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And that chemical compound asks, what is a good comeback when somebody tells you to stick

683
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
your head in gravy?

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Best answer.

685
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If it's a chick, just say, I didn't know you were into food play.

686
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Then go stick your little head in gravy and have a good time with her.

687
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh, winky face.

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why did you decide to read this?

689
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
This is the fucking worst two sentences.

690
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No, don't read.

691
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We're not reading the second part.

692
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
No, I'm not reading that next one.

693
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It is upsetting.

694
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It says the word cock in the second part.

695
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, Griffin, come on.

696
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Let's get start over.

697
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm going to use my time machine.

698
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So I'll be the only person who's experienced this part so far.

699
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Boop.

700
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Why haven't I left?

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Hey, Chad, what's the best answer?

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Oh, the best answer is if it's a chick.

703
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What is a good comeback when somebody tells you to stick your head in gravy?

704
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
If somebody says, dip your head in gravy, I just look them straight in the eye and say,

705
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
which barrel?

706
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Now, the other thing is I have several barrels of gravy.

707
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Artisanal barrel aged gravy.

708
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Just like grandpa used to make.

709
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Our gravy sits in barrels for over 76 years.

710
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Remember that slow walk out to the larder to get some gravy with papa?

711
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Now you can have that great taste in a cellophane package.

712
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Austin Fawns remembers.

713
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What if you say back to them, what's gravy?

714
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And they're like, it's like super dope.

715
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's when you mix like milk in with flour and you add spices to it.

716
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And then you say, I got you.

717
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I knew what gravy was before.

718
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then you've got the power.

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Thank you.

720
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Take a bow, Griffin.

721
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Just one of my many pranks.

722
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
His classic pretend you don't know what gravy is prank.

723
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Get some every time.

724
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How about, can you just say, no, fuck you.

725
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
No.

726
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Go fuck yourself.

727
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No.

728
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I would drown and I would hate that.

729
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think.

730
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We had a good drive up here.

731
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It took us five hours from Los Angeles, which is not great.

732
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But we did stop for supplies on the way up the hill.

733
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I want to tell you guys this fable.

734
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We stopped at a place called the one stop supermarket.

735
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I want to.

736
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay.

737
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I want to interrupt you, Justin.

738
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay.

739
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
First time ever.

740
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And say, we were going to stop at Jensen's.

741
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah.

742
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes.

743
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Hi, Mr. Jensen.

744
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Thank you for coming to the show.

745
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And we were like, well, we should stop before we get on the mountain because God knows how

746
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
long that will take.

747
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Right.

748
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And we were going to go to a different supermarket.

749
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And then we were driving by the one stop market.

750
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And Griffin said like, oh, we can just go there.

751
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And as we're like pulling in, it was like, yeah, this is fine.

752
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's fine.

753
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's a supermarket.

754
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I go in and the shelves are just, there's just like things on the shelves.

755
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Like, oh, there's a blanket.

756
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

757
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why is there an unwrapped blanket just lying on the shelf?

758
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But that didn't deter me.

759
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
My baby needs food.

760
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm a provider.

761
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So I go in there and I get a basket full of baby food, get everything her little tummy

762
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
could desire.

763
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I go up to check out and the gentleman picks up the first container and he stops

764
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and he looks at it.

765
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He says, I do have to tell you, this is baby food and this is expired.

766
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Then he sets it down and picks up the next container, sets it down next to the first

767
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
container.

768
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This dude goes through like seven containers of expired baby food, has two that are unexpired

769
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and then looks at me as if our purchasing transaction is going to continue.

770
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
At this point, like we have not reached the off ramp for this particular transaction was

771
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
back when you told me some of the baby food is expired.

772
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Like, well, let me check that date.

773
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, that's that bad boy off.

774
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Let's go to town.

775
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The best part of the story is the line.

776
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Now this is baby food, so I'm going to shoot you straight.

777
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm not going to screw you over on this one.

778
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
This will kill a baby for sure.

779
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The other thing is that dude looks straight at the date on the baby food as if to say,

780
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm not going down this road again.

781
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I know what we sell here is expired baby food.

782
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And then we had to make a second stop.

783
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So bad name for your store.

784
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
One stop super market.

785
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I want to get another person up here.

786
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay.

787
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

788
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yes.

789
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Awesome haircuts.

790
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Solid haircuts.

791
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Hi.

792
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Hi.

793
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What's your name?

794
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
My name is Amy.

795
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Amy.

796
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Amy.

797
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Do you understand the rules?

798
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No bummers.

799
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Right.

800
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Right.

801
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No.

802
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Here's my question.

803
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I was at grandma's funeral and...

804
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Sorry, what was the question?

805
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay.

806
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So I volunteer with a quilt and textiles museum.

807
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A lot of quiltsies in the house.

808
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

809
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And I've been tasked with trying to figure out how to make quilts more hip.

810
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We got to sex up these quilts.

811
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm on a youth council.

812
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
If that tells you anything about the usual.

813
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay.

814
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Let's give me an age demo.

815
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Cause I like stitch the cast of girls into the pictures of them.

816
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Not their flesh.

817
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Do not.

818
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh, this is important.

819
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh my gosh.

820
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
This is important.

821
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Do not render the flesh of the cast of girls into quilts and textiles.

822
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
They will hate that.

823
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And it is a crime.

824
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
What's the age?

825
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
What are we shooting for?

826
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We're going from 20 to 59.

827
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
20 to 59.

828
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Okay.

829
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So the current demographic of the museum.

830
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
60ish?

831
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah.

832
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Plus.

833
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That seems intentional.

834
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Like, okay, here's your age range.

835
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Anybody but 60 years.

836
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
They are fully engrossed in the quilting lifestyle.

837
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Maybe some quotes from Fault in Our Stars.

838
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You sew right in there.

839
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, I thought you said quilts from Fault in Our Stars.

840
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I haven't seen it.

841
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I assumed it was very cool.

842
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We're going down a line of thinking right now, which is that if you craft this one perfect quilt,

843
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it will set the world free.

844
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You guys got to think bigger.

845
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You got to think like.

846
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Maybe you get a celebrity.

847
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson loves his sister.

848
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson loves to quilt.

849
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
He loves to quilt.

850
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, you get a picture of him on Quilt Magazine.

851
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, that's what it's called.

852
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Quilt Magazine.

853
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You should see if you can get a picture of Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

854
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
He's got a quilt around his shoulders.

855
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And on the front of the magazine, it says, too fast, too meticulous.

856
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
He didn't come into the series until Fast Five.

857
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
How about just Quilt Five?

858
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Could we get picnics popping off?

859
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Are you saying that if we get picnics coming back in a big, big way,

860
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
then Quilt Fever will fall right behind?

861
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

862
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And then your night job at the basket factory is going to also explode.

863
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's an investment in every facet of your career.

864
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That would be a great app.

865
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It lists all the picnics in your area you should go join.

866
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And now we're putting people together.

867
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You get to cover picnics monthly.

868
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson says, too fast, too luxurious.

869
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And you're having him eat a picnic basket.

870
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Are picnics known for their luxuries?

871
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Too fast, too fast, too sumptuous.

872
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Picnics are the worst, and everybody hates them,

873
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but we can still keep doing them.

874
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What about, sorry, this is a rich vein.

875
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Can we get a tagline going that's like,

876
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Quilts is like a hundred little blankets in one,

877
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
all sewed up together.

878
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I like that.

879
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, I did it.

880
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I did it, guys.

881
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It was me.

882
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yay.

883
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Let's say, should we show the room?

884
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah.

885
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh, that museum.

886
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

887
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
All right.

888
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Quilts.

889
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles.

890
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Does anybody see all there?

891
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
This is the after party of the Quilt Museum.

892
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What do you got?

893
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What do you got, Show Saver?

894
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Show Saver 3.

895
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
See if Baby is doing any cute baby tricks or stunts.

896
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Baby is not in the room.

897
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Nope.

898
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Baby by the door.

899
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Everyone look at the baby.

900
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Look at the baby.

901
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh my God, she waved.

902
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yay.

903
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Hi, Charlie.

904
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Hi.

905
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Everybody remember the feeling you feel right now.

906
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The feeling you associate with our show.

907
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Remember this.

908
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Remember this moment.

909
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Remember this one.

910
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Not the other one.

911
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Not where Travis said Boogler.

912
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Remember this.

913
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Remember this feeling.

914
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Thanks, Chuck.

915
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Thanks, Charlie.

916
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Thanks, Baby.

917
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You got anything else in the tank?

918
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Nope.

919
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Just putting your hand in your mouth.

920
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh, yes.

921
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's good.

922
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Remember this.

923
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Sorry, I have my email open.

924
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Rachel, are you sending in questions during the show?

925
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:19,000
While we're waiting for the doors to open.

926
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Okay.

927
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm both hurt and honored.

928
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm flipping through them right now because I want to drop a Sperling joint on the crowd.

929
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What's the best one you sent in?

930
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, no.

931
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There's somebody who wants a book blurb.

932
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh, for sure.

933
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay.

934
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This one was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

935
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Game.

936
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Recognize game.

937
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Game.

938
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Recognize that game real quick.

939
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh.

940
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, I see.

941
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Buckle up.

942
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Holy shit.

943
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jasmine, who has negative four points this week on the Yahoo

944
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,240
Answers service.

945
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,760
Anyone write a book blurb for me?

946
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,640
Ashley Everett is a valiant.

947
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,280
A valiant is a creature, much like a ghoul, who feeds on human flesh and is physically

948
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
superior to the average human.

949
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,880
Since some of the valiant feast is on animal flesh.

950
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,720
If you feast on human flesh, you would better be physically superior to the average human.

951
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
That is going to be a hard road to home.

952
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Hey, what the fuck?

953
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Oh, sorry.

954
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Sorry.

955
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Sorry.

956
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Sorry.

957
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I thought you were a ham.

958
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,200
Since some of the valiant feast on animal flesh, also pure blood, is a valiant who has only

959
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,720
ever feasted the highest quality of human flesh, ash, which I'm assuming is short for

960
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,640
Ashley Everett, is the descendant of the pure-blood Anthea.

961
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Oh my God.

962
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,360
So the plot of the story is, Ash was abducted from her home at the age of seven and although

963
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,100
she was stronger than any human or valiant, being pure blood, they injected some serum

964
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,260
into her neck and blah, blah.

965
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,720
She was tortured and only escaped about 10 or so years later.

966
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,980
So basically this organization is trying to get her back and stuff and they decide to

967
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,160
announce war on the valiant and stuff.

968
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,760
I know it sounds terrible and I haven't described it very well, but I was wondering if someone

969
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,200
could write me a description slash blurb, 10 points to the best one.

970
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,480
Hey, you ain't got 10 points to give out.

971
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,200
You have negative four points.

972
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,960
So let's write this blurb.

973
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Let's write this book.

974
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,680
Let's write this plot.

975
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,200
I'd rather write the screenplay adaptation because this is going to be huge.

976
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,240
Would this be the first ever screenplay based on a Yahoo answer?

977
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,560
Other than 40 days or 49 days.

978
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, I'll write a sad lip for it real quick.

979
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Oh boy.

980
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
No, no, no.

981
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,720
You don't need to because this was just a big pile of garbage words.

982
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,640
I think that my favorite part of the email is that this person who created this world

983
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,600
then went on to say, I haven't described it very well.

984
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,360
You all do a better job.

985
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm so glad the reins are in your hands for your fiction property.

986
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I'm glad somebody else is describing the world.

987
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
No, it's just you.

988
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Okay.

989
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,400
You know what really helps me garner information to write a blurb for somebody?

990
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Blah blah.

991
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,440
She's a ghoul who's tortured, you know.

992
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,760
What was the blah blah covering?

993
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,600
I can't write a blurb, but I can literally agent this shit.

994
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,280
Can we change it from valiance to sex zombies?

995
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,840
Or perhaps sex mummies.

996
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
And now it's about mummies.

997
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,760
I'm taking it in a bit of a different direction.

998
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,320
A few notes for you, Jasmine.

999
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
Mummies are in right now.

1000
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Mummies are the next thing.

1001
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,880
Can you write a book about, nope, I didn't have it.

1002
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,640
Should we get somebody else up here?

1003
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
You right there.

1004
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Come on up.

1005
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,640
Yes.

1006
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,640
Round of applause.

1007
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
Hey.

1008
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
What's up?

1009
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Hey, not much.

1010
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Cool.

1011
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
Cool, cool, cool.

1012
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
What have you been up to?

1013
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
What have you been doing for the past 45 minutes?

1014
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
What have I been doing for the past 45 minutes?

1015
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
Yeah.

1016
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
I've just been chilling.

1017
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
Nice, nice, nice.

1018
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
What's your question?

1019
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
What is your name?

1020
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
What is your name?

1021
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
My name is Matt.

1022
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Matt, do you understand the rules?

1023
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
No, bummers.

1024
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
Okay, got it.

1025
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
All right.

1026
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,640
So, my question, so, my roommate got a dog a couple years back.

1027
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,640
The statute of limitations on this question is already far, far past the point where you

1028
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,640
can think about it.

1029
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Okay.

1030
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,640
So, the problem is, normally, when you get a dog, after the first year, you normally

1031
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
get them fixed, especially if they're girl dogs.

1032
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Yeah.

1033
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
He hasn't done that.

1034
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,640
And it's been, probably, she's going on four years old at this point.

1035
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,640
I've told her that we should get her fixed because she comes in, because she has her,

1036
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
like, lady periods every time.

1037
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,640
You can just say periods.

1038
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,640
She gets, yeah, she has her periods and there's all the nastiness associated with that.

1040
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,640
Am I right, ladies?

1041
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,640
And so, I keep telling him to do this and he doesn't want to because it costs money.

1042
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,640
If you're asking if you should do it yourself, the answer is no.

1043
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,640
No, I'm not going to take his dog to the vet and get it fixed.

1044
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,640
That is not what Justin meant.

1045
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,640
Justin was suggesting a budget approach.

1046
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Bottle of red.

1047
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
Bottle of white.

1048
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Get a scalpel and do it tonight.

1049
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
What are you saying?

1050
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
What the fuck?

1051
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
You know what he's talking about?

1052
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
No, no, no, listen.

1053
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,640
This is my new parody.

1054
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
I've seen it from a retired restaurant.

1055
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,640
It's all about fixing a dog at home.

1056
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Hi, I'm Weird Al Yankovic too.

1057
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Thank you for having me.

1058
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Creepy owl.

1059
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Wait, Yankovic.

1060
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Weirder Al Yankovic.

1061
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Struggle with it.

1062
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,640
There are clinics that you can take dogs to.

1063
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
I'm pretty sure they do this for free.

1064
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,640
That's a huge overstep.

1065
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
You can't just do that to somebody's dog.

1066
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
You can.

1067
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
Trust me.

1068
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,640
I make a habit of picking up people's dogs and taking them to clinics and saying,

1069
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
fix this dog.

1070
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
This dog is broken.

1071
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,640
They may be at a point right now where they're like, dog, I may want another one of you.

1072
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
You're a pretty good dog.

1073
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,640
I'm going to leave that door open.

1074
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Is it a dog or a cat?

1075
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
It's a dog.

1076
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Still a dog from the beginning of the question.

1077
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
Same dog.

1078
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Hold on.

1079
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,640
We get updates every five minutes to whether this dog has been transmogrified.

1080
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,640
Is it a peacock or still a dog?

1081
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,640
Cool.

1082
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,640
As an addendum, he wasn't getting her fixed at first because he wanted her to have puppies.

1083
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,640
But we live in an apartment, so he backed out on that.

1084
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,640
So now it's just specifically budget.

1085
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Terrific.

1086
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,640
Maybe a Kickstarter?

1087
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
What would the rewards be, Justin?

1088
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
Just one more off the streets.

1089
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,640
For $200, you can keep the leftovers.

1090
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Can you stop it?

1091
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Travis, can you?

1092
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
One, them's good eaten.

1093
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Two, gross.

1094
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
I can't believe you said that.

1095
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Can the Kickstarter be for your new invention?

1096
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
This might not go good.

1097
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Dog tampons.

1098
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,640
Dog tampons?

1099
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
I don't know.

1100
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
We could try it.

1101
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
Right now we just go with...

1102
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
We need to try it.

1103
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
We have to try it.

1104
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Right now we're going with MacGyver dog pads, which are made from old underwears.

1105
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,640
That's not my idea.

1106
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Hold on, hold on.

1107
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,640
How does the dog feel about this?

1108
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,640
Have you asked her?

1109
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
Look, it's not me doing this.

1110
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
I should hope not.

1111
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,640
No one should be doing this.

1112
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,640
If it's any indication, they tend to come off quite often.

1113
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,640
Yeah, dog, because that's not where that's supposed to go.

1114
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
This is fun.

1115
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Is it?

1116
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,640
No, the reason this is fun, this is a commentary on the human condition, the idea of momentum

1117
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
making you just...

1118
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,640
This sounds like it's way more trouble to deal with than just spending the money to

1119
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,640
get the fig.

1120
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,640
But at this point, he's already waited four years.

1121
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
And if he does it now, he's just caving.

1122
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
He's got to go the whole way now.

1123
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,640
Now he's four years in.

1124
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,640
When that dog dies, he will sigh and say, I did it.

1125
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
I did it.

1126
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
I did it.

1127
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I kept...

1128
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
She kept...

1129
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,640
It's not a boy dog.

1130
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
No, I'm talking about the roommate, not the dog.

1131
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
Well, hold on.

1132
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Is it a boy dog?

1133
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
Just to check.

1134
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Still a girl, right?

1135
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Still a dog, too, right?

1136
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
It is still a dog.

1137
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
It is still a girl.

1138
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,640
So glad we could help.

1139
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
Did we...

1140
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Also, since everybody else has been plugging shit, can I throw something out before I walk

1141
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
away?

1142
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Did you say dog tampons?

1143
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,640
You know what?

1144
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
Shit, why not?

1145
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
We'll throw dog tampons in for free.

1146
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
That's in next year's goodie bag.

1147
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
You can check it in the next fun con.

1148
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,640
A condom and a dog tampon.

1149
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Thank you, Matthew.

1150
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Round of applause.

1151
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Thank you.

1152
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Do we need to do...

1153
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,640
We have just a few minutes left.

1154
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,640
Do you want to do the last show saver?

1155
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,640
I don't have any more.

1156
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I only did three.

1157
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
Oh.

1158
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Okay.

1159
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,640
I thought you...

1160
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,640
I don't think that's true, Justin.

1161
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,640
I think you definitely have one more on there.

1162
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,640
I don't have any more.

1163
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Stop.

1164
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Travis, stop.

1165
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Travis, stop.

1166
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:46,980
I'm going to carry it around like a boxing ring, like round announcer person.

1167
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:57,120
So if you listen to the Chicago show, you'll know prior to the Chicago live show, Justin

1168
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,800
shit his pants.

1169
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,640
And then the show went so well.

1170
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,120
And he was like, let's keep it going.

1171
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,320
And Justin, the sign says, if I can read it here to the people at home, Justin pooped

1172
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
his pants.

1173
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
On the way here.

1174
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,080
It's like his new, like separating the yellow Skittles from the rest of them so he can rock.

1175
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Oh, gross.

1176
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,880
So I'm driving to Columbus to catch our flight.

1177
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
We got a baby in the car.

1178
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,840
And when you have a baby in the car, maybe with our baby and probably with a lot of babies,

1179
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,600
once they fall asleep, you just keep going because man, the baby's asleep.

1180
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,720
So you're driving.

1181
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,720
It's like speed.

1182
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
You can't stop.

1183
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
The baby's asleep.

1184
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
You can't stop the car.

1185
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,400
And as soon as the baby fell asleep, I had to use the bathroom.

1186
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,080
I knew, I knew I needed to use the bathroom, but I couldn't stop.

1187
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,440
This lasted for about an hour and we drove past the McDonald's and I looked at McDonald's

1188
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:55,400
and I remember having the state thought, I'd love to poop at that McDonald's.

1189
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,600
I would love to poop at that McDonald's.

1190
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,640
And I drive past that McDonald's and the instant, the instant I am past that McDonald's, Charlie

1191
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,760
wakes up.

1192
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,240
So now there's a screaming baby.

1193
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,560
I think I can finally do it.

1194
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,220
And I just kept driving and eventually I was going to die.

1195
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:15,240
So I pulled off onto a dirt road where I thought that I could do this in peace.

1196
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,360
I said, honey, I need baby wipes because I'm going to use the bathroom.

1197
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:26,960
And then I pull off the side of the road and I shit you not.

1198
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,260
I kid you not.

1199
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:34,200
There was a van sitting there exactly where I was going to go use the bathroom, just sitting

1200
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:40,160
there smoking like they were waiting for people to come try to use the bathroom in this exact

1201
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,160
spot.

1202
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:47,160
So I drove on down the road and there was a Wendy's eventually, or I saw a Speedway

1203
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:53,400
rather and I almost stopped there, but then, oh hubris friends, because I also needed,

1204
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,480
I was hungry too, so I saw a Wendy's up the road a little bit and then I hit a stoplight.

1205
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Oh, classic.

1206
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,240
And then I got to the door of the Wendy's and as I was going in the Wendy's thing, it

1207
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
all fell apart.

1208
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,400
And this is where it gets like Werner Herzog levels of tragedy.

1209
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,440
I didn't, they didn't have a trash can for anything.

1210
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,440
So I left, not that he was going to shit in the trash can, I left him in the corner and

1211
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
I left.

1212
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,240
Because, okay, my two options were that or have Dave Thomas's fucking ghost watching

1213
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,280
me carry dirty underwear through the restaurant.

1214
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,280
I'm not going to do that.

1215
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,760
And then just walk out to the counter and go, oh, where would you like me to put this?

1216
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,320
Do you have a special receptacle for dirty laundry?

1217
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:43,120
30 minutes later, Charlie used to eat, oh, by the way, I did order food at the drive

1218
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:50,120
through and I got a fucking jalapeno chicken sandwich with ghost pepper sauce on it.

1219
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,240
I wasn't even thinking.

1220
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,080
And then a half hour later, Charlie had to, uh, had to eat and said he wanted to stop

1221
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
and we passed the Wendy's.

1222
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
He said stop there.

1223
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
I said, I can't do that.

1224
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,080
What if they put out an all Wendy's bullets in a little bit?

1225
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,120
I can't go in Wendy's ever again.

1226
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,360
I forgot how long that story was.

1227
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
I goaded you into telling it.

1228
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Well, that's going to do it for us.

1229
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Let me give you one more question.

1230
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,360
You got another question?

1231
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Uh, how about this one?

1232
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360
It was sent in by Jadon.

1233
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,360
Yes.

1234
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Jadon is not here.

1235
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Wait, is he?

1236
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Jadon.

1237
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Jadon.

1238
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
Okay.

1239
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,640
I thought Drew knew whether Jadon was here or not.

1240
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,640
No, no.

1241
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,640
He's back of the office.

1242
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,840
It's by Yahoo answers user Liz who asks, I need to learn how to work at Subway.

1243
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,720
I just got a summer job at Subway and I start my training in three days.

1244
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,360
I really want to know something before I get there so I can pick up everything fast and

1245
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,080
get to work quicker.

1246
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,760
Stuff like how to work the register, how to bake bread, et cetera would be helpful.

1247
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
Thanks.

1248
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,320
Is this the first person ever who doesn't want to waste time working at Subway?

1249
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,760
Like I want to get straight to work.

1250
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,700
I think they want to roll up and then be like, all right, here's your, here's your mess smock

1251
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,000
and here's your name tag and I'm going to show you how to use a provolone slicer and

1252
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
they're like, don't even bother.

1253
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh my God.

1254
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You did it perfect your first time.

1255
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You are the chosen one.

1256
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,080
You are the chosen, you are, you are the, the focal ascendant.

1257
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,040
That's the bad part about that if you go in there and too good, they're going to think

1258
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,760
you're the one for prophecy and then you got to fight a dragon or something.

1259
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,400
You got to fight the salami dragon.

1260
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:33,520
That's the name of my favorite Def Leppard album, fight the salami dragon.

1261
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,720
Is there an underground, fuck, is there an underground black market Subway school that

1262
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,960
we can run to get people better at their craft?

1263
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,960
I was, I worked next to a subway at the country's best yogurt once and I would go in there basically

1264
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,320
every day and I would get that smell on me and it's still on me to this day and one time

1265
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,920
somebody was making my sandwich and then they cut their finger and then they, but they're

1266
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,640
wearing a plastic thing on their hands.

1267
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,600
So that was aesthetically just, but the worst, there's a very challenging ending to this

1268
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,640
episode of my brother, my brother and me, but then they tried to fucking one hand it

1269
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,840
like, they tried to like do it with their good clean hand and then the manager came

1270
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,280
out and was like, don't just go in the back room.

1271
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,560
I was so angry at you at this moment.

1272
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,360
I worked at Jimmy John's for a while.

1273
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Not Jermaine.

1274
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,680
No, it is because I never learned to make any sandwiches the whole time I was there

1275
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,920
because this is not a joke.

1276
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,440
They're so obsessed with being fast that they would every time be like, Travis hop on the

1277
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,400
line and make like a number 1400 sandwich or whatever and I would say, okay, no one's

1278
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
trained me to do that yet.

1279
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
And they're like, oh, there's no time for that.

1280
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,960
Just get on the register every time for six months and I'm like, okay.

1281
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,280
And then when I went to quit, the dude was like, how about instead we make you assistant

1282
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:02,000
manager and I was like, Austin, I still don't know how to make sandwiches.

1283
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah, no, you're, you, you would be more big picture.

1284
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,560
I was just there to develop him in the taste and development department.

1285
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,280
What if we take the bread away?

1286
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,640
What are we left with then?

1287
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
It's a disaster ball.

1288
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,640
It's an oops, no bread.

1289
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,520
The salami is on the outside, the bread's in the middle.

1290
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,040
How about, no, none of it has been a thing yet.

1291
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,040
Let's stop the show.

1292
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,040
We've done, we've, we're exhausted.

1293
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
Okay.

1294
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,040
And we don't have any more, we got to walk down the mountain.

1295
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Yeah.

1296
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,560
Thank you so much for having us here at a maximum fun convention.

1297
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,960
We've had a lot of fun eating a lot of good food.

1298
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,160
Thanks to everybody that Jesse mentioned earlier.

1299
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,160
Yeah.

1300
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,400
Like I know, I feel like I know most of the names, but then I'll forget one and that person

1301
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
will feel so shitty.

1302
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,360
I don't want to do that to them.

1303
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:03,800
I will say Jesse didn't thank our wives and I want to thank you to our wives and our baby.

1304
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,360
Well, it's not our baby.

1305
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Careful.

1306
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,720
Takes a village Griffin, takes a village.

1307
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,360
Real quick before we end, we just want to jump back in to say thank you once more to

1308
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360

Let go of my shoe.

1316
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,320
I was thinking like, you know how TV shows have those things at the end.

1317
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,440
It's like a fun little cartoon and it's like, what if we had one of those for the end of

1318
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,440
our show?

1319
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,440
What would that look like?

1320
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,440
Justin?

1321
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,440
What did you think about it?

1322
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
Let me have this guy.

1323
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,440

1324
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,440
Sit good dog.

1325
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,440
Nailed it.

1326
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,440
Back to the show.

1327
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Hold on.

1328
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,440
Hold on.

1329
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Hold on.

1330
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,440
Hold on.

1331
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
Can we get Chuck Lorre to write one of his really funny disclaimers?

1332
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,920
That was a Chuck Lorre release from River to you.
