1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,640
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Now, folks, I'm gonna try to keep this brief, but the reviews are in, Captain Underpants is a hit.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,200
Hey guys, hey guys, boxers or briefs is my question.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,480
Boxer office smash, is that anything?

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
It's something, it's something.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,080
Hey.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
Listen, it's a watch.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
What's going on under those pants?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
His penis never comes out, the whole movie, don't even worry about it.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
Oh, I had to Google that to make sure before I took all my kids to it.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,840
Travis, let me ask you a question.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,520
When you were making your fantasy cast list on IMDB for Captain Underpants,

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,400
who did you envision, who would be your dream get for Professor Poopypants?

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,880
Myself.

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,360
Myself, close, Nick Kroll takes on the notoriously dirty drawers as Professor Poopypants.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,080
Kevin Hart is back as George Beard, Thomas Middleditch.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,080
In a reprise role, it's the first one of the Captain Underpants movies,

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,640
but it's the second time Kevin Hart has played a Captain Underpants role in a film.

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
Justin, who plays Professor Poopypants' sidekick, Sid Mark?

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
That's Mark Paul Gosler.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,240
Weird.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,040
With a dramatic turn.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,320
Captain Underpants is about two children who hypnotize a bad man

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,600
into thinking he's a superhero who wears his underpants everywhere.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Can I say this?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
Because the problem is he didn't have a living will,

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
and I want to get out in front of this now on this podcast.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
If you're a kid, don't fucking turn me into Captain Underpants.

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,200
Don't do it.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
If I cross you.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,240
Stop it.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't do it.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
If you, but listen, if they do.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,640
This is so hard to say because nobody wants to think this way.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,440
You know, you want to think everything's going to be fine forever,

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,200
but if you see me on the street wearing a cape and my underpants

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
and I've been hypnotized by children, and please confirm,

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
I may just be at some sort of parade, but if I have been hypnotized by children,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
I need you, I need you to bring me down.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,240
All right?

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Oh, shit.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
You're saying we have legal, and this podcast counts,

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,160
like we can, we can get this episode notarized or whatever,

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,920
but you're saying if children hypnotize you, Justin,

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,880
into becoming an underwear crime fighter,

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Travis and I, in order to sort of save your, your dignity,

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,920
your, your legacy, sort of your whole brand, we can legally kill you.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Not just can legally kill me.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,680
Must.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
You do not have the legal right to kill me.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
You have the moral obligation.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
And that's, that'll hold up in court.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,200
So just to, just to clarify, we could be talking about Wonder Woman,

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,040
a movie that I am legitimately very excited to see,

63
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,880
and as soon as I figure out how to do so, while also having a seven-month-old child,

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,360
I will be doing so.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Stack them up and, to stack the two of you up in a trench coat and go in.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,440
Okay, so we could be talking about that, but instead,

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,880
we are talking about morally being obligated to euthanize our brother,

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
in the event that he's in underpants.

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,760
Travis, you've used the term euthanize as if Justin will just lay down and accept his fate.

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,480
Oh, listen, no, you're gonna have to, euthanothin', you're gonna have to kill me.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,040
And listen, I'm gonna be a superhero, okay?

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
It's gonna be tough.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
I will see Captain Underpants before I see Wonder Woman.

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,760
Confront that.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,360
A film I would like to see, and I'm confronting it here with you.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Now, I will say this.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,640
The tomatometers looking good, 86%.

78
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Really?

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a zesty ragu.

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm gonna enjoy this particular marinara.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,320
For sure, but it is not going to star America's favorite Amazon.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll be catching that on DVD.

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,080
Wonder Woman, get at me, I will check you in September.

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you for all you've done for our nation.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Justin, J-Bones, can you make me a promise?

86
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
G-money, hit it.

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,280
When you do fall into our trap after you have been hypnotized by the children

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,800
into becoming the Underwear Man, and we catch you in the trap, and we do kill you,

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,200
can you promise me that there will not be one last moment of lucidity there at the end

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,040
where you thank us before dying, and you're your regular Justin in that moment?

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
Because I'm thinking about it, Justin.

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
That's gonna be too hard for me to handle.

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,840
I've just killed my underwear superhero brother.

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
I don't need him turning back into Justin there at the end like,

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
you've set me free, you know what I mean?

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Like, if you do have that moment of lucidity, I need you to keep pretending

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,320
that you're the Underwear Man, just so I don't have to deal with those demons.

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,920
What if my voice sounds different?

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,720
You'll know what's up.

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Just do your best.

101
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm sorry, Griffin.

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to say, Justin, don't make eye contact with Griffin in that moment,

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
but do make eye contact with me because I want to know that I freed you

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,200
and you also appreciate it.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,440
I need to know that you appreciate how hard it was for me to kill you in your final moments.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Let me get another one in here.

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,200
The children have just done the spell to you, and the transformation has begun.

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,960
At what point in the transformation can Travis and I sort of go safety off, free fire?

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Is it like a Walking Dead situation where if you are bitten, you're done?

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
You're meat already, and so we should just...

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,960
Or do you think you might be able to fight off the kid's spell?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Well, I mean, it's further complicated by the fact that if they're just fucking with me,

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,640
go ahead and take the shot.

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,000
If you've got the shot, take the shot, okay?

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
Okay. If the kids are fucking with me.

116
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:01,520
If there is an evil that I have to confront and subdue, let me just do it, okay?

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,920
I'll do the evil. I'll fight the evil.

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,480
But then, the moment that the evils...

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
Take the shot, okay?

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,280
I need you to promise.

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
I promise I'll kill you in your underwear.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
I will hire Bradley Cooper to kill you in your underwear.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Yeah, he'll help out, definitely.

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,480
I would like a little Bradley Cooper buffer between me and my brother.

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
And you know what?

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,040
I think of...

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Listen, I don't know Bradley that well.

128
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
We've only chatted online a couple times,

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,920
but I'm pretty sure he's probably been asked to do this kind of thing before.

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,360
No, dude's yoked.

131
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
He could fucking kill, definitely.

132
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,920
Yeah.

133
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah.

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
Hey, great news, guys.

135
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,760
I googled Mark Paul Gosselaar.

136
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
His Twitter account is just mpg.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
Well done.

138
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
Wow, early adopter.

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
Great get in there.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Can we do advice?

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
Justin, do question number four.

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
I was going to save it.

144
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
I wasn't sure about it, but I'm feeling it.

145
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,800
Jump right into it.

146
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,880
How do you throw away empty alcohol bottles and cans and shit

147
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,680
if you're underage and don't want to get caught?

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm V drunk.

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Please tell me how to throw away my stuff.

150
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Peace, Gmail.

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,440
I think legally, we've covered ourselves so far.

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
We're allowed to legally murder Justin

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,600
if he gets hypnotized and becoming an underwear man.

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
And now legally, we also have to say,

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,760
it's not cool to do this.

156
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
Okay, now that we've said that.

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Even if we maybe act like you're cool

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,000
or say that it's cool pretty directly in the next few minutes,

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
it's that you should know how we really feel.

160
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Yeah.

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
And it's just not cool.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,680
What follows is-

163
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay.

164
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,520
What follows is-

165
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,800
It's fair use parody public domain creative comments.

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
Yeah, this is what we like to call jokes.

167
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
This is so cool.

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,520
Yeah.

169
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
Because you get it.

170
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
I like that.

171
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
I do worry.

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,280
Let me worry about this for a second.

173
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,320
If you're an underage teen and you're drinking

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
and you're very drunk

175
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,600
and then you're emailing your favorite advice podcast,

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,640
I assume, are you drinking alone?

177
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,720
Because that seems to me not great.

178
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
Not ideal, not ideal.

179
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,960
Not actually cool.

180
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
Here's my question about this.

181
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,200
At what point do you think

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
in this underage teen drinking experience

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
do you do the slow scope around

184
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,520
and realize how many empty bottles and cans there are

185
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,920
and realize you have not, you're just like,

186
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,600
oh no, you haven't planned some kind of bag scenario

187
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
to get these out of the house

188
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,400
and into your neighbor's garbage can?

189
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,360
Yeah.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
So the secret is to buy only the alcohol

191
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
that you know your dad's drinking,

192
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,200
that old timey,

193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,400
I think your dad probably drinks like old timey gut rumble

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
and it's just a dang clogger

195
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,320
and it just hurts the bones and muscles a lot to drink it.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
And so you buy that,

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
you throw it in the regular old garbage can,

198
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,360
your dad's just like must have tied a few on last night.

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,160
I don't remember it,

200
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,440
but this dark juice does stuff,

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
plays tricks on the mind, doesn't it?

202
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,760
What if you took all your empty bottles and cans

203
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
and just before somebody got home,

204
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,520
you just kind of like spread them around the dog

205
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
and then when people,

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
when whoever your guardians got home,

207
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,520
they're like, what?

208
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,080
You're like, what, Sparky?

209
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,160
And you acted horrified.

210
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,080
Now listen, this isn't gonna work,

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,520
but if you refuse to cave on this,

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,960
it's gonna be a story

213
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,360
that you and your guardians will have together forever

214
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
that when you are older and you do eventually,

215
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,760
like at 40,

216
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,520
you have a nice like single malt scotch with them

217
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,160
and they can be like,

218
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,680
hey, do you remember that time

219
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
that you tried to convince me

220
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,520
that Sparky drank all that bush light?

221
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,600
And you can be like, what are you talking about?

222
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
That's exactly what happened.

223
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
You stick to it.

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,280
You never change it because they'll catch you.

225
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,080
Dad tried to get me on this at age 30 last week.

226
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
He was like, hey, during homecoming,

227
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,200
did you go over to Michael's house

228
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
and then you all drank six Smirnoff ices

229
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,000
between the eight of you

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
and pretended to just get like really fucked up drunk

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
and then try to sneak the bottles out the next morning?

232
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
And I was like, well, I'm 30, so yeah.

233
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,920
And then cops busted in and they arrested me

234
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,080
and took, I'm recording this in jail right now.

235
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,680
I've been in jail for like a week.

236
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
I have a question for you, question asker.

237
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
Two questions, I guess.

238
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,400
Question one, get out your phone,

239
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,680
go to your list of contacts.

240
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
Is the wolf in there at all?

241
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,480
If you can have a fish, is the wolf in there?

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
Second question, do you just have Harvey Keitel's number?

243
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,080
Because he will, it was basically a documentary.

244
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,040
Oh, I see you have a little underage drinking.

245
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
That's great, I love this.

246
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,960
Let me, yeah, go ahead and just clean all these up for you.

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm your live-in maid, Harvey Keitel.

248
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,960
Do you, you got any Altoids on you?

249
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
No, I don't have, why would I have Altoids, Harvey Keitel?

250
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
You started underage drinking without any Altoids, huh?

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
And I'm the asshole.

252
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
Schnapps, you expect me to clean up schnapps?

253
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,720
What the fuck?

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
I don't have to be here.

255
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
I think a good drink for teens.

256
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,360
Oh, jeez.

257
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
Do you know how teens are crazy about the hard sodas now, right?

258
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,120
Orange hard soda.

259
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
Like the difficult sodas?

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
The hard, the challenging sodas.

261
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Chunky Dr. Pepper.

262
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,960
Like an elderberry soda, that's hard, that's difficult to parse.

263
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:59,200
So you get some Mike's Latin lemonade, the challenging, challenging teen lemonade.

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm gonna have not your father's trigonometry root beer.

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,800
The thing is about it, the bottle is made of candy.

266
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,760
Okay, it's not, oh God, again, legally, hi, editors, editorial note here.

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,040
It's super not, kids, enjoy the rest of the podcast.

268
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
No, no, no, I'm not saying it is now.

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,040
I'm saying in our new product, the bottle is made of candy.

270
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,960
Like those wax bottles that you like bite the end off of and squeeze

271
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,000
like the teaspoon of juice into your mouth?

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
That's exactly right.

273
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
It's called brew and chew and you drink the drink in it

274
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
and then you have to eat the bottles.

275
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
There's no evidence.

276
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
And here's the thing, are you ready for this?

277
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,840
Because this one's fucking good.

278
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,600
The bottles, what flavor are they?

279
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
You guessed it, spearmint.

280
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,360
So you have drunk, you have had a refreshing bottle of brew.

281
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
Then you've had a great snack to follow it up.

282
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,080
You're gonna have some regrets about halfway through that bottle

283
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
when you gotta realize you're gonna eat the whole bottle.

284
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,200
Spearmint usually doesn't come in meal form, but that's what we're talking about.

285
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,320
You're gonna have to commit.

286
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
How bad do you wanna break the rules, huh?

287
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
This is a spearmint dish that you're going to be eating.

288
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
It's gonna be a lot of spearmint.

289
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,640
You're gonna have to gummy down.

290
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Yeah, but you do that and then you're gonna have fresh breath

291
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
and then we will detect the alcohol.

292
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,960
Let me hit you with this.

293
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,080
I can't stress enough, we do not endorse underage drinking,

294
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
but that's a great idea.

295
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,560
That's fucking funny and good and cool to do.

296
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,840
I also wanna hit you with guys with this idea that I've been working on.

297
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,320
It is, we take a very, very, very hyper concentrated,

298
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
you know, Mike's hard lemonade or whatever.

299
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Very concentrated, a hyper concentrated boons farm

300
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,840
and we somehow saturate a sort of spongy fidget spinner with it.

301
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,280
And then you just sort of like and catch it, catch it, catch it.

302
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,200
And then faded because of all the, again, very, very concentrated boons farm.

303
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,840
It's going to be acidic, which is not to say that it will taste sour,

304
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,800
but that it will have many properties that one usually associates with acid.

305
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,960
But also at the end, what was that noise?

306
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,520
Are you drunk?

307
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,120
No, it's just a fidget spinner.

308
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Let me go a different direction.

309
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,200
What have you said to your kids?

310
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,080
And this might be more of a deterrent than a way to get away with it.

311
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,200
But what have you said to your kids like, hey, I don't care what age you are,

312
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,440
you're allowed to drink as much as you want,

313
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:48,720
but the only drink you're allowed to have is 50% the pettiest, smokiest scotch

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,520
and 50% absinthe, enjoy.

315
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,120
Yeah, that's a bad way to do parenting, I feel like.

316
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,760
But how long do you think that continues to be a problem

317
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,800
before it's just like, sip, nope, you know what, I'm good.

318
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm all set.

319
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,400
This is awful.

320
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,560
Well, that's what all alcohol tastes like.

321
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Bye.

322
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
Can I hit y'all with Yahoo?

323
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,400
Yeah, it's going underage drink.

324
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:12,880
Don't underage drink.

325
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
This has been a public service announcement.

326
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
Yeah, if you bookend it, then people know which part's serious and which part's not.

327
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
Kyle Horning sent this in.

328
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,200
Thank you, Kyle Horning.

329
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,560
It's Yahoo Answers User, question mark, which is weird.

330
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,600
Um, usually that means that, like, their profile didn't load or has been erased

331
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
and so it just shows a question mark.

332
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,720
They actually made their profile name question mark.

333
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,360
And they said, yeah, they said, going to arrest someone soon.

334
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
It's my friend.

335
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,280
They don't know I'm a cop.

336
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,400
What should I do?

337
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,760
I have four hours.

338
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Whoa, whoa.

339
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,760
Fucking heavy stuff.

340
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,320
This is what I imagine The Wire is like, but I've never watched it.

341
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
I've only seen one season of The Wire, but this started the second season and I was like,

342
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,320
who the fuck are all these new peop- it's all boats this season?

343
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,880
No, but maybe this is what happens.

344
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,760
My best friend Justin and Travis, they don't know I'm a cop, but in four hours,

345
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,440
they will know when I have them down up against the car or on the ground

346
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,840
with those big nasty silver bracelets going over their wrists.

347
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
Griffin, do you think when you have to do that,

348
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
when you have to arrest, say, Justin Minsker, a friend of yours,

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,800
would you cry while you were doing it?

350
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,760
Or do you think that, like, you would finally feel a weight lifted off of your shoulders?

351
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,880
Do I cry every time I record a podcast or a goof-ass video game video?

352
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,040
No, because it's my fucking job, dog.

353
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh, you cry sometimes, though.

354
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
I mean, only when the internet says mean things about me,

355
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
but not usually, like, just it's my job.

356
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
If I arrest Justin Minsker, that's a job.

357
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,320
It's a J-O-B.

358
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,120
Sorry, dude.

359
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
Click, click.

360
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
I gotta collect in a paycheck.

361
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,600
Griffin, what do you think you said?

362
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,800
Is it, like, a boo-yah moment or is it, like, I can't believe you made me do this moment?

363
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,040
Like, this is on you, not on me.

364
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,240
If you weren't a criminal, I wouldn't have to cop all over you.

365
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,720
I think I'd just robo-cop up and just, like, Miranda that shit and don't even-

366
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
Do you have the right to remain my friend?

367
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,600
Yeah, like, I'd be like, you have the right to remain silent, but, like, barbecue Tuesday?

368
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Does that sound good?

369
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,120
Weather looks nice.

370
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,160
We still down?

371
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,720
We still down?

372
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
We're gonna play some Coup in the backyard?

373
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
I will get your mower back to you, by the way.

374
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,040
I'll get your mower back to, well, to your next of kin,

375
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,600
because you're going to the fucking pokey, dude.

376
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,920
All right, let's go.

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,120
I love you.

378
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,680
Come on.

379
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,160
I love you.

380
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Say goodbye.

381
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
How often do you say you love you to, like, a friend that you're arresting?

382
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Yeah, you can slip it into the old Miranda and it still counts.

383
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,160
I have to arrest someone soon, but they don't know I'm a cop.

384
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Is this an undercover situa-

385
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,600
It doesn't-

386
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
What's tricky is it doesn't sound like an undercover situation.

387
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
No, it just sounds like you don't know them that well.

388
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,960
Or they don't know you, because they don't know your vocation.

389
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,120
You know, I bet the hardest part of that scenario is when you're like,

390
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,240
I'm a cop, and they kind of laugh, and you're like, no, really?

391
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
And they're like, that's a good one.

392
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
And you're like, no, no, really?

393
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
I really am a cop.

394
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,920
Like, it's probably hard to get over that hump, you know, of like,

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,680
I'm really arresting you.

396
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
Very funny, Steve.

397
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
Take these cuffs off.

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,040
No, no, I really am a cop.

399
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,560
Do you think, yeah, it's the fact that he's a cop for friends in case

400
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,920
they all want to get a little bit nasty?

401
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
He doesn't need, like, the-

402
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,680
Yeah, that's-

403
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,640
The judgment.

404
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
You're a cop.

405
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
How could you steal that?

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,240
Yeah.

407
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,640
Wait, you underaged drunk when you were 17, and he starts kind of twitching?

408
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,760
And you're like, what's up, Steve?

409
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,520
Like, no, nothing.

410
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,800
Well, it's like we're going out on a pontoon boat, and I'm not driving the boat,

411
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,720
but am I allowed to drink on the water?

412
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,680
It is in public.

413
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,120
Ah, but Griffin's here.

414
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
Maybe I shouldn't.

415
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Just to be safe.

416
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,400
Is there another-

417
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,320
Let me hit this.

418
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,400
Legally, this is a joke.

419
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,360
Got four hours.

420
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm gonna phone my buddy up and just say, like, pack a bag, get gone.

421
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,440
I will hunt you for the rest of the night.

422
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Don't get me wrong.

423
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,800
We have got a Jovert-Valjean situation.

424
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,880
This is absolutely what is up.

425
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,160
You've been selling stolen iPod Nanos online.

426
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,360
And I know it's you, dog.

427
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
You don't know it's me on the other end of the badge.

428
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
You made your username Nano Steve Jenkins.

429
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
I know it's you.

430
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
I know it's you, Steve Jenkins.

431
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
I know it was you the whole time.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
But anyway, you have four hours.

433
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,840
And then I will come for you.

434
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Forever.

435
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
Forever, I will be a specter of death on your doorstep, Steve.

436
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,080
Why'd you have to sell those Nanos?

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Every moment of every day for the rest of your life,

438
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,880
you will feel my hot breath on the back of your neck.

439
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,920
Now get out of town.

440
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
I love you, you beautiful bastard.

441
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,600
I love you.

442
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,100
Go.

443
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,600
I love you.

444
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,160
Fly, my beautiful butterfly.

445
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,080
But can I count on you and Steven to be there at the barbecue on Thursday?

446
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,880
And you're still going to walk my dog while I'm in Baltimore, right?

447
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,840
Right?

448
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,200
We're still good on that front.

449
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Excellent.

450
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,240
Me and my buddies are heading out on the east side in three hours.

451
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,320
I want a carpool.

452
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,200
So that's the decision.

453
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Like you can get the extra heads up and like bounce.

454
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,440
But like we're going to Barbarellas.

455
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,640
It's going to be fucking fine.

456
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,120
You're not?

457
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,520
Okay.

458
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,480
No, I understand.

459
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,680
I'll hunt you like the devil.

460
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,180
Bye.

461
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,080
I love you.

462
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,240
Please, if you could leave some clues, that would be great.

463
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,880
Just make it easier on me.

464
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,040
Leave a few clues just to make it fun.

465
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,840
Like you can't come play Coup at my cookout next weekend,

466
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,520
but we could play a different kind of game.

467
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,400
A hunting game.

468
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,080
You fucking Nano pervert.

469
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,120
You Nano freak.

470
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,200
Of all the jobs that it would be hard to find out your friend does,

471
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,880
I think like them banging on your door and arresting you.

472
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
That's really rough.

473
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,960
But I think a rougher one would be if you found out your friend was jigsaw.

474
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,240
Because that would be very unfortunate to wake up and you're like,

475
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,320
your butt has been manacled to someone else's butt.

476
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,120
He's like, tear your own butts off if you want to live.

477
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,720
And also, Greg, it's so nice to see you.

478
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,680
Justin, just to clarify, you think the profession of cop is definitely hard,

479
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,280
but much more difficult is the profession of serial killer.

480
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm saying it's hard to find out that your friend has been jigsawed the whole time.

481
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm saying that that would be very shocking.

482
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,360
And that is an unfair association, Travis.

483
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,680
Jigsaw is not just a serial killer.

484
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,080
He also, like, it takes a lot of work to make all those bone mazes and stuff.

485
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,000
Like, it's a lot of work.

486
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,360
But this is, okay, you know what's hard?

487
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,480
Finding out your friend's a cop.

488
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,360
You know what's harder?

489
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,480
Finding out that your friend is you from an alternate dimension but evil

490
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,040
and send them to kill you.

491
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, shit.

492
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,520
Travis, that would definitely be hard.

493
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,920
That would be really difficult.

494
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Find out that your friend is a robot sent from the future whose only job

495
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,880
is to erase your existence before you, like, solve world peace.

496
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
I hate that.

497
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,920
Right, we've all been there.

498
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Who can I trust anymore?

499
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,240
Pick up the bandsaw you find at your fi-

500
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,200
I bought you this.

501
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
I bought you this bandsaw.

502
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,600
I bought you this for your birthday.

503
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,880
Wait, no, this is my fucking bandsaw.

504
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,240
I let you borrow it.

505
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
Hey, yeah, wait a minute.

506
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
This is what?

507
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
You can have it back afterwards.

508
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,440
You'll have to find the key.

509
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,120
You gave me your spare keys.

510
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,760
Oh.

511
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh, shit, that's right.

512
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,680
Oh, yeah.

513
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,200
Anyway, fill up this bucket with your own butt meat.

514
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
No, and it'll raise the portcullis.

515
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,320
I don't want to raise the portcullis.

516
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,920
Is this your den?

517
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,720
It is.

518
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,360
It is my den.

519
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,320
I love what you've done.

520
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,200
Am I still going to see you for barbecue on Thursday?

521
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, fine.

522
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,320
Yes.

523
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,840
We said we'd come.

524
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,880
We said we'd be there.

525
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
Guess what we're ha-

526
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
I don't want to guess what we're having.

527
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,200
Pork butt.

528
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,880
I'll stick to potato salad and prepackaged Kroger cookies.

529
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,440
Thank you.

530
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,200
Guess what we're going to be having.

531
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,040
Are you going to grill and cook my butt meat that I put in the bucket to counterweight

532
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
the portcullis?

533
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,560
No, we got kosher franks.

534
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,520
Don't be a dick.

535
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Don't be a dick about this.

536
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,880
I can't believe I have to explain this to you.

537
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,120
The butt meat portcullis maze trap.

538
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,640
It's supposed to teach you about the value of your life and stuff.

539
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,600
I love you.

540
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,320
I love you.

541
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,800
You've just seemed really down lately and I want to make you appreciate the things that

542
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,560
you have and the butt that you're left with.

543
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,600
So can I go or are you two gonna-

544
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,800
Hey, do you mind?

545
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
We're working some shit out.

546
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,600
Okay, I filled up the bucket with my butt meat to open the portcullis.

547
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,400
Can I go?

548
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,280
One moment.

549
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,960
You're also under arrest.

550
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,280
That's right.

551
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,480
Officer Jigsaw.

552
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Reporting for duty.

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm also a doctor and a lawyer.

554
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I have a lot of free time.

555
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,840
Get in my patty wagon.

556
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,680
Can I stand up in the patty wagon?

557
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,800
Do I have to sit down?

558
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
Because I have a situation back here now.

559
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,800
I love you a lot.

560
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,120
I know.

561
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,920
We're good friends.

562
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,800
I love you so much.

563
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,920
We're really good friends.

564
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,600
You introduced me to my wife.

565
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,080
I did.

566
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,720
That's right.

567
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,120
Greg, sit up front.

568
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,600
Come on.

569
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,960
You don't need to ride the back patty wagon with that other wiener.

570
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,480
But putting the music-

571
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,760
Put a towel down.

572
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
We'll listen to the new Adele album.

573
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,320
I bought you that new-

574
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,200
Thank you.

575
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,880
You really know my tastes.

576
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,080
It was a gift for my adult bar mitzvah.

577
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm the most interesting character the McElroy brothers have ever conceived.

578
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,000
They've been sitting on me for a while which is ironic

579
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
because you won't be sitting on anything.

580
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,560
It's gonna be hard not to do that voice for a while.

581
00:25:59,560 --> 00:25:59,960
I know.

582
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,120
Hold on.

583
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
I left the radio on.

584
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,800
Let me-

585
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,520
Oh, I'm turning the radio up.

586
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,160
I'm turning it up.

587
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm turning it up.

588
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
I want a munch!

589
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,320
Squad!

590
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,880
Squad!

591
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I want two munch!

592
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,840
Squad!

593
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,480
Squad!

594
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Are you guys munch squads have gotten-

595
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,840
Your squads have gotten a little bit tepid, okay?

596
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,480
Okay, I don't-

597
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,800
Really?

598
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,080
I was actually just thinking how enthusiastic mine was comparatively.

599
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah, I kind of tried to put a little bit more stink in it

600
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,200
because like 10 minutes ago I definitely heard my baby wake up from a nap

601
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,240
and I had the thought if munch squad rolls around I'll really be able to hit it.

602
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,760
Okay, so listen.

603
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
Arby's is done.

604
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,560
Oh, shit.

605
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,280
Okay, well-

606
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,520
Usually when we feature people on the munch squad

607
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,560
it's because they're so enthusiastic about the worst things they could do to people.

608
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,480
Arby's brought back the smoke house pork belly sandwich to its restaurant.

609
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,960
I remember.

610
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,720
It's uh...

611
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,880
If you remember last year Arby's went with no national restaurant chain

612
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,600
gone before by offering pork belly also known as the bigger better bacon.

613
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,440
Also known as an artisanal meat that I don't really trust you with in your hands.

614
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,400
But that's also like saying steak it's hamburger too the sequel for better.

615
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,200
But there's a quote here from Rob Lynch chief marketing officer

616
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,000
and brand president of Arby's restaurant group.

617
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,760
And this man sounds broken.

618
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,880
The Arby's system has chewed him up and spit him out.

619
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Let's see what he's got to say about this sandwich.

620
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
Our guests love pork belly.

621
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,600
Said Rob Lynch chief marketing officer.

622
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,960
Hey yo this sounds like my friend Detective Jigsaw.

623
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,440
And brand president it's not uh whatever.

624
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
More sigh Justin.

625
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,840
When we launched it last year we weren't sure how well it would do

626
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,920
because no one in our industry had done a slow smoked pork belly sandwich before.

627
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,760
But the response was it was remarkable.

628
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,760
Significantly exceeding our wildest expectations.

629
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,040
So we worked hard to bring it back as soon as possible and here it is.

630
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,000
Pork belly is just another example of our unique approach to food.

631
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,000
Which is to offer innovation that our guests can only find at Arby's.

632
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,040
And then the last sentence of this quote is this.

633
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,840
We are really proud of this meat.

634
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,360
We are really proud of this meat?

635
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,840
We are really proud of this meat.

636
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,400
So this sentence could I could I could interpret this so many ways.

637
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,200
I've never seen somebody eat a bite of food and been proud of the food for

638
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,440
maybe its courage or just its extreme quality.

639
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,560
Are you proud of what the meat has done for your company?

640
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,680
Is it are you proud of how you've prepared the meat?

641
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,400
Maybe you should have said that instead.

642
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,680
Well, considering you just said they had to work how far it's come because it was not originally pork belly,

643
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
but it worked really hard to become it.

644
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,640
Now it's pork.

645
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,600
He just said they had to work hard to bring it back.

646
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,840
So I maybe he's just proud of the effort that went into,

647
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,360
I don't know, finding someone with the in a moral gray area willing to sell Arby's pork belly.

648
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,000
Or maybe, Justin, maybe it's not that dark.

649
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,040
Maybe it's just like the first time the pork belly sandwich rolled around.

650
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,280
They sold so much of it that there was no more pork belly.

651
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,120
They had to like like travel to the bottom of the ocean and find like aqua pigs or something that they could get pork belly from.

652
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,080
And they're just proud of the exploration that they've achieved in mapping like the Mariana Trench

653
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,680
to be able to find the mer pigs to get the aquatic bellies from.

654
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,280
So the new commercials are like Arby's.

656
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,040
We have manatees.

657
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,320
And you're going to you're going to it's going to drive you fucking crazy.

658
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,320
You're going to lose.

659
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,880
Each sandwich is forty eight dollars.

660
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,560
They also brought back the the smoke mountain sandwich, which like.

661
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,600
It's a literal mount.

662
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,960
It's just eat it.

663
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,680
Just eat it.

664
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,520
It's what we've learned is the bigger it is, the happier our customers are.

665
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,800
So we literally did some some explosive blast cap mountaintop removal

666
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,520
and we put it between two big dumb slices of bread.

667
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,560
Just go for it.

668
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,600
We're done.

669
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm done.

670
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,520
I'm Arby's and I'm done.

671
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,800
There is a real smoke mountain, by the way.

672
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
It's in North Carolina.

673
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,720
Not anymore.

674
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,560
This is in the Arby's sandwiches now.

675
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,240
Big chunks of it like like we had to cut the top off a smoke mountain.

676
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,080
It's like the fuck.

677
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,800
It's just two pieces of bread and in between it is the trophy you get when you win on guts.

678
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,320
That's lathered in some sort of horseradish cream.

679
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,600
Let's let's let's take a break for a second and head on over to a little apartment.

680
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I like to think of as the money zone.

681
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
Hey, everybody.

682
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,640
First up this week.

683
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,760
Hey, guys.

684
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Hey, buddy.

685
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,960
Hey, hey, guys.

686
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,440
Welcome to my-

687
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,680
Hey, what's good fam?

688
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,320
It's me.

689
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,520
It's your boy, Justin Mackerel.

690
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,840
I'm here to tell you about our sponsor, Blue Apron.

691
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm reviewing the 10 stinkiest fidget spinners.

692
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,080
How did they get like this?

693
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,480
Hey, guys.

694
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,600
Hey, Tangleheads.

695
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,720
It's me, Travis.

696
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm going to I'm going to be making a blue apron.

697
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
There's going to be I'm going to be chewing some gum.

698
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,280
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

699
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,000
Did you two make those fucking barbecue chicken wings, though?

700
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,120
Did you all get those barbecue chicken wings from Blue Apron yet?

701
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,320
No, but just last night I made a honey rhubarb chicken.

702
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,120
Oh, I got that one.

703
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,240
I haven't made it yet.

704
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,720
Oh, it's real good.

705
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,200
I only eat chili.

706
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,560
Oh, that's right.

707
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
Yeah, well, I'm on a restricted diet.

708
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Wait, wait, on your on your cheat days, you don't just have like eight blue aprons that

709
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
you've saved up.

710
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,560
So Justin's on that fucking Hank Hill cleanse or it's just chili and sweet tea and propane.

711
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,160
For less than propane accessories for less than ten dollars per person for a meal.

712
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,000
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with

713
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,840
pre-proportioned ingredients to make delicious home cooked meals.

714
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,240
You want spicy zucchini enchiladas with creamy lime and tomato rice.

715
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,360
You can have it.

716
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,960
Elote style vegetable tostadas with summer squash, poblano peppers and cilantro rice.

717
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,760
It's there for you.

718
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,240
What's up on the menu this week?

719
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Well, you could check it out and get your first three meals for free with free shipping

720
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,120
by going to BlueApron.com slash my brother.

721
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,200
These are fresh, high quality ingredients.

722
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,360
And also you can customize what meals you get sent to you, which has been really helpful

723
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,200
for us because our baby has a food allergy.

724
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,480
So like Rachel has to eat like very specific stuff and because we can kind of tailor the

725
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,440
menu to what we want, like we can we can avoid that stuff.

726
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,280
And it's been really very, very helpful.

727
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,840
And they have a check box for like the whole thing made out of beans.

728
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,280
Please make the whole thing out of beans.

729
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,600
I love beans.

730
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,800
I haven't seen that one.

731
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
The box says beans ahoy.

732
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,160
Whenever the delivery person drops off the box, Justin, I guess you can just say, wait,

733
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,160
hold up and then cut the box open, grab the beans out from inside and then give the rest

734
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,080
back and just say return to sender.

735
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
Not a bad idea.

736
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,800
I also love they let you just very, very, very easily skip weeks.

737
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,800
So like if you're going to be out of town or if you weren't able to get to the last

738
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,480
box for whatever reason and you still have like a meal sitting in your fridge, you just

739
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,520
go on, say that you don't need it the next week and you just skip that week.

740
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,080
That's it.

741
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,480
That's enough.

742
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,280
Clearly, we want to kiss and marry Blue Apron.

743
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,840
That's it.

744
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,320
Go to BlueApron.com slash my brother and you can get your first three meals for free with

745
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,360
free shipping one last time.

746
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
BlueApron.com slash my brother.

747
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,160
I would like to tell you all about a service that's very near and dear to my heart and

748
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
that is Lyft.

749
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,680
And I think we've talked about Lyft before and I know that it's a super popular ride

750
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,480
sharing service, but I love Lyft very much.

751
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,960
We used it a ton when we were out in L.A.

752
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,640
We use it here in Cincinnati.

753
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,360
We use it whenever we travel, if, you know, there's lots of circumstances where you know

754
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,640
you're not going to need like a rental car or something, but you need to get from place

755
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,120
to place.

756
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,880
And if Lyft's in that area, it's so incredibly useful and wonderful.

757
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,240
And it's also really great for the drivers.

758
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,160
You can tip the driver if you have a really great experience.

759
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,360
And when they drive, they keep 100% of the tips.

760
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,480
So it's great for the drivers.

761
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,600
It's great for the riders.

762
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,280
And you get to rate your driver and they rate you so that you kind of filter out the crappy

763
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,760
people.

764
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,200
So it's a really wonderful experience for everyone.

765
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,360
I'm a big fan.

766
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm a big fan, if you haven't checked it out, you definitely should.

767
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,760
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better and not shitty.

768
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,680
Go to Lyft, that's lyft.com slash brother today, and you can get a $500 new driver bonus

769
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,280
if you start driving with them.

770
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,520
So go to lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms apply.

771
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Go start driving for Lyft today.

772
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,200
Hopefully, you don't have any kind of bad driving record like I did.

773
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,160
But by bad driving record, do you mean current, present, in the car?

774
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,840
No, I am a good driver now.

775
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,880
I rear-ended someone on a wet, rainy street, Griffin.

776
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,240
Just fucking drop it.

777
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
It was years ago.

778
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,320
Just stunting.

779
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,000
It was years ago.

780
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,120
Lyft's back in Austin.

781
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,920
Squash that beef.

782
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,200
Welcome back.

783
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
Oh, that's nice.

784
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,120
Baby, come back.

785
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,680
I sang it.

786
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
They couldn't resist.

787
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,400
I have a personal Jumbotron message here, and it's for Booker.

788
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,320
It's from Jeff, who says, happy birthday and happy anniversary to my fun-looking, fun-having

789
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,280
dirty boy.

790
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,320
Now that our lives have been completely, what?

791
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,040
I just like that sentence.

792
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,960
It's a very good Monster Factory goof.

793
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,800
Now that our lives have been completely taken over by the McElroy media conglomerate, I

794
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,200
can't think of any better way to celebrate than by having our favorite boys proclaim

795
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,880
our gay love for each other.

796
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,680
You are my frowny prince, and I love you forever.

797
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,240
OK, hold on.

798
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,960
Let's do this right.

799
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I hereby, henceforth, on June the 4th, 2017, the year of our Lord AD, by the power vested

800
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,240
in me, hereby proclaim your gay love.

801
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,760
So it is, and so it shall be.

802
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,760
Amen.

803
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,240
Amen.

804
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,740
Amen.

805
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,260
Man, you mentioned a factory of some sort?

806
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,760
Hmm?

807
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,820
You said something about a factory?

808
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,180
It's a fun media fucking cross-media project that your other brothers make that I thought

809
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,620
you'd be excited about.

810
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,740
What do you do on this?

811
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,260
What do you do on this media thing?

812
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,060
I'm not doing this.

813
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,780
I'm not doing this.

814
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,780
Is it like funny, or?

815
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,180
I got a message for Paul from Sunny.

816
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,580
I guess not that funny, if it didn't attract your-

817
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,940
This is the first time I'm hearing about it.

818
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,540
No one's ever brought this up to me before.

819
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,820
Sunny, I'm sorry, Paul and Sunny, they're stepping on your moment.

820
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,780
Hey, sweetie.

821
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,580
I'm just trying to learn about some kind of creative endeavor that my brothers might

822
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,940
embark on without me.

823
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,260
Okay, we've been doing it for like five years, but all right.

824
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,660
Hey, sweetie.

825
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,340
And how many times have you invited me to do it?

826
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,060
I mean, like, we've invited you like ten times.

827
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,340
Just check your texts, so.

828
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,020
Well, I'm just, I'm really busy.

829
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,500
I do a lot of podcasts, so like-

830
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I don't remember getting invited to be on Schmaners.

831
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,620
That was weird.

832
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,500
Hey, sweetie!

833
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,420
If you check your texts, I think there's like ten in there.

834
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
I'm like, what do you know about museums?

835
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,940
That's our latest episode, if anyone wants to check it out.

836
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,740
We talked about museums.

837
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,780
It was really great.

838
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,020
All right.

839
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,500
Okay, so, hey, sweetie.

840
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,620
Who's this from, M2?

841
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,380
Yeah, I've already said that, but it's from Sunny to Paul.

842
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,860
Hi, Paul.

843
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,500
Hi, Sunny.

844
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,140
Welcome to the show.

845
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,780
Hi!

846
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,980
Come have a seat.

847
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,540
Come on in.

848
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,300
So irritated.

849
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,020
Hey, sweetie.

850
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,020
I love sharing my life with you.

851
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,940
Ever since that doped up drive to get my dental implant.

852
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,820
That seems unwise.

853
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,780
Wait, you were doped up on your way there?

854
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,540
I gotta get fucking baked if I'm going to get my teeth done.

855
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,700
No way I'll do this straight.

856
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,580
Ever since that doped up drive to get my dental implant,

857
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,900
that has meant sharing the macaroons with you.

858
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,220
Happy Father's Day, birthday, or anniversary.

859
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,300
Sorry this isn't the adventure zone,

860
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,220
but keep at least one eye open,

861
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,620
because the boys just might pop in to wish you luck.

862
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,140
Nope.

863
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:32,860
No.

864
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,660
Oh, are you looking for characters?

865
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,660
We don't do character voices on that show.

866
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,780
Why would we do them here?

867
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,100
No, I think they were saying like,

868
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,420
like watch out because we're there.

869
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,300
I mean, that's a fun way.

870
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,820
That's a fun way to consume the show.

871
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,540
Just like constantly be waiting for one of us to just be like,

872
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,380
uh, and then the, you know,

873
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,460
the ogre smashes the magic mushroom forest.

874
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,580
What's up, Paul?

875
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,300
And then roll 10 dice to determine your,

876
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,660
um, happy, happy Father's Day.

877
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,860
Oh shit, that's coming up, huh?

878
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,460
Oh man, I'm going to have that.

879
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,020
Yeah!

880
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,140
Fuck yeah!

881
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,740
I'm getting myself a chop saw.

882
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,500
Yeah, dude.

883
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,860
I got a new fucking holiday.

884
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,980
Are you kidding me?

885
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,180
This would be like, Griffin, guess what?

886
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,860
You got another birthday.

887
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,820
What's up?

888
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,180
It's like in the middle of June.

889
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,900
Fuck yes.

890
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,580
The cool thing is now you don't have to do anything for dad anymore.

891
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,700
That's my favorite part.

892
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,260
Are you kidding me?

893
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,760
Yeah!

894
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,420
Take that old man.

895
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,620
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do?

896
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,260
Send him another like fucking coupon

897
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,660
for some online pepper jelly shop?

898
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,740
Fuck yeah, dude.

899
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,780
Are you kidding me?

900
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,100
This is sick.

901
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,860
Sim another picture of a Turfist Tumblr

902
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,980
and be like, it's on the way.

903
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,340
Sorry, I forgot.

904
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,620
Installment plan.

905
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,500
It's coming in.

906
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,300
Fuck yeah, dude.

907
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,340
Are you kidding me?

908
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,540
New holiday.

909
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes.

910
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,540
God yeah.

911
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,380
Finally a day when it's all about me.

912
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,020
Podcast.

913
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,820
Podcast.

914
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,460
Podcast.

915
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,700
They're audio programs that tell smart stories

916
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,820
in innovative ways

917
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,420
using editing techniques like this.

918
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,060
Like this.

919
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,620
Like this?

920
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,820
Like this?

921
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,100
But let's face it,

922
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,740
all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

923
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,300
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

924
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,580
It's so stupid.

925
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
It's just two stupid dinguses

926
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,740
being dumb idiot jerks for 90 minutes.

927
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,220
Stop podcasting yourself.

928
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,020
The stupid show that smart people love.

929
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,980
Find it on iTunes

930
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,820
or maximumfun.org.

931
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,740
My sister can't tell the difference

932
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,500
between Dennis Quaid and Tim Allen.

933
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,940
Do I tell her or should I cut my losses

934
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,020
and find a new sister?

935
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,260
That's from Nicole from San Diego.

936
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,180
How does this come up?

937
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,260
Hey, do you remember that movie

938
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,020
Santa Claus with Dennis Quaid?

939
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,740
No.

940
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,220
What?

941
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,980
Are you sure?

942
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,260
Are you sure Dennis Quaid?

943
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,540
Look at these two pictures.

944
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,660
One of them is Tim Allen.

945
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,620
One is Dennis Quaid.

946
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,100
Which one?

947
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,740
Do you remember in Independence Day

948
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,420
when Jim Allen drove the plane

949
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,860
up into the mothership?

950
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,500
Sorry, hold on.

951
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,140
Wait.

952
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,620
It's so deep that you think Tim Allen

953
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,540
has a brother named Jim Allen

954
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
who is in Independence Day.

955
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,420
Do you think Dennis Quaid ever thinks

956
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,180
about the fact that he didn't get to be

957
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,060
in Independence Day

958
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
and he gets just like really mad about it?

959
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,740
Do you think that if Randy Quaid hadn't

960
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,860
been in Independence Day

961
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,620
that like Dennis Quaid would have been

962
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,940
but you can only have one Quaid at a time?

963
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,140
Well, the character

964
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,500
and I don't want to speak ill of

965
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,540
any Quaids, any and all Quaids

966
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,780
but that character was a Randy Quaid character.

967
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,820
I think we can all agree on that.

968
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,420
It wouldn't have been the same Quaid

969
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
but it's like a one Quaid in, one Quaid out

970
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,940
kind of scenario where like

971
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,380
because Randy Quaid was in it

972
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,140
Dennis Quaid couldn't play like

973
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,220
Jeff Goldblum's dad.

974
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,580
It would have been like

975
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,540
he could have played that character

976
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,500
but all of a sudden the character

977
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,860
would be like really cool

978
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,060
and everybody just believes him

979
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,500
about the alien stuff.

980
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,020
And he can pitch really fast.

981
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,180
He can pitch super fast.

982
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,100
It's actually really weird to me.

983
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,100
A lot of brothers like the Afflecks

984
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,340
and so on you can't say this about.

985
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,100
Well, I don't think there's a Dennis Quaid role

986
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,380
that you could slide Randy into.

987
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,820
Yeah, right.

988
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,580
I don't think that that works.

989
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,980
I don't think they're interchangeable whatsoever.

990
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,100
No, it's actually

991
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,020
if you're looking at the scope, Justin

992
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,180
the Estevez brothers, right?

993
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,260
They're over here.

994
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,940
That's the most replay

995
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,700
because they no joke.

996
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,300
I've seen a lot of movies

997
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,900
that I've said like, oh, that's Martin Sheen.

998
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,020
No, no, no.

999
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,300
That's his brother

1000
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,380
who looks like his doppelganger.

1001
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,500
And then you have Randy Quaid

1002
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,180
and Dennis Quaid on the other end

1003
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,220
who you have to convince me are related.

1004
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,100
Dennis Quaid.

1005
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm trying to think of a mnemonic device

1006
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,300
so maybe we can be helpful here for once.

1007
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,620
Like leaves of three, let it be.

1008
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Leaves of Quaid.

1009
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,100
You know what I mean?

1010
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,780
Something that there's a like a funny

1011
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,980
like if I could think of something

1012
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,740
that would be like a joke, a funny joke.

1013
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,420
If it's Dennis, let it finish acting.

1014
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,340
If it's Randy, it's not Dan.

1015
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,300
Okay, no, we're not speaking about Randy Quaid.

1016
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,420
We're speaking about Timothy Allen.

1017
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,860
Oh, I see.

1018
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,420
I see.

1019
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,700
That was the original pitch.

1020
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,100
If there's growling, that's Tim Allen.

1021
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,660
Okay.

1022
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,180
He has to do it in every movie.

1023
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,580
And then I mean that by that point

1024
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,940
it's just process of elimination.

1025
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,620
You only have to remember one of them.

1026
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,340
If it's growling, it's Tim Allen, dot, dot, dot.

1027
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,940
We've sort of created sort of an if-then operation here.

1028
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,260
If Tim Allen go to line 10.

1029
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,180
If growling go to line 10, print, it's Tim Allen.

1030
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,460
Otherwise, it sounds like you got yourself

1031
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,220
one of the Quaid brothers on your hands.

1032
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,060
Sydney used to have a thing where she just biologically

1033
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,580
could not tell the difference between Bob Hoskins

1034
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,860
and Danny DeVito.

1035
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,060
That's completely unimaginable.

1036
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,180
It's easier to remember now, of course.

1037
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,060
But over the years, she had a lot of trouble

1038
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,260
distinguishing Danny DeVito and Bob Hoskins.

1039
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,740
And then it got to a point where I felt like

1040
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,100
she was probably trolling me.

1041
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
Like when she couldn't separate Bon Jovi

1042
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,660
and Bruce Springsteen for a long time,

1043
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,620
which I think is an elaborate joke.

1044
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,220
That was a joke that was played on you.

1045
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,700
Can I hit you with a good Yahoo?

1046
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,340
I have so many.

1047
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,540
Thank you to everybody who sent them in.

1048
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,180
Yes, but know that while you do,

1049
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,540
there is a pair of actors that I can't tell the difference

1050
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,180
between whose names I also can't remember right this second.

1051
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,700
So I'll be looking that up.

1052
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,260
Awesome.

1053
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,140
Can't wait.

1054
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,620
Can't wait.

1055
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,620
This one was sent in by Kevin Budnick.

1056
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,100
Thank you, Kevin.

1057
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,180
Kevin did our, I don't know if you have seen them,

1058
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,020
but the live show posters that we had in Austin.

1059
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,540
We still have a fuck ton of.

1060
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,940
We need to figure out like what to do with this.

1061
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,380
I don't know what to do with a bunch of posters.

1062
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,020
People bought them.

1063
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,980
They just gave us too many.

1064
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,140
They gave us double the amount that we bought,

1065
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,980
which is like a bank error in our favor.

1066
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,940
That was pretty tight.

1067
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,140
It's Christopher Maloney and Elias Kodius.

1068
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,300
That's legit, Trav.

1069
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,340
That's legit.

1070
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,660
Yeah, Christopher Maloney is on Law and Order

1071
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,020
and Elias Kodius played Casey Jones

1072
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,220
in the Ninja Turtles movie.

1073
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,500
They could be brothers.

1074
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,980
Oh yeah.

1075
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,300
All right.

1076
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,700
I see it.

1077
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,180
Okay.

1078
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,540
So anyway, this question from Kevin.

1079
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,340
Thank you, Kevin.

1080
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,660
It's by Yahoo Answers user John asks,

1081
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,980
are there specific names for colors we cannot see?

1082
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,940
For example, we call light with a wavelength

1083
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,980
of about 650 nanometers, I suppose, red and et cetera.

1084
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,460
If the wavelengths are beyond the visible spectrum,

1085
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,980
are there specific names for the colors?

1086
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:51,100
And I'm not looking for infrared, x-ray, gamma, microwave, et cetera.

1087
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,220
If either of you try to drop some fucking Mr. Wizard bullshit

1088
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,980
on us right now to prove how smart you are,

1089
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,620
I'll leave the call.

1090
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,060
But is there names for reds like on the end of the spectrum?

1091
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,300
And then there's probably some rays and ultra violets

1092
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,100
and all that stuff.

1093
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,260
I just think about this all the time.

1094
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,420
What if I turn the corner and there was just a new frigging color?

1095
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,860
Griffin, here's the problem.

1096
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,420
Can I tell you?

1097
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,220
I don't know much about scientists,

1098
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,340
but they probably just call it like super red or like ultra green.

1099
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,780
Very red.

1100
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,180
Yeah.

1101
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:27,580
Right?

1102
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,020
Like, come on, scientists.

1103
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,900
This is not a...

1104
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,260
Okay.

1105
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,340
I don't know if you people are joking.

1106
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,940
It's all up to interpretations.

1107
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:47,020
There is, I mean, the idea of color is an invention that we created.

1108
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,820
We named certain points in the spectrum of light, right?

1109
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,460
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. deGrasse Tyson.

1110
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,500
Yeah, sorry, I didn't know we had Mr. Dr. deGrasse Tyson on our show.

1111
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,740
But like, infrared encompasses like the entirety of the spectrum.

1112
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,060
You're walking down the block, Justin.

1113
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,700
You're walking down to the book shop.

1114
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,340
Shop or vegetable store.

1115
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,180
And you're walking and you turn the corner and just like,

1116
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,540
wow, there's a color you've never seen before.

1117
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,740
It's not purple.

1118
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,860
It ain't red.

1119
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,900
It ain't orange.

1120
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,540
It's not brown.

1121
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,140
Griffin, Griffin, Griffin, Griffin.

1122
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:33,260
What if there are animals all around us and their colors are ones we just can't see?

1123
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,220
Oh, beans.

1124
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:34,940
Oh, no.

1125
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,820
Are they dangerous?

1126
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,140
I don't know, Griffin.

1127
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,340
Are they?

1128
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,380
Shit.

1129
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,020
God, Trav, fuck, man.

1130
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,140
These are very red.

1131
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,620
And that-

1132
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,900
Yeah, like an infrared bear coming right at you.

1133
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,700
These cones can't see that bear.

1134
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,260
Oh, no.

1135
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:53,760
Right?

1136
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,220
What do you even do?

1137
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,740
What do you do, Justin?

1138
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,260
What do you do, Justin?

1139
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,780
Justin, get in here, dude.

1140
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,860
This play space is fun, dude.

1141
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,780
Get the fuck in here, man.

1142
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,100
To give you the setup in case you were looking at pictures of Elias Kodius,

1143
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,180
we're talking about like bears and wild animals that are like colors we can't see.

1144
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,060
So get in the space.

1145
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,380
Here we go.

1146
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,820
You're like ultraviolet and infrared bears that you just can't see.

1147
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,860
It doesn't make sense.

1148
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,300
Maybe there's even like a whole infrared world.

1149
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,620
Every time you stub your toe and you turn and you're like,

1150
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,100
what was that?

1151
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,380
Oh, I thought it was a chair.

1152
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,740
The chair seemed out of my way.

1153
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,660
You tripped over an infrared chair.

1154
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,460
Oh, gosh.

1155
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,700
What if they're real little and we're always stepping on them?

1156
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,580
Or what if we're real little and there's infrared giants stepping on us?

1157
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,300
Jesus.

1158
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,700
Oh, man.

1159
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,860
Maybe if you get like goose pimples or whatever,

1160
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,420
that's an infrared giant just messing with you.

1161
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:51,900
Shit.

1162
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,220
Right?

1163
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,500
Tickling me.

1164
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:54,860
Fuck.

1165
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,120
Ow.

1166
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,060
Just what do you even?

1167
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,740
What do you do?

1168
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,820
What do we do now that we've figured this out?

1169
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,620
We've seen through the veil.

1170
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,300
We've seen-

1171
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,340
We've seen-

1172
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,940
We've parted the curtain into another world that's all around us.

1173
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,580
What do we do?

1174
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,020
What do I do now?

1175
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,860
I can't go back to, you know, I'll never get in the car again.

1176
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,460
Every time I get in the car and drive from one place to another,

1177
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,980
I probably hit like 10 invisible deer or whatever.

1178
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,620
You've killed eight infrared bears.

1179
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,460
Just like going to the toy store to get a fidget spinner.

1180
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,580
Shit.

1181
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,620
Wait, I was going to get the fidget spinner or the bears were?

1182
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,500
Because I'm into either.

1183
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,220
Both.

1184
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,460
Okay.

1185
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,900
You were going the same direction.

1186
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,100
That's how you ran into them.

1187
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,860
I don't want to know how to break this to you guys.

1188
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,420
There are animals that can see ultraviolet.

1189
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,940
Well, that's why your dog gets really nervous sometimes.

1190
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,900
Yes, butterflies can see ultraviolet.

1191
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,180
How do you know, Justin?

1192
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,300
Do you speak butterfly?

1193
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:57,980
Got it.

1194
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,620
That is actually a pretty good question.

1195
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,140
How the fuck do we figure that out?

1196
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,820
Did you?

1197
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,580
I feel like you're trying to tell me something

1198
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,100
about like some incredible invisible ecosystem

1199
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,380
that I'm just not tapped into.

1200
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,940
Am I close?

1201
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,340
Did you use ultraviolet light to shine a sign above a little hole

1202
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,620
that said super horny butterflies down to fuck?

1203
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,100
Come on in if you're ready to party.

1204
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,980
A reindeer can see ultraviolet light too.

1205
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,460
Whoa.

1206
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,900
Do you think that's why Santa picked him?

1207
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,780
Reindeers are the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light.

1208
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,300
Do you think that's why Santa was like-

1209
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,340
Oh, yeah.

1210
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,420
I want to get one up on these motherfuckers.

1211
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,620
Yeah, I'm not trying to fly into a flock of invisible birds of prey.

1212
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,660
When butterflies fuck, I guess caterpillar comes out,

1213
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,180
you think they're disappointed every time?

1214
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,460
He looks like-

1215
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,820
They look at the caterpillar and they can see an ultraviolet butterfly

1216
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,780
spreading out from it?

1217
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,820
Oh, shit.

1218
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,180
This is beautiful.

1219
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,940
Are you saying that parents are disappointed?

1220
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,180
Oh, sweetie, he looks like-

1221
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,980
Oh, no.

1222
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,900
He's a worm like we used to be.

1223
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,460
Shoot.

1224
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,660
I was hoping maybe this time it'd be one of us beautiful.

1225
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,420
You know that armadillos are the only animals

1226
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,860
that can see into the future?

1227
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,340
Oh, no.

1228
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,660
Yeah, they just know.

1229
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,580
If you see an armadillo clear a room,

1230
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,260
you better follow right behind.

1231
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,740
He knows a piano's about to fall through the ceiling.

1232
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,460
Oh, no.

1233
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,780
Oh, no, he rolled into a ball.

1234
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,060
The piano fell through the ceiling.

1235
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,020
He saw this coming.

1236
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,980
Well, this is weird.

1237
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,340
I also just got my zoo books in the mail.

1238
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,460
It says turtles never die.

1239
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,980
Turtles live forever.

1240
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,740
There's only ever been like a hundred turtles,

1241
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,620
but it's the same one.

1242
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,180
It's crazy.

1243
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,220
Trav, did you know that's because armadillos

1244
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,500
get tomorrow's newspaper a day early every day?

1245
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,540
I did know that.

1246
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,100
Okay, I didn't know if you knew that or not.

1247
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:53,580
Okay.

1248
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,460
I did, actually.

1249
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,260
I just want to...

1250
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,940
Is there a color we don't know about yet

1251
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,780
that I'm going to see before I pass?

1252
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,180
In my lifetime, am I going to see this color?

1253
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,820
What if we came up...

1254
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,180
Let's come up with the color right now,

1255
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,660
and that'll be our legacy.

1256
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,300
This will be like,

1257
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,260
did you see this new color?

1258
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,760
And be like,

1259
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,100
whoa, that is...

1260
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,820
I've never seen...

1261
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,700
It's like blue,

1262
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,620
but it's not anything I've ever seen before.

1263
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,940
Griffin, I could try to make up a funny name,

1264
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,820
but there's already a colorful piece.

1265
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,380
I don't want a name.

1266
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,020
I don't want a name.

1267
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,780
The shade, the hue.

1268
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,140
So like, I'll close your eyes.

1269
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,100
Both of you guys close your eyes.

1270
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,460
Imagine...

1271
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,380
Let's start with...

1272
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,940
Imagine orange.

1273
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,980
You see an orange, the color?

1274
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,820
And now we're just going to put a little bit...

1275
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,820
Just a little bit of purple in there.

1276
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,380
Can you even imagine like what that meant?

1277
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,900
Like, try to blend it,

1278
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,460
and you're seeing a color you never saw before.

1279
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,820
What if the color is every color altogether,

1280
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,660
and that's the shade you can't see?

1281
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,900
Cheating, cheating, cheating, cheating.

1282
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,060
Or what if it's none of the colors?

1283
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:58,860
What if it's red?

1284
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,060
What if you take blue?

1285
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,580
Imagine the purest blue,

1286
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,940
and then add some yellow in there.

1287
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,340
How much yellow?

1288
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,940
However much...

1289
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,820
10 amount.

1290
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,620
10 yellows?

1291
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,180
Not too much.

1292
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:20,700
Yeah, and can your mind even...

1293
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,380
The color, Griffin?

1294
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,380
Let me tell you the shade.

1295
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,940
The shade is the color that you would get

1296
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,660
if you were able to push down all the tabs

1297
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,980
on the multicolored pen at once.

1298
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,460
Okay.

1299
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,620
That would be the color you wouldn't adopt.

1300
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,620
There's a reason you can't do that.

1301
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,140
CERN made those pins,

1302
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,220
and made it so you couldn't do that,

1303
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,620
or else you'll like punch a hole in space-time.

1304
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,340
Sydney got one of those pins in the 90s box

1305
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,660
that you and Rachel got her for her birthday,

1306
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,540
and it made me realize, one, those rule,

1307
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,940
two, I have not seen one in a grip.

1308
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,940
I don't know if they're still making those bad boys or not,

1309
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,580
but those are rad.

1310
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,860
Well, no, they're irresponsible

1311
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,380
because you push all three tabs down.

1312
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,820
See, a color you've never seen before,

1313
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,340
you go full-blown Lovecraft-like bonkers.

1314
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,260
You've made your own hadron collider.

1315
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,820
Well, folks, that's stupid.

1316
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,180
It's just stupid.

1317
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,740
The whole thing is dumb.

1318
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,540
I mean, I said if you combine blue and yellow,

1319
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,980
you make a color you've never seen before,

1320
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,940
and you two chucklefucks didn't say anything.

1321
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,700
It just, sometimes, guys, what are we doing here?

1322
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,500
Thanks for listening, though.

1323
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,940
We really do appreciate you.

1324
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,300
We hope you have fun listening.

1325
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,820
Trav, do you want to make the PodCon pitch one last time?

1326
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,780
Thank you very much.

1327
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,700
We are in the middle, right now, as we speak,

1328
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,900
raising funds to put on a podcast convention

1329
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,420
in Seattle this December.

1330
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,420
It is organized by me and the brothers McElroy,

1331
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,460
Hank and John Green, and the people behind

1332
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,020
Welcome to Night Vale, Joseph and Jeffrey,

1333
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,940
Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor.

1334
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,020
And it is both a chance to go and see

1335
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,980
some of your favorite podcast and podcasters perform live,

1336
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,060
but also a chance to get together with people

1337
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,740
who are not only fans, but also creators of podcasters,

1338
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,100
talk about the art form of podcasting.

1339
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,140
And you can help us make it a reality

1340
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,540
by going to podcon.com.

1341
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,580
We are doing an Indiegogo fundraiser right now.

1342
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,180
We're at about halfway there.

1343
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,540
And not only can you help us fund PodCon,

1344
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,300
but you also get, well, there's a whole bunch

1345
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,700
of different levels with a bunch of different rewards,

1346
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,260
including remote attendance.

1347
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,060
So even if you're not able to make it to Seattle

1348
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,620
on December 9th and 10th, you'll still be able

1349
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,700
to watch the shows and still be able to participate remotely.

1350
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,620
So go to podcon.com.

1351
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,660
When you hear this, you'll only have till,

1352
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,580
I believe, Tuesday at midnight.

1353
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,860
So there's not much time left.

1354
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,860
So go to podcon.com and then Tuesday from,

1355
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,780
I think like seven to midnight, somewhere around there,

1356
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,780
we'll be doing a live stream with like Hank and me

1357
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,620
and some people from Night Vale and other people

1358
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,340
to kind of help get the word out.

1359
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,540
So I'll tweet about that so you can keep an eye out.

1360
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,820
But yeah, we're really excited.

1361
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,500
We're gonna be doing a live My Brother, My Brother,

1362
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,860
and Me there.

1363
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,860
Also, Alice Isn't Dead, Dear Hank and John, Bad With Money,

1364
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:34,900
99% Invisible with Roman Mars, Sawbones, Still Buffering,

1365
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,900
A Night Called Tomorrow, Lore, Criminal.

1366
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,220
It's a really amazing lineup already.

1367
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,340
And it's just gonna get better.

1368
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,620
Yeah, like we're near done inviting people.

1369
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,420
There's a show called Last Name Basis

1370
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,700
that like we just announced that I'm really excited about.

1371
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm a big fan of theirs.

1372
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,860
And it's going to be a really good time.

1373
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,140
And we hope you all show up.

1374
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,220
But you can help us fund it, podcon.com.

1375
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,380
Thank you so much.

1376
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,020
I wanna thank John Roderick and Long Winters

1377
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,100
for using our theme song, It's a Departure,

1378
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,760
which is a song off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1379
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,460
It's a very good album that honestly,

1380
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,740
I haven't listened to in a little bit.

1381
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,780
I need to dip in.

1382
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,700
I like to recharge the old batteries every once in a while.

1383
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,780
You know what I mean?

1384
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,540
I also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,500

Speaking of stuff that we do, Justin,

1394
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,020
do you wanna give a quick plug

1395
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,180
to our new Prestige podcast?

1396
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,940
Yes, we have a new podcast.

1397
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,740
It's called The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls 2.

1398
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,340
You can find that on iTunes or Trolls2.Libson.com.

1399
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,980
That's right, we don't even have a website for it.

1400
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,780
That's how new it is.

1401
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,620
It's also on Twitter.

1402
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,840
I have no idea where.

1403
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,500
But we're trying to get in Trolls.

1404
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,100
No, we are in Trolls 2.

1405
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,140
We will be in Trolls 2.

1406
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,780
And this is a story about how it happens,

1407
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,260
but it's happening in real time.

1408
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,620
So it'll be archival.

1409
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,740
There's gonna be a lot of big developments.

1410
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,020
We just got two episodes up.

1411
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,700
The pilot that we released on this feed,

1412
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:24,180
and also the second episode with our hilarious agent Joel.

1413
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,600
And it's really fun.

1414
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,820
And it's great.

1415
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,460
So...

1416
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,500
Go check it out.

1417
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,740
Go check it out, totally.

1418
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,660
Totally check it out.

1419
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,700
One more quick plug.

1420
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,180
We have a TV show on CISO.com.

1421
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,920
And we put out on our podcast thread,

1422
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,920
on this very feed, an episode one commentary

1423
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,900
that you can listen to of us talk about

1424
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,860
making the show and stories on set and that kind of thing.

1425
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,140
So go to CISO.com.

1426
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,140
And now it's also available on iTunes

1427
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,980
in countries outside of the US.

1428
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,980
So I think it's the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia,

1429
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,060
and maybe other places as well.

1430
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,220
I'm not 100% sure about Germany.

1431
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,260
Now that I say it,

1432
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,860
I don't know if that sounds right or not.

1433
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,300
But go to your version of iTunes and find out.

1434
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,300
And then go to our feed

1435
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,020
and listen to the commentary on episode one.

1436
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,340
Hopefully we'll do more of those.

1437
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,460
No guarantees.

1438
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,740
We've already recorded episode two commentary though.

1439
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,500
So hopefully that'll be up in the future.

1440
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,840
Here's that final.

1441
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,460
This final was, weird enough, sent in by two people,

1442
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,900
JJ Jones and Nick Potter.

1443
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,900
Independently sent this in.

1444
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,100
Thank you, both.

1445
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1446
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,580
Piccione, it says.

1447
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,660
I'm gonna add a little bit here.

1448
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,580
A little bit of flavor here at the beginning.

1449
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,580
Hey, you like pigeons?

1450
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,660
My name is Justin McElroy.

1451
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1452
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,860
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1453
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,020
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1454
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,540
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1455

1456
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,260
Comedy and culture.

1457
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,340
Artist owned.

1458
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,540
Listener supported.

1459
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,660
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

1460
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,060
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

1461
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,900
Every week we release a medical history podcast

1462
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,620
called Sawbones.

1463
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,100
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest,

1464
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,500
weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each other

1465
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,140
since the dawn of mankind.

1466
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,740
But it's a funny show.

1467
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,500
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning,

1468
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,980
you won't believe it.

1469
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,300
But it's also like, funny, it's funny.

1470
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,460
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

1471
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,420
It's a real hoot.

1472
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,660
It's called Sawbones and we release it every week

1473
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,020
on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold,

1474
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:35,020
and right here on Maximumfun.org.
