1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, the advice show for the

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,880
Bajanera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy. I forgot what I say.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
Babiest.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Yep.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Yep. Folks, check your calendar. I'm sure it's probably beeping, and it's like, you're like,

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,720
what did I set it for? And it's because it's time for a fantastic beast, the Crimes of Grindelwald

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
Watch. That's right.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,840
It's Grindelwatch.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
Grindelwatch is here, folks.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,280
Can I tell you the weird thing, Justin? My calendar is beeping, but it's a paper wall calendar.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,800
Yep. It must have one of Grindelwald's wild enchantments on it.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,440
Yes, it must be a Grindelwald creation.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,640
I love it. Johnny Depp was like, I'll only play a character named Grindelwald because

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
that's what I am, IRL fam.

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,120
I like the series of Fantastic Beasts because it gives me the opportunity to feel what it

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,680
must have been like to be a grownup when Harry Potter was extremely popular.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
They're all wizards and witches, and it's all nonsense to me?

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Wait, what's happening? What is this?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
They manage these guys? Grindelwald?

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,920
They split the uprights of me, Griffin McElroy, who waited in line for a midnight release of

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,480
not just one, more than one of the Harry Potter books, to now, in 2018, having disdain for

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Grumblegord and his curse. That was me, and now it's so not me, Grumblegig.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,480
I just don't care about the works of Grumblegig. What's he doing? And also,

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,760
where's a little love for the mediocre beasts?

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,800
All your favorites are not here. I misspoke. None of your favorites are here. Nobody knows

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
the names of any of the characters. Nobody cares about this franchise, and yet it continues to

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,480
tread all along. I'm sure making buckets of cash. I just don't know who's-

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
Justin, now, I do want to say there are some Harry Potter series favorites in this one.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm pretty sure that Lord Voldemort, and I know that's taboo, but I'm not afraid of him anymore

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,880
because I saw Harry Potter kick his ass. He's in it, I think, somewhere. Looking forward to it.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,320
Got my tickets for release day, which I don't know what that is or what it is.

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,440
I just want to know where are these- All these people are so worried about their beautiful

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
beasts, and I just want to know what are you all doing to preserve the life of Lily and

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,880
James Potter because we have a chance, folks. You have one opportunity.

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Oh, shit, and then JK Rowling could just follow her dream and do a completely reimagined Harry

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,600
Potter series where she starts back at book one. Oh, and this time, Lily and James, totally alive.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Totally part of it. They're there. Everything's cool.

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,840
Not so close, fam. How is this flick two hours and 14 minutes long, fam?

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
The boy- Hey, y'all, hey, y'all, gather close. The boy ain't in it.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah. The boy ain't in it in this one.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,040
That's actually how he's known in this one. The boy who doesn't appear.

49
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,080
This is 134 minutes of boy-free material. The boy didn't saddle up for this ride, folks.

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,560
It's just Eddie Redman opening up his suitcase and letting out, I don't know, a dog with,

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,440
I don't know, a fish tail, or I don't know, a big bird. I haven't seen the first one either.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
I did. I watched that on a plane when I was three deep in the window, and y'all,

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,000
there's no way they're going to top the Buckwild twist ending of that movie, which was

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,880
this character has been disgraced shithead Johnny Depp the whole time. Surprise!

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,240
He's had a charm cast on him to make him look like someone else, but it was the whole time disgraced

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,080
piece of garbage shit Johnny Depp. Gotcha! Yeah, you did get us, I guess, Grimblewald.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
Grumblegust. He's just-

58
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
Rumbleghost.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Grumbleghost. Jonathan Depp called David Yates the director. He's like, hey, it's me, Johnny Depp.

60
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
Bad news. What is it, Johnny? You're going to have to add some more minutes.

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Do you remember those beasts that you said were too fantastic? You're going to have to include

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:23,040
them. Does Grimblewald eat the beasts? Is that his fantastic crimes, is that Eddie Redman opens up

63
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,520
his magic briefcase and the fairy hippopotamus comes out and Grimblewald eats him? Is that

64
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,680
the fantastic crime, just him slowly devouring every animal?

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,680
I want to take my nanny to the movie theater and make this her first exposure to the Harry Potter

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
series. So good.

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,880
I want her to get on board with the HP franchise from the crime of Grimblegust.

68
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,280
But start it here. This is her window in. This is where it starts. We're going to sit down

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,640
for two full Christian hours and 14 Christian minutes and watch the crimes of Binglebust

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,160
stroll across the screen doing magic hither and yon and get these beasts all riled up.

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,560
If you timed it right, you could go while the sun was out and then get out in the cover of night

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
and think that the end times have come. And then you can just say like, no, but then listen,

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800
there's two characters who are married that you haven't even met yet. They die,

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,000
but their son doesn't. And he goes on a great school adventure for eight years.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm sitting here looking at the rotten tomatoes on this one and I kid you not, it is sitting at

76
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:42,560
50 percent Hollywood glitterati. Our critics of this great industry we call showbiz could not

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,920
even be bothered to form an opinion. As one collective hive mind, they all shrugged and said,

78
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,440
I don't know, the boy's not in it, but it is extremely long.

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,680
This is like if you put out a Superman movie that was about when his dad was in high school,

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,120
or even worse, like when his dad's math teacher was in high school. And you're like, wait,

81
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,920
you call this- wait, why is- where's the Superman? Like, well, Superman's not even born yet.

82
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Why the fuck am I watching this movie? Well, the math teacher- well, his dad's math teacher wins

83
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,520
the science fair. It's like if the Star Wars prequels are about Emperor Palpatine's childhood

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,280
friend. I don't know how Rotten Tomatoes does their system, but the last review on here says,

85
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,400
a strangely charmless and excessively dingy film, too long and static for anyone but the

86
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,160
most diehard. With neither richness of tone nor color, this is a film guaranteed to sell tickets

87
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
at the cost of its own soul. And that's a positive one, apparently. Rotten Tomatoes said, this is a

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,800
thumbs up from this particular critic. This is a plump, juicy tomato you can definitely include in

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,560
your puttanesca. Hey, let's do advice, huh? We've dunked on this dumb movie a lot. Okay,

90
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,120
don't go see that movie. Don't go see the film. Don't go see Crime of Grimwall. But I don't have

91
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
to tell you that because you didn't go see the first one, if you're me. Now that it finally

92
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,160
feels like winter, my boyfriend has finally packed away his summer wardrobe. Turns out,

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
he only has maybe three pairs of jeans and three sweaters. So over the course of a work week,

94
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,440
he makes and matches different combinations to make five outfits that are all close but different

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,720
enough that no one notices he's re-wearing a sweater or a pair of pants by Friday. Today,

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,880
he wore the same sweaters yesterday with a different pair of pants. I told him people

97
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,280
are gonna notice. And if anything, he should wear the same jeans with a different sweater

98
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,200
because people are less likely to notice. He disagreed wholeheartedly and wore basically

99
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,080
the same outfit as yesterday to work today. So what's the official ruling, brothers? How close

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
can you wear things without people noticing and probably thinking you're a little weird and maybe

101
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,600
gross? That's from Brisk in Boston. Is this like an SAT prep test? Here's the thing about this

102
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,600
question that I think is missing. When you say no one noticed, what you mean is when your boyfriend

103
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,280
walked into work, nobody pointed at him and said, that's the same sweaters yesterday.

104
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
Just because no one did that doesn't mean they didn't notice. We're not in grade school anymore.

105
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
You can't convince yourself that your shit is cloaked just because people didn't bring it to

106
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,400
your immediate attention. Now, it depends on what the sweaters look like. If it's like a nice gray

107
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,360
pullover and like a red cardigan and maybe just like a nice blue knit dealie, then maybe you could

108
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,520
switch those out and people won't notice. But if one of the sweaters say like, I'm a real pizza

109
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,320
puppy and it has a picture of a dog eating a big slice of pizza on it and giving a thumbs up on a

110
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
skateboard, whenever that one comes up in the rotation, people are going to notice that it's

111
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,840
pizza puppy shirt time again. Damn. Now, okay, see, hold on. Now I got to send an email to the

112
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,560
FTBA to get this pizza puppy design into the store. We got to get this fast track.

113
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,360
And make sure you include all of the false starts of like sort of the beginning articles of the

114
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,520
pizza puppy that I sort of dropped and ate back up into my mouth. Maybe we're in like a Doug

115
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,080
scenario where it's three of the same sweaters and three of the same jeans. Let's talk about jeans,

116
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,560
because I think you can wear them shits many days in a row. And I think that you boys would be

117
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,400
inclined, especially in the cold months. It's the cold months. Fuck off. Like, right? Like,

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm just trying to survive. I'm going to wear the same jeans a lot. It's not like I'm doing anything

119
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:41,280
nasty to them. I put on a pair of raw shrink to fit Levi's on the day that we started filming

120
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:50,560
My Brother, My Brother and Me, the television series, September 17th of 2016. And I have worn

121
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,360
those jeans every day since. Not every day. Pretty much every day since. Wait, they've been your,

122
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,520
hold on, wait. I do know what I said. I do recognize that I said this, but that seems

123
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,240
excessive to me. That's what you do with denim. You live in denim. No, wait, hold on. Yeah. I've

124
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
seen how you live, Justin, and you have two small children that help you live in those pants.

125
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
I would argue they do not help you live in those pants. They hurt you live in those pants.

126
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,240
They contribute to the living you do in those pants. And make the jeans strong.

127
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Okay, he's got one strong pair of jeans. The jeans get strong. Powerful jeans.

128
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,640
Like Crusty maybe like builds up an exoskeleton. Crusty. If you lived in your jeans long enough,

129
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
they, you get a- If you lived in these jeans.

130
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,840
You live in these jeans. These are like the sisterhood of the traveling pants,

131
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,960
except I'm the one doing the traveling, not the pants.

132
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm the whole sisterhood. The whole one man sisterhood in these beautiful pants. I just,

133
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,400
if you get good denim and you wear it out, ask Jesse about this, if you get good denim.

134
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,840
There are denim heads that'll pay $10,000 for some old jeans they dug out of a coal mine

135
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,080
somebody died in. They'll like buy the jeans to get them and just wear them every day.

136
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
And you're not supposed to wash them. You wash them, not at first,

137
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,520
because you're going to lose a lot of the indigo. What you're trying to do is wear some lines into

138
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,640
them. And then you wear, you will lose a little bit of the color, but you're also going to get

139
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,920
some of those good wear lines. I'm saying jeans you wear every day.

140
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,320
And stink lines, you fucking junkyard baby. What are you doing?

141
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Travis. Hey, Travis, go. I want you to right now have a Memento style flashback

142
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,480
of all the times you've told me my jeans stink in the past 18 months. And when you come up a little

143
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,360
bit short there, Christopher Nolan, you're going to realize that you don't have any b-roll to put

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,480
into this montage because there ain't none. There ain't no times. He does got you there.

145
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,000
What's the appropriate, to make this more relatable, because I feel like I thought

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,720
my position was extreme and then Justin came shrieking into the room with his jeans that stand

147
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,800
up on their own. So let's come up with a more relatable rule, which is what is the appropriate

148
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:24,160
ratio of tops to long pants to have for every day wear to a workplace? Or school or whatever.

149
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,840
I don't give a shit. I work from home. I'll wear me on these lounge pants every fucking day.

150
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:35,200
I don't care. I have nothing. But for me, just going by my own closet, it's like six to one.

151
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,840
Six shirts to one pair of long pants. Maybe even more favoring the shirts.

152
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:46,080
Yeah, I would say somewhere between five to one. Especially when we're talking jeans,

153
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,520
there's something about a khaki or linen that's like maybe two days. But jeans,

154
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,880
I feel like you could do jeans for a week. But the thing is, we're not talking about

155
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,160
wear. We're talking about you're going to work in front of other human beings.

156
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,080
You need as many shirts as you have days of work.

157
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes.

158
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,840
You need as many shirts as you could wear in a work week. And you probably,

159
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,240
if you have just one extra, then you're mustard proof. But currently you live in a world,

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
I don't want you to live in a world that can be upended by mustard.

161
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,680
And that is the precarious situation you find yourself in.

162
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,200
Right now you could lose 33.3% repeating of your wardrobe to a mustard incident.

163
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah.

164
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
There's no peace of mind there.

165
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
The stakes are way too high. You could never eat a hot dog.

166
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
When you're eating steaks, the stakes are too high.

167
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
How about a Yahoo?

168
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes.

169
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,760
This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit. It's Yahoo Answers user,

170
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
Kimmity Cricket. What's wrong?

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,400
Nothing. I'm just excited. It sounded good.

172
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
All right. Kimmity Cricket asks,

173
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,760
if you could talk to everyone in the world at the same time, what would your message be to them?

174
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
I.e. don't use abusive comments.

175
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
Okay. All right.

176
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,640
You all realize, Bruce Almighty, you can talk, you can shoot out one message.

177
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,440
You've grabbed the grocery store, like check out my PA microphone of the planet

178
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,520
and say something into every human being's brain all at the same time.

179
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Let's say just for argument's sake, it is babble fish translated into every

180
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,840
imaginable language simultaneously.

181
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,720
You get one message to just blast out there, but one sentence and you can't get,

182
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
you know, we oughta baby eats a boy with it.

183
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,240
What is your message?

184
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,440
I know what you did. No.

185
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,080
No, Travis, you made a joke and you didn't even think about it.

186
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
You came up with that before I even finished reading the question.

187
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,760
This is important. We could solve some shit here.

188
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Okay. Well, I mean, my honest answer would probably be something about myself.

189
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
Okay. Give me that.

190
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,520
Give me that answer.

191
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,280
It would probably be something like, I am Travis, you belong to me now.

192
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
Something along those lines.

193
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
That would be cool.

194
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,280
I am Travis, protector of man.

195
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,360
Or like something that really establishes like my godhood,

196
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,760
I think would be how I would use it.

197
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,880
See, I was trying to think of like, if we could get anything closer to world peace,

198
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,040
but your solution might have a sort of like watchman-like effect where everybody would

199
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,120
become so scared of the god voice, Travis, that they would all band together to like

200
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
defend themselves for when his judgment descends.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,960
It could go the other way, Griffin, of like, they all feel so embraced by god Travis that

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,640
they're like, what's the point of even fighting when we all know and love Travis?

203
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
It's too dangerous, too dangerous, too dangerous.

204
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,080
Your attack is too dangerous.

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,720
I feel like whatever the message is, it has to start with,

206
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
everyone be chill.

207
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
I know this is wild.

208
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,040
But, and then you can say whatever, like, I really, hey-

209
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,320
Check out my Insta.

210
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,440
Here's my new mixtape.

211
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,360
My mixtape is on fire.

212
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
It's WW, oh no, I ran out of-

213
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Go to buttercupisaveyagoodgirl.com and check out pictures of my dog.

214
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,240
This is Travis, by the way.

215
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,680
Teengoogle.com.

216
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Oh, I still have more?

217
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
Bring back Tastations.

218
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,840
420-420-

219
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
How long is the message or is the length of the message?

220
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,360
You'll know.

221
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,680
You'll get a little light that blinks when it's time to wrap up.

222
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
I think mine would be like, everybody be chill.

223
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,840
I know this is weird, but, and then I would just write Beekman, greater sign,

224
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,160
pointing towards Beekman, and Bill Nye.

225
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
Because I want to get it out there that I think Beekman was the superior show.

226
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Beekman's World was a lot better than Bill Nye the Science Guy.

227
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,760
I've been watching a lot of it on TV, and I just want to say that Beekman was better.

228
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,640
But there's going to be like a four-year-old living in Turkey who's like,

229
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, God Voice.

230
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
No, unless it was, no, not in Spain, though.

231
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,160
In Spain and in Latin America, they're going to go nuts for it because they don't love-

232
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
They love Paul Zalum.

233
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
They love his world that he created.

234
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,680
But it's not a message that just reaches Latin America, Justin.

235
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,480
It's the world, and I got to have something for everyone.

236
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,400
What about everybody lean to the left, and we see if we can throw off the world's rotation?

237
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh, that's fun.

238
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,080
That could be cool.

239
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,960
Hey, everyone, I know this is weird, but be chill about it.

240
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,240
But just give a freaking hug.

241
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,560
That's the love language that spreads across all the world.

242
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,760
Not everybody likes hugs, Griffin.

243
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah, but yeah, you're right.

244
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,880
Maybe like a knowing nod.

245
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,480
Hey, everyone, nod at your friend.

246
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,560
This is weird.

247
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,840
So sorry to intrude.

248
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,680
But give a knowing nod to a nearby person.

249
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,280
I worry, though, if we end up with a simultaneous worldwide nod,

250
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
that would also throw off the world's rotation.

251
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,440
Everybody pick a random number of seconds and then nod at each other.

252
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,680
Yeah.

253
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah.

254
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
That way we can stagger it.

255
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
You know what could be really cool?

256
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
If you could be like, hey, everybody, I know this is scary,

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
but everything's gonna be okay, but listen, a sphincter says what?

258
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,760
What about like, hey, everybody, I know this is weird, but be chill.

259
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,200
Party at Derek's.

260
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
And then everyone, the world would implode.

261
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160
Like there would be a sinkhole at Derek's house.

262
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,800
Because all, what, there's like seven billion of us?

263
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,760
Which Derek, Griffin?

264
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
They would know.

265
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
I think they would know your intent.

266
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,920
You're right, I would have to say like, party at Derek F's.

267
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
I am, okay, you know what, guys?

268
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm probably thinking too much about this

269
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,000
because I'm starting to come around to this being an extremely good question.

270
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:58,960
Yeah, no, for sure.

271
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
I don't know what I would, if you have the ability to say,

272
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,080
see, it's not like, you know, there's this concept of,

273
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,800
if you point too much traffic at a website, they're not ready for it.

274
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,080
You're gonna like melt the whole site.

275
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,640
I feel like you could do that to anything with the world's attention.

276
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
Like there's nobody, individually,

277
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
that's going to be able to withstand complete like world attention.

278
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Which is what you would get, I think, with this sort of like awareness bombing.

279
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,080
We could not accomplish anything specific or explicit, is what you're saying.

280
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
Because anything we directed the world's attention to,

281
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,280
so it has to be some sort of general message of mental well-being.

282
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,480
And I think it also feels like it would have to be an inception kind of thing.

283
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
I don't think we could say like everyone be nice.

284
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
I think it would have to be like, for example,

285
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
maybe you have like a product that you want to go viral,

286
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,960
like you want the next Pogs, or you want, you have the next like Beanie Babies,

287
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
or let's say like Pet Rock.

288
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,280
Pet Rock would be a great example.

289
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Like you could send everyone a moment of saying like,

290
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,840
haven't you always wanted a pet that doesn't wander off?

291
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,280
But this is gonna, Travis, you're like really not listening,

292
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
because this would destroy the Pet Rock industry.

293
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
If all people on earth got horny for it, like we would run out of Pet Rock.

294
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah, so it has to be, can I give you guys maybe the answer?

295
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,000
Because this is, mine's almost threatening in a way,

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,120
which is kind of like, it's like good for the spirit, but threatening,

297
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
which is like kind of like deity-like.

298
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,640
But it should be like, hey everybody, I know this is weird, but be chill about it.

299
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
But listen, mean people suck.

300
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,320
And then people hear that and they're like, wow, well, we know what not to be.

301
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
And then they put a little love in their hearts.

302
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Okay, I think I know what I would actually write.

303
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,200
Okay.

304
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,360
I think I would write, hey, it's God.

305
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,640
Whoa.

306
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm out, okay.

307
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,280
Whoa.

308
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,160
Whoa, what?

309
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,920
Whoa, hold on, here's what I'm saying.

310
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
I would say, hey, it's God, I'm out.

311
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Yep, I was real the whole time, but now I'm done-ski.

312
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,080
Y'all got it from your own.

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
Y'all got it from here.

314
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,480
I was real, but I'm out.

315
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
So y'all got it from here on out.

316
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,120
That seems like a bad one to do.

317
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
Yeah, that seems like that's actually the beginning of revelations.

318
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,400
Yeah, it kind of seems like maybe you accidentally did the apocalypse.

319
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,680
No, I think that mine, if you're coming at things from like,

320
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,960
I think God would say like, hey, y'all be good to each other, keep it chill,

321
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,760
but it isn't your individual hands, so please try to keep it sexy down there.

322
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,480
Either way.

323
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
Well, just say that.

324
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,840
You don't have to pretend to be the Lord abandoning his sheep.

325
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,320
You don't have to pretend to be the king of kings abandoning his flock.

326
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,960
You can just say, hey, keep it sexy down there.

327
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
No, no, no.

328
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,240
I don't want people to try to continue to interpret my story.

329
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
I want them to continue to interpret my will.

330
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,720
I want them to know that I was real for a while, but now I'm going to leave,

331
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
and they should try to keep their fucking shit together for a second.

332
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
Well, then why not leave some ambiguity then and say like, I am God.

333
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
I may or may not be leaving.

334
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
It doesn't really matter.

335
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
This is untenable.

336
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,680
I am God.

337
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm out.

338
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
I'll be back in 25.

339
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,080
Keep it, oh my God.

340
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,960
Hey, I'm God.

341
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey, it's me, God.

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
I can't fix it, because that would be a powerful message.

343
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
Now we are talking.

344
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes, yes, yes.

345
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,160
It's me, God.

346
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Climate change is real, and it's out of my hands.

347
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,960
And so am I.

348
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,760
So am I.

349
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
Here's two things that is real.

350
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,560
Climate change would be, and here's something else that's real.

351
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,800
I don't know about this one, gang, honestly.

352
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't know what to do.

353
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,160
You all fucked up my world.

354
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200
I made it so good.

355
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,680
I thought I made it so good you couldn't break it, but look at this.

356
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
You done broke it.

357
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Yeah.

358
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Anyway, check out my SoundCloud.

359
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:07,040
It's 10, here's another question for the haters.

360
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
This is just for the haters.

361
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,960
I recently went out for dinner with my girlfriend and some friends.

362
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,560
We shared some appetizers, and I split an entree with my girlfriend.

363
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,240
When the waiter came around and asked if we wanted dessert, everyone said no.

364
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
Brothers, I really wanted that chocolate lava cake,

365
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,920
but I didn't want to be the only one eating dessert.

366
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,240
What could I have said or done during the meal or after to prevent this tragedy?

367
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,160
And this from over-ordering in Ontario, Canada, I presume.

368
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,280
This is maybe the best question we've ever gotten, so thank you for sending it in.

369
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,520
Wow.

370
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,880
There's a lot of dining etiquette with your friends,

371
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,680
and a lot of this has been solved with technology.

372
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Stuff like Venmo or Splitwise or whatever.

373
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,320
Vin Diesel.

374
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,760
Vin Diesel, right.

375
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
The appetizer you order, maybe not everybody gets a hand on that ball,

376
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,680
so they don't, you know, have some of that.

377
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,920
The entrees, maybe yours was more expensive than them.

378
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
You have apps to deal with that.

379
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,840
If you're the only one that wants dessert, now it's also a time issue.

380
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,040
And I've been in this situation a lot.

381
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,560
I just don't ever get the dessert.

382
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,440
And it's my fault.

383
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,480
It's my fault because I am not friends with the Sweet Tooth gang.

384
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I need to make Sweet Tooth friends.

385
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
Here's the thing.

386
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Here's the thing, Griffin.

387
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,680
Here's what you are doing wrong, as well as I wonderful,

388
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,160
I appreciate them so much, question asker.

389
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,000
And that is, you think you're the only one who wants dessert,

390
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
so you didn't speak up.

391
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,280
Everyone at the table is that.

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,760
Oh, okay.

393
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,720
Everyone at the, I have never, I've never been in this scenario

394
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
where I said, you know what, I would like dessert.

395
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,880
And everyone else hasn't gotten, well, like,

396
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,920
whoa, if you're gonna do it.

397
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
That's true.

398
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
And in every, here's the real bellwether.

399
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,920
Pick the dessert you want and say you want however many forks

400
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,440
are for the people at the table.

401
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,920
So good.

402
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,600
Watch those motherfuckers not be like, oh, none for me, thank you.

403
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,200
No, they're gonna have a fork.

404
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,640
And you know what else they're gonna do?

405
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
Guaranteed 80% of the time, someone at the table is gonna be like,

406
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,800
well, if you're getting that, then I actually want the other one.

407
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Eventually, you will have every dessert in the restaurant

408
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,080
brought to your table.

409
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
Everybody's got a fork.

410
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
They're loving it.

411
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,560
They're enjoying, like, you're having a meal with friends

412
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
and now you're splitting a delicious dessert.

413
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,440
That's what we're on the fucking planet for, gang.

414
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
This is what we are here for.

415
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,280
And it's to reach out and grab this dessert that we're all here for.

416
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
Let me tell you, here's the trick.

417
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,640
What you do is you ask the server, the waitstaff person,

418
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
to list the desserts out loud.

419
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,240
Because when someone's looking at a paper, right,

420
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,160
that's not a shared communal experience.

421
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,880
Just ask and as they're listing them out loud,

422
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
you make eye contact with everyone at the table

423
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,760
and kind of nod a little bit, like, whoa, whoo.

424
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
Ooh, that sounds good.

425
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,520
Before any time has passed, you're having, like,

426
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,240
a full-on, like, hedonistic dessert party.

427
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
Have you ever been to a restaurant where they do the thing

428
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,000
where they bring out, like, fake desserts for you to enjoy

429
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,760
and you can, like, pick them from the fake ones?

430
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
I've never done that before.

431
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,040
But I've always kind of wondered what it would be like.

432
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,240
It's pretty boss, dude.

433
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Yeah, as good as I imagined it would be.

434
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,160
I've also been to a place where they brought out my steak

435
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,120
pre-cooked, showed it to me, and said,

436
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
is it, this looks good, right?

437
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
And then went and cooked it.

438
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,320
Here's a little teaser trailer for you, Trap.

439
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
Well, this one is plastic.

440
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,720
We will throw it away.

441
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,800
Why don't we do this with a whole menu

442
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,560
where they bring out, there's just sort of, like,

443
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,640
a very strong sort of Lou Ferrigno type

444
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,400
who's carrying many trays out

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,960
and has every possible thing you could eat.

446
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,040
And he kind of walks it around the restaurant

447
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,360
constantly, sort of like somebody announcing the rounds

448
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
at a prize fight or something like that.

449
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
And then you can pick it off.

450
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,800
I'll have what Lou Ferrigno is having

451
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,240
on his left pectoral muscle.

452
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,760
I believe that's the lasagna.

453
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,040
I think we can all agree, like, the second most exciting thing

454
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,640
when you go to Red Lobster is the big tank of lobsters

455
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
and you pick your own lobster.

456
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
So good, so good.

457
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
The first most exciting thing

458
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,400
is when the best biscuits come out.

459
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,840
But the lobster in the tank,

460
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,920
what if we just did that for fucking every,

461
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
like you went in and said,

462
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,120
and that's the broccoli I'll be having?

463
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,440
Yeah.

464
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,280
With like that potato,

465
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
like the control you would feel.

466
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,320
But the potato's floating in a big fish tank.

467
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,480
Yeah, he's got googly eyes on him.

468
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,720
They all have name tags.

469
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,840
There should be a combination of groceries to a restaurant

470
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
where you go grocery shopping

471
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
and then you take your bags of groceries

472
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,680
and you just upend them in the kitchen.

473
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
So here, I can't.

474
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,520
I've picked the freshest, all the finest,

475
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
and all the freshest and fine.

476
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
I've picked the freshest and the finest.

477
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
Please make this into dinner for me.

478
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
You know some chopped heads though

479
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
would go in there with like some gummy bears,

480
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,760
some jasmine rice, some surge and pork tummy

481
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,360
and say like, do it, do it.

482
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
Ha ha ha, you have 30 minutes.

483
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Those LOL dolls were clearly for my daughter.

484
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,680
They weren't part of the meal and you know it.

485
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,720
You've shamed me.

486
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,000
But they are delicious.

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
This is very good.

488
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,240
Yeah, this is very good.

489
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
You guys ever do that thing

490
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,720
where you know you need to go to the grocery store

491
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,400
and you put it off for so long

492
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
that you end up coming home right at dinner time

493
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
and you're in hell because all of a sudden

494
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,280
you have no dinner and all these groceries to unload

495
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
and no way to get dinner?

496
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
Have you guys ever done that?

497
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
Because I think that's a great time to order pizza.

498
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,320
Ha ha ha.

499
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Who is this guy?

500
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,560
Who's this character?

501
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,320
So if I'm following you, Justin,

502
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
what you're saying is,

503
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,680
the problem is when you bring food home,

504
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,640
you're faced with,

505
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
well, now I have to do something with the food.

506
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,720
No, I'd rather not.

507
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,600
It's pizza o'clock.

508
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, I'm just saying that's a great time for my family

509
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
for us to all order pizza.

510
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
Honey, let's make it a night in with pizza.

511
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
But you just went to the store.

512
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
You have brought-

513
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,280
Travis, quit fucking contradicting

514
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,080
this incredible character Justin has said.

515
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
Justin's created a new character here

516
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,520
who I'm very enthusiastic about,

517
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,800
which is time for pizza.

518
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,920
Okay, we've got the pilot of Justin's sitcom,

519
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,760
Time for Pizza, with Justin.

520
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm exhausted.

521
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
I went to the store

522
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,080
and I've bought all the freshest and finest

523
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
and I don't want to cook anymore, honey,

524
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,720
because I'm so tired from buying the groceries

525
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,160
and I just was thinking,

526
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,760
how about you and me and the kids?

527
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
Rent Paddington 2 from Redbox.

528
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
Wait, from Redbox?

529
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,920
You're already home.

530
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,160
Are you going to go back out to get the Paddington 2?

531
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,600
The Rite Aid across the street

532
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
that doesn't have any good groceries

533
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,960
that does have a pretty good Redbox selection.

534
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
They're going to rent Paddington 2

535
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
and we're going to get a pizza tonight.

536
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
Right on the special request

537
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,200
of the Domino's pizza tracker.

538
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,680
Could you just grab me Paddington 2 on the way?

539
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,120
You can even stop by Rite Aid.

540
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,760
That'd be great.

541
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
They used to have,

542
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
you remember for a while some chain had a deal

543
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,680
where they'd bring you a DVD inside your pizza.

544
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,160
I just remember they had a Drop Dead Fred

545
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,040
was one of the options.

546
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,440
So you could get Drop Dead Fred delivered to your house.

547
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,160
And that was last year that they offered that,

548
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,200
which was weird.

549
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,160
The problem is the FBI saw that as domestic terrorism

550
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,520
so they had to very much stop.

551
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,480
Should we Money Zone?

552
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,120
Yes, let's.

553
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:34,480
Yeah, let's do it.

554
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Pizza Hut was giving away the films available

555
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
or Bill and Ted Zamboni's journey,

556
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,

557
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
Mr. Mom and Honeymoon in Vegas.

558
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,840
Are you fucking with me?

559
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,400
Wow.

560
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,040
So good.

561
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,120
I'll have four pizzas please so that I can complete this set.

562
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,680
Yeah, I'm gonna need to get four pizzas.

563
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
Hey, stamps are great

564
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
and you're gonna need them this holiday season

565
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
because this is the time of year

566
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,920
where you're shipping off all of your stuff.

567
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
You got presents of,

568
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
you made a present of socks.

569
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
You're gonna need to ship those off

570
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,320
and they don't let you just put it in the mailbox

571
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
without some of this postage on it.

572
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,560
But thankfully stamps.com can save you a bunch of time

573
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
during the hectic holiday season

574
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,240
because it lets you buy and print official US postage

575
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

576
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
using your own computer and printer.

577
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,280
Then the mail carrier picks it up.

578
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,960
No trips to the post office required.

579
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,680
You're gonna save time.

580
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
You're gonna save money.

581
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,400
Stamps.com is really the best gift

582
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,480
you can give yourself this holiday season.

583
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,440
It's so convenient.

584
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,880
We're professional businessmen,

585
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,400
small business owners technically.

586
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,040
Wait, what?

587
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880
We're always doing mail

588
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,560
and fortunately we have a friend in stamps.com.

589
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,640
So you can enjoy the stamps.com service

590
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
with a special offer that includes a four-week trial

591
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
plus postage and a digital scale

592
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
without long-term commitments.

593
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,040
Go to stamps.com,

594
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,800
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

595
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
and type in my brother, that's stamps.com.

596
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,880
Enter my brother, all one word.

597
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,040
Listen, there's some things out there

598
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
that aren't super fun to think about

599
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,800
like taxes or like when you get home from the supermarket

600
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
and you have all your groceries

601
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,600
and it's like, well, now I gotta make dinner.

602
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,200
Oh, time for pizza, right?

603
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,760
And also you have to get life insurance

604
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,160
and it's not super fun.

605
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,560
Like Teresa and I just like did our wills

606
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,960
which is like a huge bummer

607
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,280
but I can tell you that life insurance,

608
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
once you've got it

609
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,480
and you don't have to worry about it anymore,

610
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,160
it's a really good feeling.

611
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,720
So we wanna tell you about policy genius.

612
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
Policy genius is the easy way

613
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,800
to get life insurance online in just two minutes.

614
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,120
You can compare quotes from top insurers

615
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,800
to find the best policy for you.

616
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,880
They also compare disability insurance,

617
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,800
auto insurance and home insurance.

618
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,920
So if you care about it, they cover it.

619
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,640
So if you've been avoiding getting life insurance

620
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
because it's difficult or confusing,

621
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,400
give policy genius a try.

622
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,720

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120

You can do the whole thing on your phone right now.

625

Policy genius, the easy way to compare

626
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
and buy life insurance.

627
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,080
I got a message for Walt and Liz

628
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,520
and it's from Knick, Ram, Will, Max, Julia, Miles and Dave.

629
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,640
It says, Walt and Liz, congratulations on your engagement.

630
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,360
All of your D&D pals are wishing you the absolute best

631
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,800
the next year at D&D, Destiny and whatever new venue

632
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,080
for hijinks we can imagine.

633
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,880
On behalf of Maxwell, Ram, Knick, Julia, Miles and Dave,

634
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,640
we couldn't think of a better way to say it

635
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,480
than with the help of these brothers, you rock.

636
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,160
And that's for April 17th.

637
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,360
That's my birthday and your engagement day.

638
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,920
Congratulations on this wonderful commitment.

639
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,400
And it's also seven Gregorian months ago.

640
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,080
That's fine because they wanted a good year at Destiny

641
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,320
and I gotta tell you, it's been great.

642
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
All my pals on there have been getting the best

643
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
and biggest guns and I did find Master Chief in the game

644
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,680
and Bungie sent me $500.

645
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
There's another message here and it's for Alyssa

646
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,520
and it's from Madeline or Madeline perhaps

647
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,280
who and Alyssa says, happy birthday to my friend,

648
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,600
my style icon, my favorite buff baby

649
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,280
and my fellow trash person.

650
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,360
Thank you for introducing me to Taz, Bim Bam

651
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
and to countless clever turns of phrase

652
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,560
that I have promptly stolen.

653
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,880
Being friends with you has made me a better person

654
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,760
and I love you.

655
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,600
This is a, that's one of those word thieves

656
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
and I think we gotta crack down on this.

657
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
We've been letting word thieves off for too long.

658
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,760
I don't have an end to that sentence.

659
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,840
The problem, well, that's because someone stole it.

660
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,040
Shit birds.

661
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,800
Yeah, you were gonna have an end to that sentence

662
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
and someone just swiped right in.

663
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
Hi, I'm Dave.

664
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
Hi, I'm Graham.

665
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped

666
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
inside our drum machine.

667
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,800
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by

668
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
and visited us every week

669
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,800
on Stop Podcasting Yourself here on MaximumFun.org.

670
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,760
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada.

671
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,840
And listen to our show or perish.

672
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:12,240
Shh, stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

673
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,760
There's a Yahoo, can I read?

674
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,920
Or Justin, do you have one of your great segments?

675
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,480
No, I don't have a segment.

676
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I just wanted to say that Papa John's

677
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,400
did the movie thing too.

678
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,000
And their offerings were Seen It Junior,

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,440
The Best of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,

680
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,200
Durango Kids, or A Weekend at Bernie's 2.

681
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
Jeez.

682
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,960
You know that last one was just because

683
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,920
Father John thought it was the funniest flick.

684
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,440
The funniest shit.

685
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
When they made this promotion,

686
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200
is it because they like found a box of DVDs

687
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
like at a landfill or something?

688
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,240
And they were like, well, we've got these.

689
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
I bet you a copy of the Papa John's

690
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
cuts of Rocky and Bullwinkle's

691
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,560
gotta be worth like a good 10 large these days.

692
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,520
10 large pizzas?

693
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Yes, this Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

694
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
Thank you, it's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

695
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,040
who I'm gonna call Father John, who asks,

696
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,360
is it normal to be bored in ballet class?

697
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,080
I want to be a ballerina,

698
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,280
but sometimes I get bored or don't wanna go to class.

699
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,080
Is this normal?

700
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
It's a great question.

701
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,040
Can you want to be a ballerina extremely badly

702
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
and also be really bored by ballet

703
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,400
and the learning it and you don't wanna do it?

704
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,920
Tough.

705
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,760
And I would argue that that is how

706
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
like revolutionary ballerinas are born.

707
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
I see.

708
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Right, because you're dancing there in class

709
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,000
and you're like, ugh, so boring.

710
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
But then maybe you make a friend

711
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
and the dance that your friend does is like,

712
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
really like, oh, what you're doing

713
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,400
out there dancing, I don't know,

714
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
on top of trash cans or whatever.

715
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,360
Like that's the kind of dancing I should be doing.

716
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,440
Let's dance together down the sidewalk,

717
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
but I'm gonna combine my ballet dancing

718
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
with your like cool new dancing.

719
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,120
And now we've got, I don't know, good dancing.

720
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,680
Look out Bob Fosse, we're good dancing.

721
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Bob Fosse sees it and explodes.

722
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
Oh no, we've killed Bob Fosse.

723
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I tried to go to ballet class once.

724
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
I showed up and they were like,

725
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,240
where are your special shoes?

726
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
And I said, I have no idea where y'all are getting

727
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,120
these incredible special shoes for ballet.

728
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,920
And they threw me out.

729
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
I never, they never let me take a class there.

730
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,200
I've been to plenty of paylesses in my day.

731
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
I practically lived out of a payless through college.

732
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,760
Never saw a single one of those kinds of special shoes

733
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,360
that they said that were everywhere.

734
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Yeah, I've seen a lot of movies.

735
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,720
And as far as I can tell-

736
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
Thanks Trev, that's a great point.

737
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,640
Well, I'm not done.

738
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah, I know.

739
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,280
I thought it'd be funny if I pretended like

740
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
that was all you were saying is about

741
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,920
how many movies you've seen.

742
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,600
I've seen a lot of movies, mostly through pizza companies.

743
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,680
And I've seen a lot of movies-

744
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,240
Here gang, all the movies I've ever seen are from pizza.

745
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,800
And let me hear, I'm here to tell you, movies aren't good.

746
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,320
Like don't enjoy them.

747
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
I don't know what all the hubbub is about.

748
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,120
Movies are really bad.

749
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,640
And sometimes they make sequels

750
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,400
without making the original movie.

751
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,880
And I think that that's-

752
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,960
They didn't introduce any of the characters.

753
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,720
I didn't know what was going on.

754
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,800
But I'm pretty sure you get ballet shoes

755
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
when you ask your papa.

756
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,600
And your papa says that your family can't afford them.

757
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,800
But then your papa, I don't know,

758
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,160
either strikes it rich or like-

759
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,640
Sells his magic pocket watch to afford.

760
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,680
Something like that.

761
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,400
And then like, happy birthday, ballet shoes.

762
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,360
Elves make them.

763
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,840
But we're dodging the question,

764
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,080
which is that the class is so fucking boring.

765
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,160
I want to be a ballerina so bad.

766
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,680
God, I want to be a ballerina so bad.

767
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,360
But I hate the dancing that they do

768
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,880
because it puts me to sleep.

769
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,000
God.

770
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,840
Maybe it's the other people in the class.

771
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,280
You know, maybe it's not the dancing,

772
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,320
but rather like there's just no drama happening.

773
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,040
It's possible, yeah.

774
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,400
It could just have a boring teacher.

775
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,600
You could have Ben Stein up there.

776
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
But like, if I was doing the dance,

777
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,400
you know, the dance.

778
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,280
And then I looked over and it was like,

779
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,240
I wish that those two people were gossiping.

780
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
Or I wish I hated them.

781
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,320
You know, something like that just to keep it spicy.

782
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,280
You saw Black Swan and thought that it was gonna be cool,

783
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
like that movie where all that cool stuff happens.

784
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
I did once on a bus trip to New York with my choir,

785
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
watch Center Stage like six times in a row.

786
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
And it gave me, I would say,

787
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,960
a skewed perspective on what the professional dance world is like.

788
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,800
A lot of backstabbing.

789
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,640
A lot of backstabbing.

790
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
A lot of love triangles.

791
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,200
My only exposure, excuse me, teacher, teacher,

792
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
my only exposure to ballet before this,

793
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,600
my first ballerina lesson, was Suspiria.

794
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,840
So where is the witch who lives in the mirror?

795
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,240
Because that seemed like an integral part of learning,

796
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,400
you know, the different positions and stuff.

797
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,280
What was the one with Julia Stiles?

798
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,400
Save the Last Dance.

799
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Was that that one?

800
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,880
Isn't that the movie you were talking about for a long time?

801
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Yes, it was for like two years.

802
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,440
But I couldn't remember the title.

803
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
Yeah, it was Save the Last Dance.

804
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
They should make a prequel to that.

805
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,240
Justin, please save us.

806
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
Justin, please save us from this.

807
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
Save the Pinocchio Dance.

808
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,560
He saved it.

809
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,280
Well, damn.

810
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,120
Or what if it was just called Use Up All the Other Dances?

811
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,360
Yeah.

812
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,160
Waste the dances, but save the last dance.

813
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
So how about another question?

814
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,160
Bring a Game Boy.

815
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,760
Bring a Game Boy to ballerina class

816
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,120
and you can play Tetris and Pokemans and Bubble Bobble

817
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,040
and Kicks and Qbert and all of the real games for real gamers.

818
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,480
The Flash while you learn how to step on the tips,

819
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
tippy tips of your toes.

820
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,240
Like gravity doesn't apply to you like a beautiful bird.

821
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,600
Justin, what's the next question?

822
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,640
My boyfriend and I were traveling in New Zealand

823
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,800
and we happened to be there for our anniversary.

824
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,160
So we decided to go to the local aquarium to celebrate.

825
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,760
We were in a small town.

826
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
You don't have to make excuses for going to the aquarium.

827
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,720
Aquariums are great.

828
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,640
However, upon entering,

829
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,920
we realized it doubled as the town's movie theater

830
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,160
and in order to get to the showing,

831
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,400
you had to walk through the aquarium.

832
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
Tickets to the movies were about half as much

833
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,640
as tickets to the aquarium.

834
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,480
Even though the aquarium itself was so small,

835
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,840
you could basically see the whole thing on your way

836
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,280
to whatever movie you were seeing.

837
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
But staff told you to keep your eyes down

838
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,560
and not to linger if you needed to leave the theater

839
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,320
to use the aquarium's bathroom.

840
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,280
Holy shit.

841
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,800
My question is, which is less morally depraved?

842
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,120
Sneaking into a movie or sneaking into an aquarium,

843
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,960
especially when they're in the same building?

844
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,720
And that's from Still Confusing Cape Cod.

845
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,560
This is a great question,

846
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,120
but I would have to say for this question to apply,

847
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,680
they would have to both be in the same building.

848
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,640
Yeah, this is an extremely deeply not relatable question

849
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,560
because this is the only building on earth

850
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,720
where this situation will ever be an issue.

851
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,960
I do gotta say it's a challenging one though

852
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,560
because you're in there, you're watching Grimblewood's crimes

853
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,800
and all of the great acting

854
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,880
makes you wanna just piss your pants.

855
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,200
And so you stand up and you go

856
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,360
and while you're about to go to the bathroom,

857
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,640
you're walking on your way there

858
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,240
and you're hustling because you don't wanna miss any crimes.

859
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
They're blasting off a crime in a minute in there.

860
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,560
You do hear two excited teens saying like,

861
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,040
that shark is really fucking the shit out of that other shark,

862
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,800
but you can't look at that

863
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,960
because you didn't pay to see this love act?

864
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,680
What if you like, do you think that there's like,

865
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,480
I don't know, like a hundred workers

866
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,400
who are just waiting to see if you look up

867
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,480
so they can charge you like,

868
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,280
you look to the shark fuck, that's $20.

869
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,240
Yeah, gotcha.

870
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,960
Yeah, 20 New Zealand dollars too.

871
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,080
Who knows how much that is?

872
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,720
Nobody.

873
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,560
Here's the thing, here's the good news about it.

874
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,000
If you head over to the Picton Cinemas at 10.15 AM

875
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,800
to 45 PM or 7.15 PM

876
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,360
and get comfy for the next two hours and 14 minutes

877
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,320
because you are going to be able to pay one price

878
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,240
to see all the crimes of Grindelwald

879
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,080
and then when you get bored, you go over to the aquarium.

880
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,320
You got them both there in one

881
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,280
and you can book online too, which is huge.

882
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,400
But why would you get bored

883
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,080
while watching the crimes of Gumbelbar?

884
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,320
Is this the exact building that you, did you find it?

885
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,640
Yeah, I've traced it to the Picton Cinemas.

886
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,360
Do you think that there's another cinema in town

887
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,680
that their tagline is, we don't have any fish.

888
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
Don't be tempted by these rad fish.

889
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,480
You don't have to pay for it.

890
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,720
We're just Grindelwald over here.

891
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,520
Oh, I said it right.

892
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,120
No, you set him free, shoot.

893
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,160
Now he's out there.

894
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,520
I don't understand.

895
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,800
Why is anyone coming to the movies?

896
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,360
I've got it.

897
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,680
And they just go and like buy a betta fish

898
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,840
and like a little like, you know, bowl

899
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,400
and they just put it on the concessions counter

900
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,200
to try to try it.

901
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,560
Don't look at the bowl though.

902
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,040
Don't look at the bowl unless you pay me a dollar.

903
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,280
But it's right next to the popcorn spray.

904
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,040
Nope, nope, no.

905
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,000
Eyes down, piss, eyes down, don't linger.

906
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,960
Eyes down, piss somewhere.

907
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,000
That's my bowl.

908
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,160
Don't linger.

909
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,920
What if all aquariums did this

910
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,200
and they were like, come on in,

911
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,680
you can use our space for a birthday party or whatever.

912
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,160
If you look at one fish, so help me God.

913
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,160
And then it's like a fun game.

914
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,720
We should do that.

915
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
We go to aquariums every time we travel

916
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,800
because I don't know, we're big marine life fans, I guess.

917
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,680
Next time I go in, I'll pay the admission price

918
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
and see how long I can go without looking at

919
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,240
one sort of aquatic creature that God made for us

920
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,360
to enjoy in the ocean.

921
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,320
Because I bet I can't go very long.

922
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,600
No, they're right there.

923
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,480
It's so tempting.

924
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,920
Who could say no to that?

925
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,360
I could do it for all the boring fish

926
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,720
except for the one big window,

927
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,360
which is the only cool part of the fish part of the aquarium.

928
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,520
But then as soon as I get to Penguin Town,

929
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,560
that's the ball game because I gotta see these guys.

930
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,000
What are they up to?

931
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,480
It's weird the sort of like, you go to the aquarium

932
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
and it's weird how quickly you go from like,

933
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
oh man, this is amazing to like,

934
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,960
what do I care?

935
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,320
It's just another tank full of fish.

936
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,320
Wake me up when you got something better.

937
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Oh, it's swimming.

938
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,480
Swimming, big deal.

939
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,960
My ideal aquarium, it is all those walkway tunnels

940
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,800
where you're inside because you can make believe

941
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
that you're the fish now

942
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
and you can do some light limpet play

943
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
and then you do get into one big room

944
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,160
with like the big panel that's open into the ocean

945
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,120
and then there's a quick funnel cake break

946
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,120
and then you're this Penguin Town baby

947
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,480
and the penguins will see you out.

948
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,480
I would like one room where it's just like thigh-high water

949
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
that you actually wade through to get to the other side.

950
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,480
Okay.

951
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,400
Yeah, you're wet for the rest of it,

952
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,600
but like also, listen, I spend all day in the aquarium

953
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,040
and I'm looking at fish in water

954
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
and I'm like, I'm here in the stupid air.

955
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah.

956
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,320
I wanna be in water.

957
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,800
I'll tell you what I also need in my idealized aquarium

958
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,560
is that at any point during this like very linear pathway,

959
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,080
there can be like a little offshoot hall

960
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,520
that you can, and the hall is like three quarters of a mile long

961
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,680
and then at the end of that is like the petting place

962
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,160
because I don't want to see, smell, experience that in any way

963
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,080
without giving my explicit consent

964
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,920
by making the long journey to it

965
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,000
because that part of the aquarium always makes me quite sad.

966
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
The horseshoe crabs don't wanna be touched there, Richard.

967
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,920
And they smell not great.

968
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,080
So like, I'm trying not to be mad at the horseshoe crabs

969
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,880
for their bad smell

970
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
because I know they're not going through a great time either

971
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
what with all of their Richard touching.

972
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,320
I would say if I worked at an aquarium,

973
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,080
I would take special care, well, of the fish,

974
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,560
but also like whenever I'm making the little plaques

975
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,200
that go next to the tanks,

976
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,400
I would add some like fun details in there

977
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
that maybe aren't super true,

978
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,560
but I've also been to lots of aquariums

979
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,600
and I've never seen a human being read those plaques before.

980
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Absolutely not.

981
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,880
Tell me about this fish.

982
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,400
This blue, it's got a stripe

983
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
and it's about the size of my hand.

984
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,520
Yep.

985
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,320
I'm good to go.

986
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,080
I figured that one out on my own.

987
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,000
I would add into the plaque something like,

988
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and if you listen really closely,

989
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,520
you could hear it speak English

990
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,280
and then just like watch people like lean into the glass

991
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,160
like, what, really?

992
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,600
I mean, that panel could just say like,

993
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,480
hey, shithead, you're a piece of garbage.

994
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,840
You're an idiot because you're not,

995
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,600
I bet you're not going to ever read this.

996
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,960
Oh, we can combine two bits from this episode.

997
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,880
Let me pick which fish I want to eat

998
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,240
as I walk through the aquarium.

999
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,720
To the restaurant.

1000
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
No, I think you got to catch it.

1001
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,280
I think it's up to you to catch it.

1002
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,040
Well, I mean, this is an aquarium, right?

1003
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,080
So you can pay more for, you know, a tool of some sort.

1004
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,440
Would that change the way you feel

1005
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,960
about the petting area, Griffin?

1006
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,120
If you just reached in, picked up a starfish

1007
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,560
and then threw it in a deep fryer.

1008
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,080
Only if I, I would not feel comfortable doing that

1009
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,600
because he would be flopping in a way

1010
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,280
that would sort of mean like,

1011
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,760
it's time, it's not my time to die, Griffin.

1012
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,120
But I will say what's going to get me over the hump

1013
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,480
is if there is, and this could be like a person in costume

1014
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,680
or maybe just the actual guy made flesh,

1015
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,600
but the chef from Little Mermaid,

1016
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,000
who's singing his great song about killing all the animals.

1017
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,400
Yeah, him, if he's doing it,

1018
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,800
then I feel like I would get into the spirit

1019
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,640
of his fun sort of murder song.

1020
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,440
And I would throw this,

1021
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
I'd plop the swordfish right down in that hot bath.

1022
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,280
Yeah, and you know what?

1023
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,040
Maybe like, maybe ease my morals a little bit

1024
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,720
and tell me that like all the fish

1025
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,640
in this room are super old.

1026
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,760
That could be good.

1027
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,280
Or maybe they're all jerks.

1028
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
Maybe there's another long tunnel

1029
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,480
that the fish can swim through

1030
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,000
and it's a one-way trip and it ends in the fish kitchen.

1031
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,800
And then they know,

1032
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,360
I've had a lot of fun entertaining children.

1033
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,360
I've seen a lot of noses pressed up to glass.

1034
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,960
I'm ready.

1035
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,400
It's time to make the donuts.

1036
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
And it's time to make me donuts.

1037
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,960
And then they know, and it can be fun.

1038
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,920
There can be like,

1039
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
and then they can play music on the tunnel

1040
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,000
and they can have pictures of their friends

1041
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,280
and kids on the tunnel.

1042
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
That's nice, like an elephant graveyard kind of thing.

1043
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
It's like the end of Big Fish,

1044
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
which is great and appropriate.

1045
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,360
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week.

1046
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Thank you so much for joining us.

1047
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,640
We always love having you here.

1048
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,560
And we...

1049
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,600
I also wanna say thank you to J.K. Rowling

1050
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,040
for paying for this sponsored episode.

1051
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,920
We should have mentioned that,

1052
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,240
but like your support means a lot.

1053
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,120
Yeah, we've done sponsored episodes in the past,

1054
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,040
but none where we've explicitly said

1055
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,600
not to patronize the product

1056
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,920
that has given us money to sponsor it.

1057
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,160
So this is a unique way of doing things.

1058
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,680
And thank you, J.K. for the support.

1059
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,080
We also wanna say thanks to Maximum Fun Network

1060
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,200
for having us as a part of their extended podcasting family.

1061
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,120
We have a newsletter you can sign up for

1062
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,480
at bit.ly forward slash McElroy Mail.

1063
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
It's not a pyramid scheme, which is really important.

1064
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,600
A lot of people have asked us about that,

1065
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,840
and it's not, we're not sure who keeps saying that.

1066
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,200
We've seen buzzings about it in the blogosphere.

1067
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,000
Not a pyramid scheme.

1068
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,920
It is not a pyramid scheme.

1069
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,840
Oh, hey, we will have another episode

1070
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,920
of our annual eternal podcast.

1071
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,360
Son of a gun.

1072
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,040
Till death do us blart

1073
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,720
will arrive on American Thanksgiving

1074
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,000
as it has every year

1075
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,880
and will continue to until the end of linear time.

1076
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,680
It will be the fourth episode of the show,

1077
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,360
which means that we're going to be watching

1078
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,120
the film Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

1079
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,560
with our friends Tim and Guy.

1080
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,080
Y'all, I bought it on Blu-ray this year.

1081
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,040
I'm excited.

1082
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm still renting it.

1083
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,880
Straight up, Guy is in India.

1084
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,120
I have no idea how we're gonna get all this together,

1085
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,000
but it will be there on Thanksgiving Day

1086
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,360
and we hope you enjoy it.

1087
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,800
Till death do us blart is the name of that.

1088
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,760
I didn't give the hard plug.

1089
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,120
Till death do us blart.

1090
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,640

Yeah, let's see.

1093
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,120
What else?

1094
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,640
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1095
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,520
for these four theme songs.

1096
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,480
It's a departure off the album,

1097
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,360
putting the days to bed.

1098
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,320
Great album, great song, great dude, great vibes.

1099
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,360

1101

Let's wrap it up.

1103
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,920
Wrap it up.

1104
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,560
That's it.

1105
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,040
We're good.

1106
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,960
You're the one who does it though.

1107
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,000
So like, what are you waiting?

1108
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So here's a final Yahoo.

1109
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,600

1110
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,160
Thank you, Bree.

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,560
It's Yahoo Answers user Sierra.

1112
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,360

It's been my brother, my brother and me.

Hey Kyra, so Max Funcon tickets go on sale

this Friday, November 23rd at 11am Pacific

1125
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,160
and I'm trying to write a promo.

1126
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,880
Okay, so what do they need to know to look forward to?

1127
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,560
Inspiring classes.

Making new friends.

1132
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,200
Don't forget about the dance party.

1133
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,240
Oh, and it all takes place on a beautiful mountaintop.

1134
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,920
Okay, got it.

1135
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,880
Anything else?

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,320
Well, if we missed anything,

I think that went really well.

1140
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:42,880
Yeah, that sounded good.
