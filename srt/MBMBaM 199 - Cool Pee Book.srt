1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:48,640
Welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,120
May the fourth be with you. Set those phasers to stun. Let's talk about the Kentucky Derby.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm Justin McElroy. Wow. A lot going on in that one. Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,920
Yeah, I guess this is all of it then. I think the creation of Star Wars Day was so that the nerds

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,600
would be so hung over from whatever it is nerds drink like grog. Klingon Ale. Klingon Ale that

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,600
they wouldn't be able to participate in Cinco de Mayo and they'd leave that for all the regular

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,480
people. Holy shit. OK, I know that you were saying you were having trouble finding like the line of

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,520
the winners, but I found just like lineup of the racers. I don't know what position they came in,

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,320
but here's a couple just really choice. Let me hit first off. Let's hit the big three. Yesterday was

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,800
Derby Day. It's our Super Bowl. It's our prom. It's our quinceanera. Kentucky Derby is the highlight.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,840
It was my bris. It was my bris. It is basically the highlight of my entire year and one of these

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,600
years I do plan to get around to watching it. But number one, top of the pops, California Chrome.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Boom. Got that Kentucky Gold. California Chrome. That is a command. That's probably the most

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,360
commanding like it's the most baller name. I think the most commanding name is commanding curve,

19
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,400
which was the second place horse, which is, of course, place. I think is that they placed.

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,160
He placed. He placed. Here's some other. Uncle Psy was one of them. S I G H. Vickers in trouble.

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:44,000
Which I really liked. Danza. Danza was number three. He showed. Nice, Danza. General A-Rod.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
Danzig. They had some fun with it. I mean, they always have fun with the names,

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,960
but there's a lot of homages this year and opportunity. Oh, boy. I like that one. Intense

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:04,320
holiday. I tell you who I'm disappointed to not see on this list. Orb. That would be Orb. I do

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,640
believe we have Orb joining us via teleconference. Hello, Orb. Are you there? Orb is here in your

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,080
primitive earth conference. Orb, I hear that you've retired from the racing scene and you're

27
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,240
just down and dirty full time stuff. Orb has retired from his physical form. You went now.

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,760
Hold on. Yeah, I was under the impression that you've been put out to stud that you're making

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,760
loved lots of beautiful lady horses. Orb entered as many lady horses as exist in the world.

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,760
Having fulfilled all lady horses in the world, he transcended to join the great consciousness

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,600
in the sky. Are you telling me that never again will a horse be born that does not contain a

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:53,280
strain of orb? Orb is all. Did you leave our earth human woman unsullied at least? Half of them.

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,680
Okay. I can't tell you guys how happy it makes me that yesterday we got no less than 700 tweets.

34
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,040
Like, guys, it's happening. There's horses. There's horses and they're mainstream. It's just so nice

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,440
to know that you guys think of us whenever you see any equine activity. There are many worse

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,440
associations you could have. Yeah. Nobody texts us when like Ghostbusters is on. Like, hey guys,

37
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Ghostbusters or Cake Boss for that matter. Yeah. Which I wish you would because I keep missing it.

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah. When is it on? I don't know. 712 AM on JMC. It's like AMC, but- Speaking of AMC,

39
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,880
I woke up at six in the morning with my wife who had to go to work very early. And what was playing

40
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,840
on AMC was Mad Men. Can you think of anything you are less equipped for at six o'clock in the

41
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,680
morning than watching Mad Men? What audience are they trying to reach with these very early,

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,520
like, kids pulling up some Cap'n Crunch to get their Don Drake- Quiet, Mom! I gotta find out

43
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,280
what's up in the ad world. You get back in the kitchen, I'm gonna punch you in the vagina like

44
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,960
they do on Mad Men the show. I've only seen like four episodes of Mad Men. Fair enough. But I hear

45
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,000
everyone says like, I fell off in like season three because just the way they treated women

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
just got to be too much. So I assume like the three episodes in season one I watched were

47
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,760
pretty goddamn brutal in that respect. So I do assume that at a certain point fucking Jon Hamm

48
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:39,840
just like gives ladies just the old hoochie haymaker. That is basically what the show has

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,600
devolved into. He's now in like a lengthy court battle where he's trying to assert that he had

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,680
an identical twin named Bob Braper that was going around actually punching all the vaginas. It's a

51
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,480
class action lawsuit of Jon Hamm versus a thousand women. And he had to hire the attorneys that

52
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,720
defended the cigarette industry and it's like whoa circular back on itself times a flat circle.

53
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah. Did you guys introduce yourselves? I said I'm Justin Matthews. We did. We should just start

54
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,360
like doing the show. Oh let's just do the show then, right? Sure. Cool. It's episode 199. Well

55
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,640
fuck what are we doing? Oh should we? I mean we had this idea for two hundo. It's nothing big.

56
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,640
Um we'll we'll plan something big for three hundo or four hundo. Maybe even five. Why don't we have

57
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,480
five hundo? Yeah say five hundo. We'll plan on something big. We'll do something big for five

58
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,120
hundo. Um but I think we did this before if if we ever gave you advice and you did shit with it

59
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,080
first of all shame on you. Shame on you. Listen to this claim right at the beginning. You're not

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
supposed to do that but if you did um I don't know it might be fun to hear from you so why

61
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
don't you drop us a line let us know how that how that worked out. Yeah give us the follow-up email.

62
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
But look episode 200 follow-up in the subject lines we know that it's from you and let us know

63
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,960
how it worked out and please let us know like what your fake ass name was. Anyway let's help some

64
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,280
new people. 199 episodes. That's disgusting. I can't believe it. Fuck this.

65
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
Fuck you. Fuck all this. And you know what I'm out. And you people were angry that we were late

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
last week like seriously um and I saw a lot of tweets are like McElroy brothers late again.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,320
We made 199 goddamn free as a bird episodes for you. How could you? Also we love you. Thank you

68
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,840
for listening. Thank you so much for listening. It's a dream. We really love you. You're really

69
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,200
special to us. Fuck you though for real. Fuck you though honestly. You gotta neg them. You gotta

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,800
pause them. You gotta draw them back in. When my husband and I go out to eat I usually have food.

71
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,400
We are robots. We get oil. Usually I have food leftover and I take it home with me.

72
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,480
I will either eat it for dinner or for lunch the next day. Okay if there's any left. There's a lot

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,040
of detail in here that I probably could have presupposed but let's continue. My husband always

74
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,400
finishes his meal and will partake of my leftovers at home if it the if it's food he likes. Did you

75
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,880
say ex-husband? This irritates me but he thinks there is no problem. Bros how should I handle

76
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,960
this issue? That's from sometimes starved in California. It is the only thing. It is the only

77
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,280
non-micasasucasa thing that happens when you get married. They should start fucking penciling this

78
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,200
in to the vows of every single like you know that like the placeholder vows for people who are too

79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,800
lazy to write their own. Right. Like that should be in there like for sickness and health. If I'm

80
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,760
sick or poor you gotta stick with it. Everything that's mine is yours except for my goddamn

81
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:55,280
leftovers that I brought home from Chili's last night. I have found that I do not I don't do

82
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,360
leftovers really. I don't enjoy leftovers. I order food extra to have leftovers. That's the Travis

83
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,120
McElroy special. That's called that's called doubles and my wife won't let me do it anymore.

84
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,160
So I can't do that. I can only have half eaten. I tried to explain to her that if I have an

85
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:22,400
untouched meal in the fridge that's cool but if it's like half eaten and I have like my gross

86
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,560
yesterday bites or my mouth was yesterday I can't. Hold up. You're saying if your mouth

87
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
if your mouth has already hold on because the implications of this are enormous. You're saying

88
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,160
if your mouth if your mouth has touched a food item before you are no longer interested in putting

89
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,160
your mouth on it again you're a self-germaphobe. Do you just like order 10 burgers when you go to

90
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,600
Chili's every day and you take a bite of each one and my life day to day is basically like a

91
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Natasha Bedingfield song. I'm evolving, changing, feeling the rain on my skin, growing. That person

92
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,760
I was yesterday has nothing to do with the new more enlightened Justin you find this current day.

93
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't know what that guy was into. I don't know. Maybe he you know maybe he liked more

94
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
pepper than I do. I have no way of knowing and it looks sloppy. You look at it. It does. It never

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,720
looks great. It never looks the way it used to. If you just put it direct in the fridge because you

96
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,680
got doubles though then it's fine because it looks like a fresh meal that you're just heating up.

97
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,520
That's fine. That's fine. Now sometimes what I will do is I'll eat half like if it's something

98
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:37,360
that okay if it's something that has an exact half let's say a sandwich okay if a sandwich or perhaps

99
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,840
a pizza that has an exact half that doesn't have sloppy bites out of it then that is fine because

100
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,760
that is like oh I guess I got I only wanted half of this yesterday but I haven't touched this so

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
it is not a whole. Do you understand what I'm saying? It is a whole. It was at one time a half but it could

102
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,440
pass as a whole so now I can reheat my leftovers. I actually have a similar thing. I always catch

103
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,680
myself because I love leftovers but like if I go to a place and get a burger we've discussed before

104
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,240
that fries are so bad the next day but like doing a burger and fries I will fill up my box with all

105
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,760
the other stuff on the plate that I know I'm not gonna eat and then there will just be like a

106
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,160
styrofoam coffin in our fridge for like weeks. I saw a crazy way of reheating fries that apparently

107
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,960
is the best. You throw them all in a waffle iron and close it and it turns into a giant waffle fry

108
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,520
that is crisp and delicious. That's not really how waffle iron works. You can't really just

109
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,720
throw a tennis ball in there. Now that's a waffle ball but it has to be a very specific type of

110
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,920
thing. You fold it in half piece of pizza and then you waffle iron it and it apparently is like

111
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,320
waffle pizza and it's delicious. That's what I hear. It's not waffle pizza. It's burning pizza

112
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,120
with squares on it. It's fucked up. It's fucked up. You broke that pizza. I'm happy with my wife

113
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
eating my leftovers because more important to me than eating my leftovers is fridge space which is

114
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,760
always at a premium especially once we start to eat vegetables which are like the pushy layabouts

115
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,360
of the fridge world. The awkward corner uneven. Doesn't lay flat. Nothing stacks on top of broccoli.

116
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Not really coming out that often. Not as often as like the pizza sauce or the mustard. They're just

117
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,040
kind of like in there showing off. Look at me. You have celery in your refrigerator. How are you?

118
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,840
How exotic. How exotic. What a big healthy boy. Is that a mango I spy? If Huntington's only vegan

119
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:37,280
stops by he'll be so impressed. Can you get food that your husband doesn't like? It's just you

120
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,880
shouldn't have. You shouldn't have to. This is crazy. If I did this to Rachel she wouldn't leave

121
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,240
me but she would punch out a number in a card that if it fills up 10 times then she'll leave me.

122
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,720
I get 10. I get 10 every time I eat one of Rachel's leftovers. I have to keep in mind like

123
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,480
what am I at? Six? Is this worth it? Yeah. It is. I do want the rest of that Jack Daniels

124
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Bourbon Street steak. Yeah I will take that because we only eat at Applebee's. What the

125
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,240
fuck are you talking about? Sometimes you eat at Applebee's. I haven't eaten at non-Applebee's.

126
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,520
Regardless of what Friday Night Lights will try and tell you I have not seen a single Applebee's

127
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,280
here in Austin, Texas. Teresa and I do this. We eat each other's leftovers but it always goes like

128
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,400
this. Hey are you really gonna eat this? No I'm not. Go for it. Because like we'll both take home

129
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,320
stuff so as not to feel wasteful even if we didn't enjoy the meal. Even if it wasn't our jam and then

130
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,440
the other person eats it. I'm shocked to hear that Justin you're not in on this game because

131
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,720
as people who work from home for an hour out of your day your lunch hour you get a brief respite

132
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,560
from being inside your house and instead you're whisked away to a private Chili's booth and the

133
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
courtesy of your own living room where you can watch last night's Game of Thrones and eat half

134
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,960
a quesadilla. Like that's my goddamn jam. Oh you mean that for one day I don't have to eat a white

135
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,720
garlic chicken pizza hot pocket and I can pretend that I'm at Chili's again? Whoosh hop on my flying

136
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,840
carpet that's also half a quesadilla and come with me to your private Game of Thrones booth.

137
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:30,400
You get to play restaurant. No you don't you get to play Chili's. It's a very different experience.

138
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,880
I like to play Logan's Roadhouse because I can throw peanut shells everywhere. Yeah. And that is

139
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,680
really luxurious. I would love to see your your floor covered with peanut shells while your cats

140
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,320
walk around distastefully like oh they would not enjoy. How about a yahoo? Did we help at all?

141
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Nope. No but I mean your handle I mean I think the 10 10 punch card system is good. Yeah that

142
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,760
seems good. Um this yahoo was sent in by Carrie H Bennett. Thank you Carrie. Uh this fucking yahoo

143
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,840
goddamn shit ass answers account has been suspended which is good I guess because back in the day like

144
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,480
if you suspended somebody's account all of their input on yahoo answers just vanished which is like

145
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,320
haunting right? Like think of all of the goddamn information that would just vanish from the earth.

146
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,240
All of the advice all the help. Oh I'm sure the FBI still has that information saved somewhere.

147
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,600
Yeah PRISM. It's in PRISM somewhere. PRISM's not going to share that shit though. Um boy I'm glad

148
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,240
we got through that without Snowden popping up. Uh so this suspended user asks. Excuse me?

149
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,000
Nope. God damn it. Did you need me for a question about intelligence? No we actually need Justin back.

150
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,680
I he's now he's busy. There is no Justin only Snowden. We're splitting leftovers.

151
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:52,800
Um this suspended user asks. Leftover secrets. Okay. I told him half then he told me half.

152
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:02,320
They're split secrets. All right here we go on with the show this suspended user asks.

153
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,760
You guys didn't see that but I was drinking a glass of water the entire time. Yeah it's

154
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:14,320
very impressive. It's hugely impressive. Horse related baby names. Does anyone know some horse

155
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,600
related male baby names? The only thing I can come up with is Colt. See I was gonna say Winnie

156
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:32,240
but if it has to be for a boy. Win? Um uh. So isn't that the guy the guy from Arcade Fire is named Win I think?

157
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,880
That could be shit for Winnie. How about Hoofster? Hoofster's not a name. I think they're looking for actual names.

158
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,640
Main man. Okay that's a nickname. So you're just saying horse parts. Legs. Shoulders. Haunches.

159
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,040
Haunches. I call them haunch. Haunch that's okay. I think I could put that slide as a name.

160
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,320
Um I'm gonna throw I'm gonna throw some name spaghetti at the wall. Well to be clear this is

161
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:07,840
name spaghetti that was crafted artisanally in the Yahoo Answers bistro. Um Katie responded and said

162
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,120
Derby. Uh that's apparently America's most favorite favorite famous horse. Is that true? No. I don't

163
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,880
think no. I feel that there was a word left out of there. There's the right there's right horse race

164
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,960
probably. Um Philippe which is a variant of Philip which is apparently Greek for lover of horses.

165
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:38,160
Again I have to question whether that's true. Uh Garone. A Garone or Garan? G-A-R-R-A-N is a type of

166
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,600
horse. Is that right? Yeah but it's also not a type of name. Hippolyte. No. I guess. Come on.

167
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,480
Horsley. God forbid that child is fat. Sorry wait Horsley? Horsley which is apparently a horse a

168
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,600
horse meadow it's called a Horsley. Um Marshall caretaker of horses. That's okay okay yeah. Sort

169
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,680
of horse horse adjacent. Yeah. Uh Nashua also the name of a famous horse race that won a famous race

170
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,800
horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1955. Man back in 1955 they didn't know what the fuck they

171
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,560
were doing. What am I going to call this horse? Nashua. This one's name is Charles. Now this one's

172
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,200
name is grandfather sock drawer. Oh weirdo get out of here. Get out of here. This fucking guy

173
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,760
with his weird name. Come back with a grown-up name. Um here's an awesome horse name. Are you

174
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:38,560
ready for this? Yeah. Style. No no hear me out it's from uh uh Piers Anthony series and the main

175
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,680
character s t i l e. It's a fucking awesome name. Yeah it's not at all but what would the last name

176
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,280
be? Give me a last name that style works with without sounding like a porn star. Shades guy.

177
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:59,760
Style shades. Hi I'm style guy and this is my dick. You're checking out my dick on the porn internet because

178
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,960

179
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Stoddard's pretty good. Hey but yeah but like what's the last name? That's the thing you gotta

180
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,920
think of like it's Stoddard Johnson. Nope that's that internet porn star. How about Horace?

181
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:28,720
That sounds kind of like horse. Okay uh then Colter Colton great Bronco that's not gonna work for a child.

182
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,880
Oh no unless he's giant. Colton i n apostrophe is another option. Colton. Colton. Hi I'm Colton style

188
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:30,000
welcome to Jutland mail pornography website on the internet. Boys only boys only hang up the

189
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:42,160
phone mom I've got a web connection here. Oh man. Why do people want to name their baby with a horse

190
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,800
thing? Why can't it be a baby thing that and give him a horse later? I didn't follow that sentence

191
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,600
at all Justin. Give him a horse later like a real horse like hey. Don't give him a horse name like

192
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
if you want him to have a spiritual connection to horses just get him a horse if you're so big into

193
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,080
horses. Or just tattoo him early on. Oh listen horses are expensive names are free. That's true

194
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,920
names are free. Um how about just naming him horse lover? What about ed? What about oats?

195
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't like that. That worked for for Holland.

196
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,240
That was a terrible joke that wasn't the name of the man. I'm glad that you said it though

197
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,280
because I was about to. It was two men and his name was Darryl. What about Darryl? What about

198
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,760
Darryl? Darryl Oats style guy. This is what I would love if the person named their kid something

199
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,720
that had to be explained over four steps like I named him Darryl because I love horses. I don't

200
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,760
follow Darryl like Darryl Oats like oats like horses eat because I love horses. I'm gonna go.

201
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,720
I'm sorry you wasted your time. I named my son Shrek. Why did you name your son Shrek? Because

202
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,000
Shrek loved Fiona in in the movie Shrek and Fiona apple and what horses love apples so Shrek. Kevin

203
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,360
Bacon. You could also just say like Shrek had was friends with a donkey and a donkey's like a horse.

204
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:14,160
No no you can't say that. That is not the logic chain I used. Donkeys are horses with attitude

205
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,560
problems. I recently signed a deal to publish my first novel but there's a problem. My book contains

206
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:29,200
a fair share of graphic sexual content. Yes it does. What should I tell my family when they

207
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,080
inevitably ask to sample some of my work or should I just not tell them about the book at all? I don't

208
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,320
want my family to associate me with the golden showers and butt loving. Man I hope you bring

209
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:53,520
that kind of erotic lingual ability to your novel. Come come over here you giant stud and give me some

210
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:02,000
butt loving. Give me some of that funky butt loving. Give me some funky butt loving and then maybe

211
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,840
maybe we'll make water. That was so erotic that my chair broke behind me.

212
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,400
Come on over here and join team whoopee. We're about to make some. We're gonna get down and dirty

213
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:27,360
and have some sex. Get ready for some sex team whoopee. Grab my jello jigglers. Um jello? Jello

214
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:35,440
jigglers. Um that was from excessively erotic in east bay. If your family asks to read it just say

215
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,080
like have you ever read game of thrones and it's like oh no it's way too filthy and way too like

216
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,280
okay cool I didn't get published I lied. I didn't get published I just have money I have a source

217
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:57,520
of income now from um. I'm a jiggalo. A jello jiggalo. I'm a jello jiggalo. Um listen water sports

218
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:05,200
though in your book. I don't really that's not like my thing and like we've learned to become

219
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,560
very accepting and stuff. I just it just because he wrote it like George R.R. Martin isn't necessarily

220
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,640
into like fisting and incest. But he is. I mean he is but I'm saying not necessarily like sure

221
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,800
somebody else wrote. I'm not saying this person's into it I'm just saying how how how does that act

222
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:33,520
this will be a fun little exercise how does the act of romantic water sports translate to the

223
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:43,440
written word. I imagine there's a lot of a lot of uh release a lot of use of the word release.

224
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Like golden teardrops falling from the ceiling his pee pee filled the air.

225
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,720
Pee pee on me Daniel pee pee right on me. But then it progresses the plot because then she

226
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,360
becomes worried that he's too dehydrated and he won't be able to complete the battle the next day.

227
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,840
She just got stung by a jellyfish. I haven't read the book. You can just plan to follow whatever

228
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:16,720
pact of like uh ignorance or perhaps avoidance that we are apparently practicing with our noni

229
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,040
who we've been told on several occasions listened to our program but has never felt obligated to

230
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,640
bring up some of our more ribald material in polite company. Just hope for that really sweet

231
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,120
unspoken agreement where you know that they know they know but nobody mentions it. That's a great

232
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,520
that's that's exactly it they will know that you wrote a pee pee butt loving book but they're not

233
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,720
gonna say that to you because they can't handle that conversation nor do they want to seek it

234
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,240
out with it. Or unless unless they read it and they come back and they're like that was fucking

235
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,560
awesome. That was a I loved your pee pee. Daniel your pee pee book was incredible. I couldn't put

236
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,360
it down. This is some hot shit. This is some oh man I was boned out for days. I didn't know that

237
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,720
listen we pee on each other all the time now because your book was so good. Your uncle Ralph

238
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:21,040
twibbed my acorn till it was raw. We loved it. Couldn't couldn't get enough. Daniel thank you for

239
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,320
freeing me and opening me up to pee pee. And thank you uncle Ralph for opening me up repeatedly

240
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,080
during the reading of it during our stage readings of your dirty pee pee book.

241
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:44,480
Great great job Dan. How much money did you make on this book? Enough? Enough to justify this

242
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,560
thing you did to us? This thing you did to the whole world? This just in CNN breaking news

243
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,640
everyone's peeing on each other. Good work Daniel. I'm Wolf Blitzer. That's him getting peed on.

244
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,520
Wolf listen I hate to bring you into the office like this. It's always awkward. You've got to stop.

245
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,080
You've got to stop getting blasted by pee. You've got to wait for the breaks.

246
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,200
But you have regular breaks. We have a core message here at CNN and it's about constantly

247
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,960
covering missing forms of transportation. Your message of someone get in here and pee on Wolf

248
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,560
Blitzer. Also we have to talk about the way you changed the title of your program to someone get

249
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,120
in here and pee on Wolf Blitzer. We need you to stop using the hologram machine to generate

250
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,960
holograms of dead celebrities that you pee on or pee through. Really? Really. You pretend it's all

251
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,040
over them. But you can keep the butt loving segment. That has gotten really high ratings.

252
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,720
That's gotten great ratings. Welcome to the Pissuation Room. Oh boy.

253
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,040
Crossfire. You don't even have to change it. You don't have to change any of the titles.

254
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:12,640
Anderson Cooper P60. There it is. I found it eventually. My fiance and I have a very similar

255
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,800
taste in television shows and pretty much watch all the same shows together. Only exception is

256
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,160
Game of Thrones, which I've been watching since it first aired. He's historically been indifferent

257
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,600
towards the show, but recently started watching at a convenience since it's Sunday night. There

258
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,200
are only so many sofas to sit on in our house. Anyway, now when we watch, he asks questions

259
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,080
throughout the whole show. Who's that? What are they fighting over? Are their two blonde siblings

260
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,080
flirting? Where did the dragons come from? It's a huge annoyance. I don't want to tell him to shut

261
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,640
up and binge watch the first couple of seasons so he can be caught up. He doesn't actually have

262
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
enough interest to watch the previous episodes, but I can't take all the distractions during each

263
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,440
episode now. Help! Man, I've watched that show since the beginning and I absolutely wish there

264
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,120
was a person in the room that I could do that to. Yeah. I just watched episode four, season four,

265
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,320
and felt I had missed like three episodes. It's like, hold on. Where is the, what is the,

266
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,400
just have him read a synopsis like on Wikipedia. This is the problem though with those because I

267
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,240
tried to do that. If I can't place a person, if I'm who's this guy, you go to a synopsis on

268
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,640
Wikipedia except it's based on the character of the books. So you read one sentence too far and

269
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,560
it's like, and then he transforms into Iron Man and kills everybody. Sorry, spoiler alert,

270
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,400
meant to mention earlier. And you know, if nothing else, before you start the next episode,

271
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,400
make dinner. You guys sit down and have dinner. And as you're eating dinner, just run through

272
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,920
like, so here's where we're at now. And kind of give him a rundown as you understand it.

273
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,560
So then he's caught up with where you are watching the show or watch it twice. You could watch it

274
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,920
twice once as sort of like walking him through it and once to just like for yourself. Yeah.

275
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,440
Cause Teresa on far less confusing shows, she and I have done that like a doctor who was one where

276
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,320
like, you know, she started with me in the Matt Smith era. So I gave her a rundown of everything

277
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,840
that had come before that. And, and, you know, now she goes back and watches the other episodes,

278
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,280
but that way she could still watch it with me when it came on. And it was an experience we

279
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,400
shared together. You do it. Rachel and I did, cause I read the books and then I was pretty well

280
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,560
versed in it by the time the show came on. So I didn't find it super hard to follow, but it is,

281
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,080
it is an intimidating show. I mean, there's 800 characters. What you can do is watch that one

282
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,040
episode where the smoke monster from lost comes out of that girl's pussy. And then,

283
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:46,080
the other person will not want to watch the show anymore. Then it's not, then the show is just for

284
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,960
you at that point. Once the smoke monster from lost emerges from the womb and like,

285
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,160
it's kind of a weird cameo and also a weird thing to come out of that woman. Then they're just going

286
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:15,840
to, they're done fall off. No more dragon questions. Okay. Listen, let's go to the money zone. You

287
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:25,600
have to take care of your mom. Mother's day is coming up and you can say thank you with the most

288
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:34,720
beautiful gift of a hundred blooms and a free glass vase from proflowers.com for just $19.99.

289
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,200
Think about how much you fucked up. Just like today and this month and the past year and also

290
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,600
and how much you intend to fuck up in the future. You don't even have to be planning to fuck up.

291
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Just acknowledge the fact that you're going to fuck up and your mom's is going to like have to

292
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,240
deal with all of your shit. So this doesn't because you're the worst. You're the worst.

293
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,480
You're not the worst. It's just like how that's just life. You know, that's life. Everybody's

294
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,120
going to disappoint. Everyone's going to disappoint their moms. You're going to write a book about

295
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
water sports and she is going to have to go through. She is going to have to read it because

296
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
she's supportive and then she's going to have to look you in the eye at breakfast at brunch on

297
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,680
Easter next year. Here's even better. You can upgrade that. You get a hundred blooms with a

298
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,040
pink vase and chocolates for just $9.99 more. But you got to use the code my brother. Okay. You go

299
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,280
to proflowers.com and there's a blue microphone in the upper right hand corner. Click on it and type

300
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,600

301
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,840
ordered some flowers for Mother's Day for my brand new mother-in-law and I did not go with

302
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,000
the hundred blooms. I went with a different one and still entered the coupon code and still got

303
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,800
like money off. Wow. So still got a discount. Even. Special pro tip. Yeah. So we did that too

305
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
Luckily I know that Becky does not listen to this podcast. Linda, we are about to make it rain

306
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,160
sweet blooms from the sky, from the heavens. Wear these special glasses. They'll keep the blooms out

307
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,520
of your eyes. Uh, we have some proflowers that we got a hundred years ago and they still look

308
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,640
amazing. These are the greatest flowers you will ever have. Proflowers.com. Go to the blue microphone,

309
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,880
type in my brother. Don't let your mom down. Get her a hundred beautiful blooms. Um, you got to do

310
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,800
before Friday, this coming Friday, May 9th at midnight. Um, so, so pick them up today. Go now.

311
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,160
Go do it. Well, wait. Well, bye you fools. Do you guys know what I spent last night doing?

312
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,600
How many guys eating hot pockets and watching television? Uh, no. Nice try, but we made, uh,

313
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,200
chimichitos. So don't even trip on that. I don't think you said that word. Who's chimichitos? No,

314
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,960
chimichitos. It's a combination burrito chimichanga chimichitos. Uh, uh, they're delicious. I'll make

315
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,320
you guys. I've made them for you guys before. Actually. One of you has had chimichitos. I think

316
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,920
it was Travis. Remember the packets of tortilla with the chicken and salsa in the middle and

317
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,920
they were on enchilada sauce. Keep going. Okay. Uh, no, I spent the night watching the prophet

318
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,680
with, uh, Sydney, which is this really, really great, uh, show on CNBC. I know about a rich guy

319
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:36,400
Baptist who goes into your, um, failing business and then buys half of it and then takes it over

320
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,160
and calamity ensues. And it's our favorite thing right now. Uh, my man, Marcus Lemonis from the

321
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,720
prophet tweeted at me and Sydney last night for being such devoted fans. It was a highlight of

322
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,400
my year and I could only find those episodes. There was one place I could find them. That was

323
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,680
on Hulu Plus. That's the only place I could find those episodes. Okay. HuluPlus.com saved my goddamn

324
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,160
life. And they don't just have the prophet. They got a family guy, Parks and Rec, Tonight Show with

325
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Jimmy Fallon, Community, South Park, like every episode. Those are the shows they give us a list

326
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
of shows they want us to mention, including original stuff like the, uh, like Deadbeat,

327
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,920
the show about a pot smoking guy who talks to ghosts. Those are all great. There's also, uh,

328
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,640
every other show there's like, what do you want to watch? You want to watch Solitary?

329
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,000
Arguably the greatest reality TV show ever made. Do you want to watch like a hundred seasons,

330
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
back seasons of Survivor and the Amazing Race? I saw a preview on there for a show called Endgame

331
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,720
that I desperately want to check out. Endgame, the one about the, the chess master that solves crime?

332
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,200
Yes. Yeah, it is my jam. Okay, I'm going to check it out. And also they, they've got a movie coming

333
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,520
out on Hulu that's, uh, starring a friend of mine's son, uh, called Complete Works about this kid who

334
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,760
competes in a Shakespeare competition. It looks awesome. Go check out the preview. Uh, yeah. So

335
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,200
Hulu Plus, uh, is fantastic. Everybody loves it and we can get it to you for free. Normally it's

336
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,880
eight bucks a month, which is such a steal, but we can get you two full for free weeks, full access,

337
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,200
totally free. Go to hulu.com slash my brother. That's huluplus.com slash my brother and you can

338
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:25,760
get two free weeks of Hulu Plus. It is a steal and you will love it. Um, I have a special message

339
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:36,080
for Corin Bauer, uh, and the message is from husband. Husband says, happy birthday, honey.

340
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,560
This will probably reach you mid-May as I waited too long and these guys were booked up on personal

341
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,200
messages until then. Dog, you get 350 characters to explain yourself and you just spent half of it

342
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,160
explaining our scheduling issues. Uh, which is, I mean, it's fine. It's your time. Uh, early May

343
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,280
though. Thanks. Still knowing these guys, Emma Bim Bam, they never get around to doing personal

344
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,040
messages on time anyway. So who knows when this will reach you. It should have typed more running

345
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:14,000
out of root. Anyway, love y'all. There's nothing. There's literally nothing. Um, I know it's

346
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,480
Corin's birthday and she has husband and she has a husband whose name is, I'm not even gonna say

347
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,440
a husband. He may just be husband number one or husband number two and he does not have a gift

348
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,840
for concision, but he seems like a sweetheart. He seems like a real sweet, sweet guy. He was mean

349
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,760
to us twice. Really mean to us twice and wrong. Mean and wrong, which is a pretty great combination.

350
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,680
You mean wrong guy. Um, but thank you for letting us share this special moment with you. Happy

351
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,080
birthday to you, Corin. Happy birthday, Corin. You think Corin or Corin? Probably Corin, right?

352
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,800
Probably Corin. It's probably Corin. Happy birthday. Uh, any other birthday messages here? Oh,

353
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,240
I see one through my magic. What's that behind the cabinet? Oh, got a special message here for

354
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,160
Steven from Christine. Christine says, happy birthday, Steven. Sorry I can't be with you on

355
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,040
your birthday. I hope the message from the McElroy brothers warms your heart. Thank you for 8.5

356
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,800
wonderful years. Can't wait to make it official. Also, thanks for introducing me to these hilarious

357
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,680
brothers. They make the distance between us just a bit more bearable. Have a great day.

358
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
I'm Casey Kasem.

359
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,840
Hey husband, consider yourself on blast. Well, what you don't know about this, Griffin, is that

360
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:39,520
Christine and Steven have been together for 12 years, so that's on us. Thanks for 8.5 wonderful

361
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,600
years and 3.5 shitty ones. She requested this message the day we started this podcast, basically

362
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,680
200 episodes ago, and we literally did just find it behind the cabinet. Like, oh fuck, oh no,

363
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,760
it's covered in spiders and shit. But, uh, happy birthday, Steven. Happy birthday, Steven. For

364
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,680
real. You think Steven or- Happy birthday, Corinne. Stevin. Stefon?

365
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
Justin, what are you doing?

366
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,640
Uh, strapping a, uh, chicken in my arm. Heard there's some, uh, plague out west,

367
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,360
so I just wanted to, you know, kind of get out ahead of it.

368
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,720
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast,

369
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,280
Sawbones, where we talk about everything from trepanation to bloodletting, you would know that

370
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,840
that is a ridiculous idea, and it will never work.

371
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,280
Sawbones? I haven't caught it. Sawbones?

372
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,040
Yes, it's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network, and we record it together.

373
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,600
The doctor or something?

374
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,560
Yes.

375
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,800
Here's the best transition ever. Y'all want a Yahoo?

376
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Hit me.

377
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,840
Yes.

378
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:52,480
Uh, sent in by Sean Conrad. Sean, it's by Yahoo Answers user, where's my skew, who asks, do Steve

379
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,640
Urkel and Laura Winslow from Family Matters end up dating each other or getting married?

380
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,800
I know there was a Stefon whom Laura ended up almost marrying and who was played by Jaleel White,

381
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,440
but I'm talking about the Urkel character. Who, um, who played Stefon on Family Matters?

382
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,560
Hahaha. Do you mean Stefon Urkel?

383
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,360
Um, also, does anyone know Family Matters is on DVD? I checked Amazon,

384
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,280
but I only saw the first season was out. Ruster locked away in the goddamn ABC vault.

385
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,960
Let him out.

386
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,120
Let him out. Let those Family Matters out.

387
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,080
Free the Family Matters 5.

388
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:38,320
So I got this, and I was reading some of the responses, and I thought, oh,

389
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,160
this is Yahoo Answers users being crazy. For instance, Yahoo Answers user Korean Kid said,

390
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,240
Laura and Steve Urkel finally decided to get married, but Steve Urkel had to go out to space,

391
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,080
and then when they came back, everything was back to normal. So Steve and Laura got married,

392
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,000
and then they had sex. The end.

393
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,480
Uh-huh. That's fan fiction?

394
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,800
Yahoo Answers-

395
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,760
That's canon.

396
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Rachel says, uh, yes, they started dating at the end of the last season. Steve had proposed

397
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,080
to her, and she had accepted. In the series finale, Steve had to go to NASA for a bit,

398
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,120
and it just left you at where- Laura told Steve she will kiss him only on one condition. Steve

399
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:17,280
will have to promise to quote, never go into space again, and he says, only when we kiss Laura Lee,

400
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,080
only when we kiss, and that was it. Hey, that's kind of crazy, uh, kind of crazy,

401
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,600
basically slash fiction that Yahoo Answers is spinning. Fast forward 60 seconds after

402
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:36,240
some Google searching, that's actually how the motherfucking series Family Matters ends.

403
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,920
What?

404
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,200
Steve Urkel, in episode 214, goes into space. Episode 214, Lost in Space, part one,

405
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,120
goes into space because he wins a science contest, and NASA, I'm reading off the website

406
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,040
tvseriesfinale.com, says NASA decides to test its artificial gravity field invention on the shuttle

407
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,320
launch. They offer him the chance to become the first student astronaut. I don't know why NASA

408
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,560
was shut down, basically. He and Laura agree to postpone their wedding, so apparently they were

409
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,200
engaged. After six months of training, so covered a lot of ground this episode, Steve goes into

410
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,440
space. Things go wrong, and it looks like he'll be lost in space forever, but Steve cleverly comes

411
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,200
up with a way to save himself. Apparently fucking Eddie goes to the police academy. Harriet's

412
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,240
worried that Eddie's gonna get shot, and that's exactly what happens. He gets a gut shot while

413
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,920
serving as a meter maid, but he was, fortunately, he was wearing a bulletproof vest. What? That his,

414
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,960
that Carl Winslow gave him, and then Harriet says, okay, it's cool if you want to be a cop.

415
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,440
Steve comes back from space. Uh-huh. Laura says, I'll only kiss you if you never go to space again.

416
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,680
He says, I will only go to space when we kiss, or something like that, and that's how fucking

417
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:55,680
Family Matters ends. All of that makes complete sense. This is like, I thought I watched Family

418
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,640
Matters. I thought I watched every goddamn episode of Family Matters like I did for Boy

419
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,120
Meets World, but apparently I fell off at some point, and shit went fucking Roseanne alt reality

420
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,960
crazy. Yeah, apparently there was, like, this show got away from me, like Richard Kimball on the

421
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,320
fugitive, like Family Matters is like hiding in abandoned dog houses and shit, staying away from

422
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,720
me so it could conclude this crazy arc that they have developed here with Steve going into space.

423
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,400
This is like completely out of my sphere of consciousness. But do you think that this falls

424
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,440
in the realm of, like, the writers and creators really wanting to end the show, and like ABC being

425
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,600
like, no, it's too popular. We gotta keep it going. You gotta write another season. And they're like,

426
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,680
okay, sure. I got one for you. Yeah, okay, how about this? Space. Not to mention the fact that

427
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,200
by the time that Family Matters wrapped, there were only like three goddamn people left on that

428
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,320
show because everyone kept fucking bouncing. Everyone kept on diffing and taking right off

429
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,040
and not being on the show anymore. But not Waldo Geraldo Faldo, right? He stayed on.

430
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,440
I think he was on. He's a lifer. Jamie Foxworth out. Not interested. The mom just gonna go ahead

431
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:20,240
and recast her. Joe Marie Payton recast as Judy Ann Elder. Never explained ever. The twins,

432
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,960
the twins have been bounced. The grandma they pulled from the show without explaining it

433
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,600
because they thought she was going to die. They said this actress is going to die. We can't have

434
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,960
that happen again where somebody just disappears and shows up as a different person and we're

435
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:44,160
supposed to pretend like it doesn't fucking matter. She went to space. Only I won't figure

436
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,120
out a clever way to get myself back to Earth. Me and Minkus, they're going to travel up to space

437
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:58,640
together. I'm going to have a cameo in Gravity. Look for me floating through the sky. I have a

438
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,720
hard time in my mind separating the grandmother from Family Matters and the grandmother from

439
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:10,720
Dinosaurs. Which one was which? I know this isn't our traditional thing. If talking about Family

440
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Matters isn't our traditional thing, I frankly don't know what our traditional thing is.

441
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,880
I have a close friend who makes really poor decisions. Given a choice almost without fail,

442
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,920
the wrong one is chosen. Driving while intoxicated, going home with guys she doesn't like and finds

443
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,480
gross, lying for fun, etc. Watching her go through this makes me feel terrible and gives me a lot of

444
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,800
anxiety. Is there anything I can do to improve the situation? I'm a guy who just makes a difference.

445
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,200
That's from Concern in California. Well the driving while intoxicated, you know,

446
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:48,560
the other shit is like she's going to let her go on her life adventures. She needs to experience

447
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,200
the joys of youth while she still can. The driving while intoxicated, that's just foolish.

448
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,640
Bump that. Yeah I drive. I don't need her out on the road. Yeah. You know it's hard.

449
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,120
It sounds like you got to be friends with her like knowing what kind of person she is. She

450
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,000
doesn't seem like she's fallen on some hard times recently where she's making some bad decisions.

451
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,240
This seems like kind of her thing. I'm not sure that there's a lot you can do in that case or

452
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:27,440
like should do because that seems to be the type of person she is like and you decided to to become

453
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,200
friends with her. I don't know that you know it's right for you to try to like shape the course of

454
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,280
her life. You're not like her karate teacher. You don't see something promising in her you can mold.

455
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,600
I mean realistically you have three options, right? Option A is you accept that this person

456
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,880
is just this person and you're friends with them but you're not their boss and you're not their

457
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,840
mentor. Option two is you stop being friends with them because you don't approve of their

458
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:02,240
lifestyle choices and option three is you confront them and say hey you're making really shitty life

459
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,600
choices and if you don't shape up I don't think we can keep being friends. Does anyone ever do

460
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:15,200
that? Has anyone ever I don't think anyone's ever intervened for me and like there was a

461
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,280
time there where I ate hot dogs for basically every meal. I was like the guy Jimmy from the

462
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,040
whitest kids you know in that one sketch where he talks about eating seven hot dogs a day.

463
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,880
That was basically me and nobody ever like stood up to me and said Griffin I love you. You bring

464
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,000
so much joy to my life and you're a treasured neighbor and friend but you gotta stop eating

465
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,400
so many goddamn hot dogs all the goddamn live long day. No usually people just do the slow drift

466
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,240
where it's like they start hanging out with them a little bit less and they start talking to them

467
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,880
and then suddenly it's two years down the road you have no idea where that person lives anymore.

468
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:56,400
No no I mean no I mean yes you're right no you don't see that person anymore. Yep. It's a bummer

469
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,560
but like if somebody's if somebody's fucking up this much this bad like you either intervene and

470
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,240
you bounce. Yeah I I but but do you want to intervene? It doesn't look like this person is

471
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,800
asking for help. I mean I I don't I don't know that you have an obligation or like no I don't

472
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,600
mean an obligation like nobody has an obligation to do stuff but like I don't know that it's you

473
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,560
know I don't I don't know that there's a way unless someone is asking for your help for you

474
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,080
to help them in a way that isn't going to be judgmental and isn't going to create a rift.

475
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,480
I don't think that there's a lot of those opportunities out there. One thing you definitely

476
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:40,320
do is dd for this person as often as you can you know what I mean stay sober and drive them home

477
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,600
just because that's that's something you can actively do you can say hey do you want to ride

478
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,480
to this party together and that way like you know that she doesn't have a car there and she can't

479
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,000
drive drunk and you can dd for it. Aside from that the other things. That's good and everything but

480
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,800
that's bullshit that like you have to fucking babysit this person just because they're they

481
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,280
don't know no I agree I'm saying if you're looking for something to actively do and if you're looking

482
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,680
for something to actively do listen you're either gonna intervene or walk away so you tell this

483
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,320
person I'm gonna walk away if you don't get your shit together and then if they don't then you walk

484
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,920
away and if they do then you know maybe this person has a chance. If you walk away it may not

485
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,920
feel like it but you may actually still be helping them because you become part of their rock bottom

486
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,640
story. I drove away all my friends blah blah blah blah blah blah that you you don't especially the

487
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,000
anxiety man I I don't know there are times in my life and and I'm currently in one of them where

488
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,640
like every day for me is just a battle against like getting overtaken by anxiety or being plagued

489
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:52,000
by anxiety and if someone is introducing that into your life I I think that is one of the more cruel

490
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,040
thoughtless ways for a person to live and that that to me if that person knows that they're that

491
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,760
they're making you feel that way and not doing anything to alter that behavior that's not someone

492
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,000
who cares about you and not someone that you need to invest your time and energy into. I'm not making

493
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
you anxious am I? Not this exact second but when I'm trying to decide on what I want at Jimmy John's

494
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,480
and you do the Jeopardy music thing I hate that and it makes me feel that way. It's so funny though

495
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,240
oh the Jimmy John's guys like love it they like they are every time and they give me a free slice

496
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:32,000
of probolone. Stops giving me probolone. I think he said probolone. It's provolone-y um it's actually

497
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,880
pro provolone it's probo probono probolo it's probrono probolo you got it so I know none of

498
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,360
that was funny especially this weird cheese rant at the end yeah here are some things a

499
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,040
probolone sounds like sorry about your friends sounds like I'm alone. How about a final yahoo

500
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,440
well not a final yahoo we have those those are um grandfathered in this one was sent in by

501
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,640
level seven yahoo shaman and emerald member true davenport thank you true it's by yahoo answers

502
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:09,520
user marie antoinette oh god who asks omg do spiders hold grudges yes so I saw a spider on

503
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,760
my window please tell me if the spider is dangerous or not he was small and black uh

504
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,200
but I don't think it was a black widow and I blew on it and it just froze there like he stared at

505
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,520
me so I shook the blinds and he crawled away what if the spider remembers what I look like and tries

506
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,760
to crawl on me while I sleep what are the chances of a spider crawling on you while sleeping

507
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:35,440
how to get the spider out of my room nothing involving touching it please well no every

508
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,200
muscle in my body yeah god bless is your arachnophobia like public public knowledge

509
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,360
travis is more scared of spiders than literally anybody I know oh god the idea of them is so

510
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:53,840
upsetting to me and in this question the two things that are most upsetting about it is a

511
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,800
a spider crawling on me while I'm asleep and not knowing about it but b a spider going I'm

512
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,480
gonna get that big fucker yeah blow on me did you see that bearded guy he blew on me fucking looked

513
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,120
at me like I was trash I'm looking at that I'm trash I'm looking at that beard looking at beard

514
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,480
now like it might make a good nest I'm gonna live oh god I knew that I I'm not afraid of spiders

515
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:27,200
but the sound my wife makes when she encounters a spider terrifies me more than anything on earth

516
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:34,400
that woman shouts like she has just seen the jigsaw puppet emerge from her closet and I every

517
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,000
time especially if I'm not in the room but if I am in the room like I I will burst through a door

518
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,280
because I assume that I'm going to have to put my two akito classes to use because I assume that

519
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,880
she is about to be killed by the jigsaw puppet that is the sound you say burst through a door

520
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,840
do you mean into the room into the room or out of the room depending on the scenario

521
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,760
Justin unless your bravery game has gotten much better from when we were kids and a

522
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:07,120
bat would get in the house and then you would like fucking craft I said nothing about rodents

523
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,040
or flying rodents that is like the opposite end of the spectrum if that happens I move

524
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,400
bugs are not like we have stink bugs right now because they're they're apparently just loving

525
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,560
it at our house and they that doesn't bother me at all I I nothing bugs and bugs bugs nope bugs

526
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,800
do not bother me spiders it's the way they move their weird eight legs the way that they kind of

527
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,040
raise up and sink down and like do all their shit and then they can drop down from the ceiling and

528
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:42,240
just seem to like hang in the air on their weird spider silk poop it's the worst the fucking worst

529
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,160
I don't want to get emails from people saying like oh I've got tarantulas and spiders a great

530
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,800
pet no they're not spiders and all the bugs and they're all they can hover like David Blaine

531
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,840
and you know what I don't have a problem with spiders outside that's their space I get it man

532
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,720
when I'm out there I'm somewhere I don't belong but when they're in my house isn't that weird

533
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,640
how that works if I if I see a squirrel as I go about my day today nothing if there was a squirrel

534
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,280
in my house I would light that pile of oily rags I keep in the basement and burn that

535
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:22,000
motherfucker down it's in a glass box that says a case of squirrels in case of squirrels

536
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:29,440
I have special insurance that covers me in case of self-arson I got special self-arson

537
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,360
insurance just so I would have that option available to me Mr. McElroy we think we found

538
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,840
the source of the fire it was a giant pile of rags that had been dumped in gasoline we found

539
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,280
the charred squirrel body we found the charred charred you got him you got it but here's the other twist

540
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,600
it's still alive Pet Sematary 3 coming theaters June 2016 that's our family I don't think that

541
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:59,120
family's coming for you I don't think I can wait that long you're gonna have to it's still in pre-pro

542
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,440
Stevie King's still writing the the story I don't think I'm afraid of anything anymore

543
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:13,840
it's only death not even that I got over that like whatever I read an interview with Tim Ear

544
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,160
in the Huntington Quarterly Tim Ear is a local newsman here in Huntington they said Tim what

545
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,680
scares you the most and he said I'm not afraid of anything and now every time I see that motherfucker

546
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,640
on the news I just think look at that little tough guy look at that fucking Tim Ear fearless

547
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,280
fearless now he's the man without fear he's fucking daredevil yeah he's daredevil I'll go

548
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,720
in to get the scoop yeah it doesn't matter halo bullets Tim Ear doesn't care whatever not afraid

549
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,720
of anything how do you stop someone like that you can't can't stop Tim Ear I'll say yes I won't stop

550
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,120
I'll say this there was one day where he took off the news station sick which I knew because I was

551
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,960
friends with a lot of people who worked at the news station he took off sick and then I was at

552
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,600
Marshall University going to a class and I saw that motherfucker jogging and I saw his face and
