1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,120
Okay, this is the introduction to the program. We've been doing our introduction,

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,800
the set, like the very beginning, the same way for 500 and however fucking many episodes.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,160
Wait, are we in it now?

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,960
Yeah, this is the show.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,520
Oh, okay.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,160
I want to start, we're going to start the show, but we're going to do it different,

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
and we have to organically find that.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
All right.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
It can't be a bit, it can't be a bit.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,280
It's got to be like practiced, sounding good, but it's just got to organically happen

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
without me sort of taking control and steering as I have as the Capitan.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Can I try something? Can I just pitch something right off the bat?

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
If you're going to make a strategy or a plan for how to cope with this, you can't.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,320
It's just got to be like, we talk in our book, everybody has a podcast except you in theaters,

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
January 2021.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,800
If you sneak it into the theater, technically it's-

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,160
You got to have a plan.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,880
It's the only book that also works as a mask, so you can just wear it when you go to the theater.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,680
People think it sounds organic when you start doing a show, it sounds natural and organic,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
and I just want to see what organically happens without a strategy for how to begin the program.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, who's that talking?

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
That's my older brother, Justin McElroy.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey, Trav, thanks for, see, I-

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,960
No, you fucked it up.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
I fucked it up.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Justin, it's time for the weekly joke.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
It's time for Justin's joke of the week.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Now we would definitely introduce ourselves in this new introduction.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
Well, this is before Travis and I introduce ourselves.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,400
I historically have done Justin's, it used to be called Justin's naughty joke of the week,

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
and it was actually a joke of the natural nature.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
It was ribald.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
It was like a sexual joke, like dirty as fuck, like some real dock worker shit.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,920
There's no reality in which this podcast, this new podcast intro that we're forging

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,040
would start with before our names, a naughty joke of the week.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
Well, not anymore, now it's just a regular joke.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,760
Me and, I swear to Christ, Justin, me and Travis are going to say our names,

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
but first we do like, hey, oh, and this is our oldest brother, Justin,

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
and Justin, you swing in there and you're like, ha ha.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Here's a joke, here's one I heard, have you heard this?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
Here's one I heard this week.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,360
Dirty, dirtier.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,240
This isn't a joke.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
Dirtier.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
No, no, it's not Justin's dirty joke.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,960
It's not that anymore, just regular joke.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Hey, this isn't a joke.

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,960
Sorry, Justin, clarify, it could still be dirty.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,800
It just doesn't have to be dirty, Justin.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,160
I want to give you room to work.

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,480
I just wanted to start with a fun fact.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
Did you hear about that, the sarcophagus over in Egypt that they found

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
that had been open for 2,000 years, did you hear about this?

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,360
No.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Yeah, there's this sarcophagus that they opened and had been closed for 2,500 years,

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
and here's the wild part.

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,840
The body inside was covered in chocolate and nuts.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
They think it might've been Ferrero Rocher.

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,160
Huh.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,880
Huh, so that's, I did like them better when you were like, what's the difference between them?

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,720
Could you say like, and he had a boner, sorry, because he mentioned nuts and that was really

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,000
close, but if he said he was covered in chocolate and nuts and he had like a boner.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Sorry, let me set you up for that juice and we'll cut all the stuff between this out.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
Did you say nuts?

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
There it is.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,760
What, and what was that sound, Justin?

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
Was it the mummy's boner?

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,520
Was it the mummy's boner?

74
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
Was it your boner?

75
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,040
What was that?

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh, oh, okay, wait, hold on.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's do it again.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's do the, let's just keep it smooth.

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,520
Did you just say nuts?

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,240
Why was the teenage mummy so nervous in class?

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
He couldn't keep his boner under wraps.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,040
Okay.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
All right, so you're kind of, stop, stop.

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,720
That can't be your thing too, Travis.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,680
I know, but-

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Your thing can't also be dirty mummy jokes.

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,800
But it's all I know, Justin, or Griffin, maybe you're Justin now.

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
This nobody knows because we haven't introduced ourselves.

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
Well, you've introduced, we know one thing.

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm not Justin.

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
I don't, they don't know who the fuck I am, but they know I'm not Justin because I haven't

92
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
been telling dirty mummy jokes.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
Are you the teenage mummy?

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
Why didn't you guys decide putting me on blast would be the bit for the introduction?

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
My introduction that I wanted to do was coming up with a new introduction for the show.

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
Justin, you put yourself on blast.

97
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
I teed you up, I said, this is my older brother, Justin.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
And then you choked.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,040
And as punishment, we tried to make you shine.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
Okay, I've paid my penance.

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Starting fresh.

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,200
The person has just pressed play on their podcatcher and action.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,360
Why was the teenage mummy nervous in class?

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
Now, wait a minute.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,640
Why the fuck would it pulled open?

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,960
Are you poaching the mummy boner sort of?

108
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,040
Well, if we're restarting now, we've edited it out when Justin was like the dirty mummy.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
We've edited out all of it.

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
This is just the introduction for the podcast.

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,200
Justin isn't the dirty mummy boy anymore.

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,520
So I saw an opportunity to take it now that things-

113
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
But you haven't said your name.

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
It was cold open.

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
It's a cold open.

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,800
They don't open.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Justin, they don't fucking open up starting it live like, hey, everybody, it's me,

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Skellen Jokesman, and today I'm going to be doing Reince Priebus.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,720
Reince Priebus back in the news.

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
You hear about this?

121
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,720
You hear about this?

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
That's gonna- I call dibs on that.

123
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,040
My thing is talking about what Reince is up to.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
I hear he drives a Prius.

126
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Okay, let's cut all this.

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's cut all this.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
This obviously isn't it.

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
Just press play and action.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
Why was the teenage Reince Priebus nervous in class?

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,840
Okay, stop.

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
You can't-

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
He couldn't get his boner under wraps.

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
Okay, okay.

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,200
You know what?

136
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,160
I'm going to grant you that.

137
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
Oh, Reince Priebus was a mummy too.

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,920
Okay, Trav, do your joke again.

139
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm going to lean into it a little bit better, and I'm sorry for shutting you down.

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
The person presses play on their podcatcher, and this is what they hear.

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
Why was the teenage Reince Priebus, who was also a mummy, nervous in class?

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Because he couldn't keep his boner under wraps?

143
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,020
Fuck!

144
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:01,220
Welcome, everybody, to my brother, my brother, and me.

145
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,100
Wait, okay, you're right.

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,420
Okay, Trav, that didn't work.

147
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Griffin, I'd love for you to try one.

148
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,620
Yeah, sure.

149
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,700
And the person presses play and action.

150
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,060
Did you guys hear about Reince Priebus?

151
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,860
No, I didn't.

152
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,060
I don't think we got it.

153
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,260
I think I did it too fast.

154
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,220
Did you guys hear this latest...

155
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,140
Oh, wait, I kind of like that.

156
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,020
Start the music, and Justin cut the music, and Griffin will come in strong, like a hee-haw moment.

157
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,900
So the very first thing they'll hear is this intro music that comes loaded on the Rodecaster Pro.

158
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,260
No matter fucking what, we aren't doing another take.

159
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,580
This is the intro right here, no matter what.

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,060
Swear it.

161
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,420
Justin, swear it on your life.

162
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,740
I'll swear it, but let me just get the flow.

163
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,420
Block me through it, because I think we're so close to something new.

164
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,900
You do the fucking music.

165
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I hop in there with a sick-ass joke.

166
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,260
There's got to be a hard stop.

167
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,980
No fade out.

168
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,460
It's like, music, and then...

169
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,740
But no matter what, this is it.

170
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,860
Yeah, all right.

171
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay, so I start the music.

172
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,420
Yeah, and then I'll do my joke.

173
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,300
Fade it down.

174
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,260
You bring in a joke.

175
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,900
I fade it back up.

176
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,340
No, no fade out.

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,980
Hard stop.

178
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,260
Fade it louder and louder and louder until it comes to a dead stop.

179
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,100
What?

180
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,780
And three, two, one, play.

181
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,420
Did you guys hear this one?

182
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,220
Fuck, fuck.

183
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,460
You guys hear?

184
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,420
Hold on!

185
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,060
Don't stop it.

186
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,460
Don't stop it.

187
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,940
Don't stop it.

188
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,700
Stop smoking these drugs.

189
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,220
Come on.

190
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Did you guys hear this one about Rice Cream?

191
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,180
He's a mummy now.

192
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,260
He's not smart.

193
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,140
Rice Cream is steady.

194
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,180
He's a mummy now.

195
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,980
He keeps his boner under wrap.

196
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,700
Say your name, I'm Griffin McElroy.

197
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,900
Are you on mic, Griffin?

198
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,460
This is Griffin McElroy.

199
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

200
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,140
I'm Justin McElroy.

201
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,460
I think in post, that's going to sound really good.

202
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,860
Yeah.

203
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,260
We'll just got to tighten it up and sweeten it a little bit.

204
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,180
Yeah, so there's a little dead air, but I think if we could get out some of the tinniness...

205
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,660
I did not notice the dead air, Travis.

206
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,700
I'm so glad your ear is in the show because I did not notice it.

207
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,020
I noticed it only because Griffin had to specifically call my name to tell me to talk.

208
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,900
That was the only reason I caught that there was some dead space.

209
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,260
Almost always a bad sign for the flow of the show.

210
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,340
All right, let's do some fucking questions.

211
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,980
Fuck yes.

212
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,220
Yeah, I bet people thought that was going to be the whole episode.

213
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,820
I bet it could feel that way sometimes.

214
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,620
Yeah, sometimes.

215
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,020
But it never is.

216
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,820
I think that...

217
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,700
Can I say something?

218
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,660
I think that part of the reason people struggle with the introductions to this program sometimes,

219
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,340
and why it has put off, I would estimate at this point, innumerable listeners,

220
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,820
new listeners to the program.

221
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,340
And old listeners.

222
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,740
Yeah, I like to think that some of them got off the ship at some point.

223
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
But I think a lot of people try.

224
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,660
They're like, I've heard about this show, I'm going to try it.

225
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,900
I think part of the problem with the introductions is that a few times

226
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,780
we have started an introduction that has become an entire episode.

227
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,980
And I think that now when you're listening to the introduction,

228
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,500
there's this back of your throat fear that this could be the whole episode.

229
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,140
And it's honestly, Juice, it's kind of fucked up that you are

230
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,020
continuing to suspend those sensitive listeners to that fear.

231
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,500
You're right.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
I am sorry, I'm sorry.

233
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,500
This is show.

234
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,740
Show has begun.

235
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,900
Recently, a couple of friends invited me to do an escape room with them.

236
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,940
It was kind of fun.

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,500
So when they asked me again the next week, I agreed to do another one.

238
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,220
Now they're calling the three of us an escape room team

239
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,860
and want to do them his office twice a week, traveling across the country, different ones.

240
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,980
I got a name for your team, the Super Spreaders.

241
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,620
As much as I've mildly enjoyed doing these puzzles and unlocking things,

242
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm clearly not into this as the others and need a polite way of telling them

243
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,620
I don't want to be in the team.

244
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,700
No, a lot of rooms require a minimum three people.

245
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,740
So me not being there means they can't do a lot of rooms.

246
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,300
Bothers.

247
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,540
That's right, supposed to be brothers.

248
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,340
Oh, bother.

249
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,700
How do I escape from this escape room team?

250
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,100
Sick of solving puzzles in Scotland.

251
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,180
You know, Juice said that about the Super Spreaders,

252
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,180
but I will say Scotland is, I believe, in a somewhat better place than we are.

253
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,980
Everywhere is.

254
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,260
Yeah, why would an escape room have a minimum of people that could participate?

255
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,860
They charge per head, eh?

256
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,340
So-

257
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,500
Well, but I mean, at that point, just charge a minimum.

258
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,020
Say like, if one, hey, if you want to come, Travis, and do an escape room by yourself-

259
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
Who's that asshole?

260
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,260
I guess it's, I guess, I mean, you did say your own name.

261
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,460
It would be me.

262
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,100
I did want to say, before I knew that you volunteered for this,

263
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,620
who's that asshole that's like, no one else come in.

264
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,820
I'm going to do this one by myself.

265
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,980
Well, if they're going to do a bad job, listen, this is the thing.

266
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,780
I have done many, many escape rooms.

267
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,580
And I would say, specifically, Adol, Raffi, and I have done a lot of escape rooms together.

268
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,660
If we are at a convention at the same time, we will do escape rooms.

269
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,540
Now, have we done escape rooms where there have been,

270
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,500
let's say, some dead weight on the team?

271
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,580
Yeah, totally, totally, totally.

272
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,060
But the two of us can carry it.

273
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,020
You know what I mean?

274
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,220
I don't know where I'm going with this.

275
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,660
I just wanted to brag about how good Adol, Raffi, and I are at escape rooms.

276
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,740
Good, people love that.

277
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,660
I think that you're very lucky to be, if I could be,

278
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,580
if I had the kind of life where I could even entertain the fucking idea

279
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:49,860
of being part of a, quote, escape room team, end quote, I would celebrate.

280
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,580
I would celebrate, I would say a thank you prayer every morning

281
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,020
and every night before bedtime for the cool life that I had

282
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,980
where I could go and solve the puzzles of Puzzle Masters

283
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,660
across this great country of ours, or world, this fucking globe of ours.

284
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,780
I know this isn't helpful, but change your whole fucking outlook

285
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,180
because you should like this more.

286
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,460
I mean, it's something, isn't it?

287
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:14,820
Yeah.

288
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,260
If you go into an escape room, you know what the nicest thing about escape rooms are?

289
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,460
If you go into an escape room, by definition, you haven't been there before.

290
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,100
You know what I mean?

291
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,860
Like at least it's new room.

292
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,180
I never want to leave.

293
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,300
This is new room.

294
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,820
I'm so excited to be here.

295
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,780
Let me reframe your thinking, question asker,

296
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,740
of why escape rooms are the greatest fucking things in the world.

297
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,580
All around us in what I'm going to call real world, non-escape rooms,

298
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,740
there are problems that are completely unquantifiable.

299
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,180
In escape room?

300
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,140
What's this?

301
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,580
Red book goes on the green bookshelf and something open?

302
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,780
That is a quantifiable, solvable problem

303
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,660
that when you've solved it, you can feel a little bit better about life.

304
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,700
Feel anything.

305
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,420
Feel anything in the escape room.

306
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,540
Ooh, that's a good tagline for Griffin's escape rooms.

307
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Come in, feel something.

308
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,780
Feel it.

309
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,940
Switch that light switch on and off three times

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,180
and I'll come on over the loudspeaker.

311
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,060
I'll be like, you fucking did it.

312
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,260
Feel it.

313
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,700
Embrace this novelty.

314
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Did you hear that box click open?

315
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,460
That's joy in your heart, my friend.

316
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,060
It would be me in the escape room with a group of super solvers.

317
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,020
Like my fam, we did an escape room.

318
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,500
I can't remember.

319
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,220
We were on tour last year.

320
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,460
We did an escape room back when tour was a thing we could do.

321
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,700
An escape room and leave house was things we could do.

322
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,460
We solved it real fast.

323
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,500
We got out of there like 38 minutes with a lot of time left.

324
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,620
What time was this?

325
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,260
This was when we were on tour in Milwaukee at the City 13.

326
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,300
City 13.

327
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,860
Yes.

328
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,500
And it was that kind of like post-punk like diner.

329
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,740
Like cyberpunk bar diner shit.

330
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,380
Yeah, it was dope.

331
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,580
We got out of there real fast.

332
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,420
But these days, I probably would have like had hand on the doorknob at 38 minutes.

333
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,980
Like, do you guys just wanna fucking kick everything?

334
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,940
We'll do 21 minutes and 50 seconds left in here

335
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,460
and then leave when we absolutely have to.

336
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,300
But maybe we could just like explore the space.

337
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,500
Sniffing air.

338
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,300
It's new.

339
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,780
Maybe we can leave more problems than we solve.

340
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,380
That's cool.

341
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,340
Create some new ones.

342
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,100
Do you think it's a hard, you know how bad a real dangerous situation is

343
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,660
when there's a fire at an escape room place?

344
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,020
Not because the doors are locked or anything,

345
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,940
because as we all know, the doors are not locked.

346
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,620
It's the biggest lie they ever told.

347
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,100
Wait, what?

348
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,220
But yeah.

349
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,660
Yeah, you just open it.

350
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,700
If the fire alarm starts going off and you're doing an escape room,

351
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,620
you're gonna be like, huh, okay.

352
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,300
How did I?

353
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey, Valerie, do that again.

354
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,620
Step on that again, because maybe it'll turn it off.

355
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,980
I don't know what it means.

356
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,500
Count the flashes.

357
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,060
That is the thing, I wonder how there's gotta be a study somewhere

358
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,020
on how doing fire drills has ruined anybody's reaction to actual like fire alarms.

359
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,060
Because now as an adult, if I'm in a place and I hear a fire alarm,

360
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,020
the first words out of my mouth are, it's probably not real.

361
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,220
Oh, what an asshole.

362
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,180
What asshole did this?

363
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,860
I think if I ran an escape room and I was staffing up,

364
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,980
I would hire somebody and the first day would be business as usual.

365
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,660
I'd be like, you lock up tonight.

366
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,260
And then when they tried to leave that night,

367
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,380
they would find that the front door was locked from the outside.

368
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,860
Okay.

369
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,700
The test, the true test begins now.

370
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
I am almost certain.

371
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,420
I am describing the plot of the escape room horror movie.

372
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,380
I think that's true.

373
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,860
If I was hiring for an escape room,

374
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,620
I would hire a plant that anytime a group started,

375
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,620
they go in there with 10, suddenly there's 11 people,

376
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,500
but there's a lot going on.

377
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
So maybe they don't notice the extra person.

378
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
And the extra person's job is to just go like,

379
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
I don't think we're gonna solve this one, guys.

380
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,700
And just like really talk up how hard the puzzles are.

381
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,140
And like, oh, wait, hold on.

382
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,460
Nope, nope, this isn't doing it.

383
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,740
Fuck, I thought we had it.

384
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,660
No, I don't think we're solving this one, guys.

385
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,740
At some point they could pretend to die.

386
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,820
Yeah.

388
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,540
And they would use their core field to turn sunlight

389
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,020
into energy.

390
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,460
It's not a real plant, Justin.

391
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,340
Goes to visit his mommy.

392
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,820
Oh, can I say one other thing?

393
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,780
Can I help the person?

394
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,740
Can we do one thing?

395
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,020
Has concerns he forgets them.

396
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,500
It's really, actually, can I say, you can't.

397
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,860
It would be fucking wild to interrupt Travis now.

398
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,620
And remembers being small.

399
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,580
It feels wrong to do, but I did want to say something.

400
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,900
Justin, the team will know if you don't want to do it

401
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,260
because your puzzle performance will suffer.

402
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,100
Playing under the table and fishing.

403
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,700
Welcome to Under the Table and Fishing.

404
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Was he eating a sandwich?

405
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,340
Was Dave eating a full turkey wrap?

406
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,820
Oh, I was eating a sandwich.

407
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,500
It was an egg salad.

408
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,740
This is just a really good opportunity for you to bust out

409
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,500
like a, I don't eat too much.

410
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,340
I eat too much, drink too much, want too much, too much.

411
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,060
How did Dave Matthews' picnic get ruined?

412
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,660
How?

413
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,420
Oh, and smart shit.

414
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,380
And they had boners?

415
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,380
All over it.

416
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,500
Their dicks were out.

417
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,020
They're all over it, dicks.

418
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,420
So.

419
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,980
Yeah, dude.

420
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,580
In Under the Table and Fishing, I'm gonna read you some lyrics.

421
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,740
They might be Dave Matthews, they might be fish.

422
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,740
And this week, special twist, there's one by Third Eye Blind.

423
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,260
Okay.

424
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,220
I know, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna bloodhound that one out.

425
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,340
So let's start.

426
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,820
Don't let it get away.

427
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,100
And if we did, we're gonna get it back.

428
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,020
And in time, you and me, we will, we will, we will,

429
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,980
we will be over and again and again.

430
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,260
That's Dave.

431
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,700
That feels fish?

432
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,380
That feels fish.

433
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,180
Fish.

434
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,380
That is Dave Matthews.

435
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,180
Again and again.

436
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,860
All right.

437
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,020
I've been prepping for this segment by listening to every Dave Matthews song

438
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,940
and every Fish song.

439
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,580
And does anybody have that?

440
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,780
Oh, that's why I was sad.

441
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,280
Anvil.

442
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,260
Travis, can I do my joke, please?

443
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,220
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

444
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,300
I've been prepping for this segment by listening to every Dave Matthews band song

445
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,340
and every Fish song.

446
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,540
And I have, now I have the munchies.

447
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,820
Fuck, wow, man.

448
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,940
Oh, yeah.

449
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Fucking yeah.

450
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,900
Dude, yeah.

451
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,660
I guess I just don't follow Justin.

452
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,940
Pass the incense.

453
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,440
Okay.

454
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,880
Okay.

455
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,620
Here's another one.

456
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,940
Bang, bang, you're dead now, could be real.

457
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,500
I got a bag of smoke.

458
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,340
Come on, let's make a deal.

459
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,620
Yeah, fish, fish, fish.

460
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,860
Yeah, bridges burn, but tomorrow is another day to feed the world

461
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,700
and go outside and play.

462
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,260
No, Dave.

463
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm flipping on it.

464
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm gonna stick with Fish.

465
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,380
That is Dave.

466
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,780
I thought, let's say he twisted it on me.

467
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,180
He thought I want to write the first stanza as though I were Fish

468
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,340
and the second stanza as though I were Dave.

469
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,940
Mm-hmm, we built a kingdom out of lies

470
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,060
and then we blindly fanned the fires.

471
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,660
We warmed our hands with glowing coals,

472
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,460
but now they rain down from the skies.

473
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,380
Third eye.

474
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,500
Third eye, they're in line.

475
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,540
Yeah, third eye blind.

476
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,260
That is Fish.

477
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,300
Damn.

478
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,420
The song is leaves.

479
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,980
I am 0 for 3 right now.

480
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,260
I used to be good at this game.

481
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,580
Because of you, girl, beautiful, beautiful girl,

482
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,780
take it easy on yourself and make it easy on me.

483
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,700
Because I just want to make you,

484
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,140
I just want to make you,

485
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,580
come on, come on, come on, come.

486
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,980
That's, that's-

487
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
It's not Fish.

488
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,060
It's not Fish.

489
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm going to suppose that it is one of Dave Matthews'

490
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,980
many songs about fingering.

491
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,500
It's so Dave.

492
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,980
That is one of Dave's hornier tracks.

493
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,060
It's called come on, come on.

494
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,500
Okay.

495
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,580
So that's 4 for Justin, 1 for Griffin.

496
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,100
In case you're wondering, yes,

497
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Crash is one of the fingering champs.

498
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,660
Yes, of course.

499
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,460
Because he's written Minion.

500
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,740
What a horror song.

501
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,900
Press me down, then I pressurize, then I rise up.

502
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,020
Like diamonds, rise up all you diamonds.

503
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,820
So rise up, rise up all you diamonds.

504
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,140
Pressurize all you diamonds.

505
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,500
Third eye, it doesn't feel like Fish or Dave Matthews' band,

506
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
so I am going to hit third eye blind on this one.

507
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,140
I want third eye blind.

508
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,820
It is third eye blind, correct.

509
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,100
There is the tower like a solitary flower

511
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,940
standing in the snow

512
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,860
as the wolves all wait below

513
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,580
and you're walking on the ledge, throwing bread crusts off the edge.

514
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,300
That feels Fishy to me.

515
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,660
I was thrown at first because the use of tower and then flower

516
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,980
made me feel like this is probably a phallic,

517
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,260
sexual Dave Matthews song about sex.

518
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,980
But I am going to switch to Fish.

519
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,740
It is Fish.

520
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,660
Okay, yeah.

521
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,180
And I do want to point out Dave Matthews' songs aren't phallic.

522
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,420
No.

523
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,260
He only writes about fingering.

524
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah.

525
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,420
Well, a finger could be a tower as well, I guess.

526
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,620
I guess, sure.

527
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,780
Okay, it's not what anybody's thinking of.

528
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,980
Let's be honest.

529
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,940
I love your hair in the mornings, you know.

530
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,580
You love to run wild and let the mane flow,

531
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,340
but you run away, but we meet again soon

532
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,220
south of the border and over the moon.

533
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,660
Dave Matthews, man.

534
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,700
Fish.

535
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,700
That's Fish.

536
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,020
Shade.

537
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,220
Wow.

538
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,260
It was, and I could tell because it was kind of horny,

539
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,340
but not, it doesn't, Dave's gonna finish.

540
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,580
You know what I mean?

541
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,020
Okay, this is my question.

542
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,500
Okay.

543
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,420
Are all song lyrics the same or do the two of them

544
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,060
just have a lot of crossover tonally?

545
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,100
I think that the reason I do this whole segment

546
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,500
is because they have a lot of crossover tonally, Justin.

547
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
All right, I'm gonna do this Yahoo now.

548
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,780
It's sent in by Merritt Palmer, the prospector.

549
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,580
Thank you, prospector.

550
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,020
It is from Yahoo Answers user, Christopher,

551
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,700
who asks, and this one might be kind of quick.

552
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,140
Should the laugh track on sitcoms be just one person

553
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,900
instead of a crowd of laughter?

554
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,400
Ooh.

555
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,180
Now, do you guys think they mean one person across all sitcoms

556
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,780
or one person per sitcom?

557
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,100
You mean the same person.

558
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,500
Yes.

559
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,340
Is it like Dave's track and Dave does the laugh for everyone

560
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,260
or is it like, well, Dave goes with friends

561
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,460
and Steven goes with Big Bang Theory?

562
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,500
I am interested in the idea of the laugher

563
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,340
being someone we, like, become familiar with as a nation.

564
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,580
Right, I like, yeah.

565
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,660
This is Terrence and, but they can't,

566
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,420
the problem is there's never an episode of Big Bang Theory

567
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,460
where the audience isn't super into it.

568
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,020
Do you know what I mean?

569
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,820
They're loving it.

570
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,020
That should be a thing.

571
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,660
It's like there's an episode of Big Bang Theory

572
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,100
where just Sheldon does his thing, like, you know,

573
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,580
he pisses his pants and then he's like, bazinga,

574
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,980
and the audience is just like, yeah.

575
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,220
Well, but think about that, right?

576
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,460
Like, usually Terrence is loving it, right?

577
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,780
But then there's an episode where the thing Sheldon did

578
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,140
you thought was pretty funny,

579
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,100
but Terrence didn't see him as a fear.

580
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,140
So what's that mean?

581
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,620
What's that mean?

582
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,140
It's like, is Terrence okay?

583
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,780
What's going on?

584
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,980
That is the problem, right?

585
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,780
Is you would start to have more insight

586
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,540
and probably concern about the real man Terrence

587
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,900
than you would about the bazinga guys,

588
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,140
the bazinga gals over at Big Bang Theory.

589
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,020
And I think eventually you end up like campaigning

590
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,980
to get the camera back at the back of the audience

591
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,380
so I could see Terrence in his chair

592
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,380
while I'm watching them do, you know, their science

593
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,700
and like jokes about the Green Lantern and stuff.

594
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,460
But we're talking about multi-camera sitcom shows.

595
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,540
That's going to be a tough nut to putt.

596
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,100
That's cool.

597
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,780
You have to aim them all through Terrence.

598
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,820
Can we just take a second to appreciate tough nut to putt

599
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,460
as the new powerful slogan for something?

600
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,180
I think maybe instead we just get

601
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,300
at the top of every episode of every sitcom,

602
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,100
we get about two minutes interview with Terrence

603
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,500
just to see how he's doing.

604
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,940
And most of the time,

605
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,500
I imagine this is sort of a poet laureate position,

606
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,900
sort of venerated where we can trust his sort of opinions

607
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,020
about comedy and jokes and laughing and stuff.

608
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,300
So when he sits up there and he's like,

609
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,620
hey guys, it's me, Terrence, all strapped in,

610
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,780
ready for another fucking great episode of Big,

611
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,580
they wouldn't say fucking,

612
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,100
but ready to laugh at another great episode of Big Bang Theory.

613
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,060
No, maybe with Terrence there's no censorship.

614
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,940
We want unbridled, unfiltered Terrence.

615
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,540
Okay, but then you know like,

616
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,140
okay, so if Terrence laughs during this one,

617
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,460
it's okay for me and all my pals

618
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
at this Big Bang party that I'm throwing,

619
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,660
which is a Big Bang Theory watch party,

620
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,220
and then we're all gonna have, we're all gonna fuck later.

621
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,940
It's okay for us to laugh.

622
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,540
But then if you see an interview with him

623
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,780
before an episode of Frasier 2,

624
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,860
and he's like, ah, hey guys, yeah, my cat's sick.

625
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,260
Anyway, let's get on with the show.

626
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,420
Then you know like,

627
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,740
it's okay that I'm laughing when Terrence doesn't.

628
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,220
Do you think that the risk would become

629
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,620
that TV shows would start to be developed

630
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,380
specifically with Terrence in mind?

631
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
Where it'd be like, what's Terrence like?

632
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,500
What's here?

633
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,260
We gotta get in front of Terrence, people.

634
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,220
Tell me the name of Terrence's third grade teacher.

635
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,860
Give me all the information you can on Terrence.

636
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,500
Do you guys think there is a static number of days

637
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,180
after the series finale of Big Bang Theory,

638
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,980
at which point we will stop referencing Big Bang Theory

639
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
as an ongoing concern?

640
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,420
Because currently, by my math,

641
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,500
it has been roughly

642
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,620
maybe 450 days by the calendar

643
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,460
since the final episode on May 16th, 2019.

644
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,900
Can I tell you the problem here, Jameon?

645
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,500
Problem is-

646
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,180
I think I know the problem, Trav.

647
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,020
Is that I can't think of another TV show?

648
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,060
Right.

649
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,300
Yeah.

650
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,740
Are there other ones that are going on right now?

651
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,780
Not on that scale.

652
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,460
I mean, listen, we can talk about Supernatural,

653
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,620
but that's not a multi-camera comedy.

654
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,100
Again, please don't talk about Supernatural.

655
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,260
I'm just saying it's been a year and a half since.

656
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,180
First off, do you guys feel like...

657
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,260
Okay.

658
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,940
Do you feel like the nation mourned Big Bang Theory enough?

659
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,180
Because everyone has been very excited

660
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,660
about Big Bang Theory's existence,

661
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,540
but did the nation mourn Big Bang Theory's passion?

662
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,060
Because I feel like I didn't see

663
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,220
the funeral for a friend proceedings

664
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,500
that one would expect from saying goodbye to characters here.

665
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,020
Well, I think we're in the stage where a loved one passes

666
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,740
and you spend a lot of time watching old home movies.

667
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,380
Except in this case, it's like 800 episodes of reruns.

668
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,740
So it takes a while to get through those home movies

669
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,860
before you're like,

670
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,900
oh, you know what, I don't really miss that loved one anymore.

671
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,460
That's it.

672
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,460
It's gonna come to us 2035

673
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,220
when someone's gonna accidentally say Bazinga

674
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,500
and it'll be like, oh, and then the cavity will feel it.

675
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,020
And just to answer your question with another perspective,

676
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,820
it has been, to my actual math,

677
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,780
nearly 6,000 days since Frasier went off the air.

678
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,060
Fair.

679
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Fair, but I think when we talk about Frasier,

680
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,620
it is tinged with where the age is folded into the rhythm.

681
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,260
Right, okay.

682
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,780
And I feel like Big Bang Theory is our reach

683
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,700
for current ongoing.

684
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,580
Okay, fair, this is a fair point, Justin,

685
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,700
because I did go, when I first started this,

686
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,620
I said something about Friends and I thought,

687
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,380
but Friends is canceled.

688
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,780
I need to talk about an ongoing show.

689
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,100
I know Big Bang Theory.

690
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,820
But I really blame, I don't blame me or you,

691
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,100
I blame the nation for not mourning the gang.

692
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,620
I feel like the gang passed.

693
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,540
Can I tell you guys an interesting fact, please?

694
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,700
12 and a half million people watched Big Bang Theory

695
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,260
on May 9th, which was the week before the show ended, okay?

696
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,060
Okay. The finale episode,

697
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,940
18 and a half million people tuned in for that final ep.

698
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,900
So that means that here in this great nation of ours,

699
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,220
there are 6 million discrete humans, give or take,

700
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,660
who are like, listen, I don't watch Big Bang Theory,

701
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,820
but I'm gonna be there when they put it in the fucking ground.

702
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,100
Yeah. I wanna make sure you stay dead.

703
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,620
Stay dead, Sheldon. Stay dead, glasses.

704
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,940
Stay dead, other girl.

705
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,100
I just don't get, with numbers like that,

706
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,220
why they canceled it.

707
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,140
Why did they even cancel it?

708
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
Why did they cancel Big Bang Theory?

709
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,660
Well, because they wanted to rope in those 6 million people

710
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,500
who are like, I don't watch the show,

711
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,980
but I will be there when it dies.

712
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,420
I wanna be there when the plug is pulled on Green Lantern

713
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,060
and the flash shirt guy and everybody.

714
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,100
Why did they cancel shows like Big Bang Theory and Friends?

715
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't get it.

716
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,780
Now, Travis, you're being silly.

717
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,380
You know I'm a bit more savvy about what happens

718
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,620
behind that beautiful lens that makes the Friends and the Frasier.

719
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,500
And so this is how they do it.

720
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:32,820
Okay.

721
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,700
Hey, everybody, come with us to CBS as we mourn

722
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,860
the passing of Big Bang Theory, a show you don't watch,

723
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,500
but you should.

724
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,500
People are going to ask you,

725
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,340
where were you when Big Bang Theory went off the air?

726
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,620
So please come and watch it.

727
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,140
And then 11 million people were like, yes, yes.

728
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,060
It sounds like a Friday night to me.

729
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,140
And they showed up and they watched it.

730
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,020
And then at the end, everybody else dies,

731
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,300
but Sheldon crawls inside of his reverse chrysalis

732
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,620
and becomes Young Sheldon.

733
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:08,020
And now that's 11 million built-in viewers of Young Sheldon.

734
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,780
Big Bang Theory never went off the air

735
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,500
because it's carried on in the memories of the past

736
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,460
of the character of Sheldon.

737
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,100
The chrysalis is reforming around Sheldon.

738
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,580
He will reemerge with a new Big Bang Theory once he has matured.

739
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,100
You know, I was going to point out that after Cheers,

740
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,980
they spun off a series called Frasier.

741
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,220
And that was also popular.

742
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,780
And I thought, why doesn't every popular sitcom do that?

743
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,060
And then I remembered that Joey was a concern for a while.

744
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,100
Love Joey.

745
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,620
And that kind of answered my question.

746
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,460
Love Joey.

747
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,020
Sandwiches.

748
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,500
Italian sandwiches.

749
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,940
He had a lot of premarital sex.

750
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,260
Premarital sex.

751
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,180
And he was always interested in people's well-being.

752
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,700
He was always like, hey, how are you?

753
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,500
How are you doing?

754
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:16,420
Uninvited sexual energy, but we loved it, I guess.

755
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,660
We really liked all the gay panic.

756
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,300
That was fun.

757
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,340
Gay panic, Joey.

758
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,340
Oh, don't touch me.

759
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,140
You're a guy.

760
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,940
You know, that kind of thing.

761
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,180
Yeah.

762
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,980
Oh, what are we?

763
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,940
Oh.

764
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,420
What are we?

765
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,460
Oh, what if we hugged?

766
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,260
That'd be so gay.

767
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,380
You know, that kind of, you get it.

768
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,580
How aren't you doing?

769
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Because you're a guy, Joey.

770
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,660
You get it.

771
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,180
Ladies and gentlemen, as Joey's dad, Christopher Walken, apparently.

772
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,020
Griffin, what would it be like if Joey and Joey's dad hugged?

773
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,460
Just this one time, Joey, my boy.

774
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,060
As it turns out, if I try to do Joey from Friends, I can sort of

775
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,980
sidestep my way into Christopher Walken,

776
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,300
which is an exciting revelation for me.

777
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,100
Let's take a break.

778
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,700
If I'm going to afford the box set of Joey on DVD,

779
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,420
I need to earn some money.

780
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,020
It's half of one disc.

781
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,740
There's a label on the front of the case saying, this is sharp.

782
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,580
Please, if you are the type of person who just bought Joey on half a DVD,

783
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,220
you shouldn't touch it because it's real sharp.

784
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,340
Please affix this to half of a corn tortilla.

785
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,220
It's a function and spin.

786
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,340
The other half of the disc is just all the episodes of the cape

787
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,180
and you can kind of glue it together.

788
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,740
And then as you spin, the cape makes some special appearances on Joey.

789
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,460
It combines them stereoscopically.

790
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,940
So it looks like Joey's wearing a cape.

791
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,820
It's incredible.

792
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,780
You plugged this half of the Joey DVD disc

793
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:57,140
into Sonic and Knuckles expansion pack for Sega Genesis.

794
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Hey, can I tell you all about me undies?

795
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,620
Yeah.

796
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,100
I'm hearing a lot of background activity.

797
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,780
It makes me wonder if somebody's...

798
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,820
It sounded like somebody was wrapping a present, if I'm being honest.

799
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
And I guess the question is, is it for me?

800
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,020
Yeah, if it's underwear.

801
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,220
Thank you.

802
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,700
Yeah.

803
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,340
Happy day.

804
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,740
Thank you.

805
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,140
I will always accept underwear if it's me undies

806
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,900
because if it's not, it's trash.

807
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,860
And that's my new motto that they can use whenever they want.

808
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,540
They are the most comfortable underwear.

809
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,980
You're saying if a stranger walked up to you and said,

810
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,820
here, take this pair of me undies, no questions asked,

811
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,540
you would do it?

812
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,420
Yeah.

813
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,380
Wow.

814
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah.

815
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,460
Yeah, they're pretty comfortable.

816
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,660
Travis, I think it's kind of fucked up

817
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,060
that in the middle of our commercial for me undies,

818
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,340
you would suggest otherwise.

819
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,140
But anyway, I have so many me undies right now.

820
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,500
And what I really like about them

821
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,740
is because it is the spookiest season of the year,

822
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,900
I love to look scary down there.

823
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,860
And so I have some that have fun.

824
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,700
They're fun at the end of the day,

825
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,180
but they are still pretty spooky Halloween prints.

826
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,740
Yeah.

827
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,860
If you're into cats or blood or skeletons,

828
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,460
in a spooky context, or hell,

829
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
you can wear skeleton underwear whenever.

830
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,060
No one's gonna call the cops on you.

831
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,260
These are just, they're so fucking soft.

832
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,860
And you never have to run out of me undies

833
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,140

That's meundies.com slash my brother.

840
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,940
Can I tell you about Stitch Fix?

841
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,500
Yep.

842
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,860
I got the greatest shirt,

843
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,380
the greatest shirt, my new favorite shirt from Stitch Fix.

844
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,620
And we talk about with Stitch Fix,

845
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,820
if you've heard us talk about it before,

846
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,260
that they get to know your style and your budget

847
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,180
and the colors you like, all of those things.

848
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,580
And this felt like getting a gift from my best friend,

849
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,060
where it was this really beautiful dress shirt

850
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,620
that had kind of a little bit of almost like a firework,

851
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,060
like popcorn design in.

852
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
But as part of the fireworks and popcorn

853
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,260
was like little tiny skulls in there,

854
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,180
it was so fucking cool.

855
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,140
That is cool.

856
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,340
Yes, I love it.

857
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,260
And I saw it and I ran into the room where Teresa was

858
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,700
to say like, look at this.

859
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,500
Because Stitch Fix is a personal styling company

860
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,820
that makes getting the clothes you love effortless

861
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,500
and they really do get to know you.

862
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
You can go through and say like, I like this shirt.

863
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,100
This is the kind of thing I want to dress for.

864
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
This is what I like to do, that kind of thing.

865
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,860
And it feels really personalized to you.

866
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,580
And you pay a $20 styling fee for each fix

867
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,180
and it's credited towards anything you keep.

868
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,260
So you don't have to keep everything in the box.

869
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,460
If it comes, you try it on, you're like,

870
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,060

877
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,500

00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,060
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

879
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,260
Are you feeling elevated levels of anxiety?

880
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,020
Do you quake uncontrollably,

881
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,180
even thinking about watching cable news?

882
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,980
Do you have disturbing nightmares

883
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,100
only to realize it's two in the afternoon and you're up?

884
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,220
If you've experienced one or more of these symptoms,

885
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,620
you may have FNO, news overload.

886
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,300
Fortunately, there's treatment.

887
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,060
Hi, I'm Dave Holmes, host of Troubled Waters.

888
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,460
Troubled Waters helps fight FNO.

889
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,660
That's because Troubled Waters stimulates your joy zone.

890
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,860
On Troubled Waters,

891
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,780
two comedians will battle one another

892
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,700
for pop culture supremacy.

893
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,700
So join me, Dave Holmes, for two to two doses

894
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,460
of Troubled Waters a month.

895
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,900
The cure for your news overload.

896
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Available on maximumfun.org

897
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,740
or wherever you get your podcasts.

898
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,780
Troubled Waters.

899
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,300
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

900
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,100
howl.

901
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh, oh, God.

902
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,140
Duh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

903
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,940
Howl.

904
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,740
Travis, run.

905
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,060
I'm already gone.

906
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,980
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

907
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,900
I want to munch.

908
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,400
Huh.

909
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,160
Squad.

910
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,900
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

911
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,140
I want to munch.

912
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,860
Squad.

913
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,340
Huh, I don't like this guy.

914
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,620
I love this guy, fuck it.

915
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,220
Welcome to munch, squad.

916
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,300
Wait, wait, I formally invite you into our podcast.

917
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,620
Beautiful spirit.

918
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,900
Oh, is he a vampire?

919
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,940
I thought he was like a Frankenstein's monster.

920
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,180
Not just any vampire.

921
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,860
The Donut Dracula.

922
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,660
The Donut Dracula?

923
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,700
Count Donut.

924
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,540
Did you just change your name?

925
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,940
It's a long name, so I'm getting it all out.

926
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,100
So is it Count Donut Dracula?

927
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,020
I think he said Donut Dracula, Count Donut.

928
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,740
Oh, so his real name is Donut Dracula, but his title is Count Donut.

929
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,860
My real name is Kevin, but knowing that would give you immense power over me.

930
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,580
Oh, okay, Kevin.

931
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,420
Kevin, just sit still for just a second.

932
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,980
Trap, just to explain what just happened.

933
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,220
Justin, in his mind, was trying to run the calculus on whether or not the word

934
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,020
donut sounded enough like count that he could say it in lieu of count.

935
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,260
So he said it out loud and heard it, and then he said,

936
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,420
nobody's gonna understand what that meant.

937
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,780
No, no, no, it's way different.

938
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,020
So he switched it over to Count Donut.

939
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,780
Donutula, though, I think maybe-

940
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,140
Donutula is also nothing.

941
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,380
I think he did the best with what he had to work with.

942
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,940
Like, I'm not-

943
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:42,340
I am the guest host for this most delicious episode of Munch, Squad,

944
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:51,140
podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

945
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,740
Hey, Count Donut, just real quick.

946
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,260
You're better at this than Justin is.

947
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,020
Thank you.

948
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm glad I killed him.

949
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,920
What?

950
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,460
You also sound a little bit like Gru from the Minions movies.

951
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:05,860
Oh, I love those.

952
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
I have not seen him, hardly.

953
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:13,380
I missed the first few, and I didn't know where to jump on.

954
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,820
Yeah, you can get pretty lost if you just come in on to Sicilumi 3.

955
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,860
There's three now.

956
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,900
I think so.

957
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,100
Well, they also made a standalone Minions film.

958
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,940
I was so excited about the new Minions movie, but then it's got delayed to 2021.

959
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,620
Oh, yeah, it's this coronavirus.

960
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,420
Have you heard about this?

961
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,820
Are you having trouble with this?

962
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,300
Everyone's in their homes.

963
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,500
It's a challenging time.

964
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,020
And with a mask on, it's probably hard to sink your teethers into their neck.

965
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,380
You're wearing a mask, right, Count?

966
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
Of course I am.

967
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:54,340
I am immune to all earthly pathogens, but I want to set a good example.

968
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,220
That's good.

969
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,940
Have you voted?

970
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,940
Have you voted?

971
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,420
Yes, I voted long ago for the devil.

972
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,060
No, it's a presidential election, and there's a lot of

973
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,620
politics in it.

974
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,540
Are you a citizen of nowhere?

975
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,500
Oh, so you're just living here rent-free, not paying taxes?

976
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,060
What the fuck?

977
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:23,620
I am talking to you from my home in Donutvania.

978
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,820
Oh, okay.

979
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,700
Yeah, Trav, we need to let him speak because I am curious of what he's doing here.

980
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,540
Oh, right, I forgot that this was a segment.

981
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:29,860
Yeah.

982
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,660
Yes, well, excellent.

983
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,220
Thank you.

984
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:41,220
I want to tell you about some new Halloween offerings, if it is a spooky time of year,

985
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,020
of course.

986
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:51,780
Some Halloween offerings from local donut chains there in your United States of America.

987
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,100
Okay.

988
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,940
All right, let him rip.

989
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:02,820
May I adopt the typical cadence of a classic American as I read these?

990
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,660
Or else this episode's going to be 87 minutes long.

991
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

992
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
I do not consent to that.

993
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,500
We can't have fucking eight minutes of Dracula preamble, and then when it comes time for

994
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,620
the fucking pearl inside the oyster, it switches back to Justin.

995
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,660
Absolutely not, you made this bad.

996
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,620
Here's what we'll do.

997
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,020
Hypnotize-

998
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,620
It won't be Justin, he's dead.

999
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:28,020
Yeah, hypnotize Griffin so he still hears Dracula, and then you can speak in an American

1000
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,660
cadence.

1001
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,980
No, no, he has spoken.

1002
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,740
He has used his will.

1003
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,780
I'm going to go get some water.

1004
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,460
Perhaps for the last time.

1005
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,820
Are you going to kill Griffin?

1006
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,980
Nuggets are on notice.

1007
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,380
Sandwiches be warned and move over.

1008
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:43,940
Tacos.

1009
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:51,620
A donut is now heating up the battle for spicy superiority, proving that the number one brand

1010
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,620
in donuts can rock a spicy side.

1011
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:01,220
Can rock a spicy side?

1012
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,540
I will have silence, or I will have your head.

1013
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:13,780
Duncan has made up one of the most surprising treats ever to rise from its kitchens.

1014
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,820
The new spicy ghost pepper donut.

1015
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,540
Fuck off.

1016
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,900
A deliciously daring donut that delivers the heat with every bite.

1017
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:35,540
This spicy ghost pepper donut is a classic yeast donut topped with a strawberry flavored

1018
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,340
icing that you could easily mistake for...

1019
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,900
Wink-a-wink-a.

1020
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,460
Blub.

1021
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,380
And a bold blend of cayenne and ghost pepper.

1022
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,820
Ghost pepper.

1023
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,380
And finished with red sanding sugar for a sizzling look.

1024
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,620
The spicy ghost pepper donut will be on the menu for only a few hot minutes.

1025
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:09,940
Available beginning today for a limited time at participating Duncan restaurants nationwide

1026
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,380
until December.

1027
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,260
I know this sort of solid baked treats are not really your jam count donut, but

1028
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,700
you think you'd want to tear one of those bad boys down?

1029
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,820
I do not believe so.

1030
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,980
Because it sounds gross?

1031
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,700
Because it sounds yucky?

1032
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,060
No, but I have my guts.

1033
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,060
My guts inside no longer have the...

1034
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,260
I, yes, internal blood syndrome.

1035
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,860
I only can consume and digest blood.

1036
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,660
Okay, so you're not immune to all diseases then?

1037
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,100
It's not a disease to eat something that disagrees with you.

1038
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,540
Well, tell that to Griffin.

1039
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:03,780
If you put mayonnaise into your car's fuel intake and it exploded,

1040
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,780
you wouldn't go to the doctor and say my car is terribly sick.

1041
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,220
Why would I go to the doctor for my car?

1042
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,020
And I might.

1043
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,340
Don't you assume that about me?

1044
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,220
I might do that.

1045
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,340
Well, okay.

1046
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,700
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1047
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,740
If I ate tinfoil and started to cough blood,

1048
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,340
you wouldn't say get away from me.

1049
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,540
I don't want to catch it.

1050
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,900
I'm not sick.

1051
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,940
I would say that there was something wrong with you.

1052
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,660
Halloween looks a little different this year and so do our donuts.

1053
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,420
While our classic bakery offering has plenty of crave-worthy treats,

1054
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,500
we're excited to show our spicy side with a donut that packs a touch of heat

1055
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:52,020
with something sweet and can be enjoyed any time of day.

1056
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,140
The fucking cowardice in that quote where they had to say,

1057
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,260
don't worry, we still have our normal, not disgusting donuts.

1058
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,140
Not spicy items available still.

1059
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,140
With our scary good lineup of the spicy ghost pepper donut,

1060
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,060
Halloween DIY Dunkin' Donut decorating kits,

1061
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,420
and the fan favorite spider donut,

1062
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,260
Dunkin' is here to help our guests keep their Halloween spirit alive.

1063
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,540
Yes, if you're wondering if the opening line,

1064
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,420
Halloween looks a little different this year,

1065
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,980
is a reference to COVID-19 in this press release

1066
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,780
about new donut kinds.

1067
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,940
Yes, that is correct.

1068
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,260
It is wholly inescapable.

1069
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,380
Now hop on my back as I whisk you away to Duck Donuts.

1070
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:43,880
Whee!

1071
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,260
Where the fuck are we going?

1072
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
What's Duck Donuts?

1073
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,580
There's 97 of them.

1074
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,820
It's from the people who brought you Duck Dynasty.

1075
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:53,940
All right.

1076
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,660
I don't know if that is accurate, but I do know this is accurate.

1077
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,340
They've got the Spooky Box.

1078
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:00,900
Excuse me?

1079
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,940
The popular Spooky Box is all about the treats with 12 wonderful,

1080
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,380
colorfully unique flavor and topping combinations

1081
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,820
that are as photogenic as they are scrumptious.

1082
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,540
In a box.

1083
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,380
In the Spooky Box.

1084
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:27,780
In the Spooky Box, it's also the only chance this year

1085
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,300
to try the three limited time flavors,

1086
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,620
pumpkin icing, apple, and streusel topping.

1087
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,860
Not the spookiest.

1088
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,380
I mean, at least the Spooky Box is different.

1089
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,900
The Spooky Box is different.

1090
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,740
The Spooky Box features werewolf,

1091
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,580
which is maple biking with raspberry drizzle.

1092
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,620
How is that wolf?

1093
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,980
Durden worms.

1094
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,060
Chocolate icing with Oreo cookie pieces and gummy worms.

1095
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,140
Blueberry.

1096
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,300
TM, TM, TM.

1097
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,660
TM, TM.

1098
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,420
Blueberry icing with powdered sugar and spider web,

1099
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,940
which is cinnamon sugar with a vanilla drizzle.

1100
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,460
Ross DiGiulio, founder and CEO of Duck Donuts.

1101
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,900
I thought that was another flavor.

1102
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:22,340
And also we have, back by popular demand, Ross DiGiulio.

1103
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,020
We have found and crowned up another Ross DiGiulio.

1104
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,420
If you or someone you know is a Ross DiGiulio,

1105
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,820
please do the right moral thing and submit your body to us

1106
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,900
so that all may enjoy.

1107
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,820
The sixth flavor.

1108
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,460
Maybe just a few nails.

1109
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,020
Your hair clippings, Ross, please, we crave you.

1110
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,460
The most craveable Ross DiGiulio of the year is back.

1111
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,500
No, here he says,

1112
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,500
our Spooky Box is a joyful and giftable collection of delicious fun.

1113
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,420
That's right.

1114
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,060
Giftable.

1115
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,060
If you give it away, you will not be arrested.

1116
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,220
It's served warm and ready for sharing.

1117
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,900
We all need something to look forward to right now.

1118
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,740
So yes, that's right.

1119
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,300
Our second reference to the COVID-19 crisis

1120
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,020
in an announcement about Halloween donuts.

1121
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,580
Thank you so much for reminding me about the ongoing pandemic.

1122
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,340
So appreciated.

1123
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,060
And thank God it's all fixed now because of your delicious Spooky Box.

1124
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,420
The Spooky Box really balances the whole thing out, doesn't it?

1125
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,060
Yeah.

1126
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,620
We all need something to look forward to right now.

1127
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,220
And the fun of Halloween can come soon enough.

1128
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,260
Bon appetit, boos and ghouls.

1129
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Wow, fuck yeah.

1130
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,740
Do you think Russ said that out loud with his human mouth?

1131
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,980
Or do you think that's just something he said like,

1132
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,860
and then at the end you can write like, bon appetit.

1133
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,940
Russ, Russ, he did a terrible pun

1134
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,100
and reinforced the imaginary gender binary.

1135
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,820
What?

1136
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,220
Now I really trusted you, I have decided.

1137
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,100
Oh man, man, Count Donut, I doubted your skills

1138
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,900
when you first showed up, didn't know what your name was.

1139
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,020
But I gotta say you knocked it out of the park with these.

1140
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,380
Thank you so much.

1141
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,660
So what's next?

1142
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,380
Well, can you reanimate Justin's dead ass?

1143
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,020
He's dead.

1144
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,740
Can you emulate Justin?

1145
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,420
I'm sorry?

1146
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,500
Emulate him, like you beat him?

1147
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,260
Oh, sure, sure, of course.

1148
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,980
A woodworking Disney world.

1149
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,820
Good one, Count Donut.

1150
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,580
No dice, no.

1151
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,180
I love sleep no more.

1152
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,540
Sorry, I can't.

1153
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,140
Oh man, Justin has a family.

1154
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,420
I mean us, but.

1155
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,500
Try saying something about FMV games.

1156
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,820
Yeah.

1157
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,940
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

1158
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,620
Sewer shark, it's fun game, good time.

1159
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,420
Cereal, maybe cereals or anything to do with that?

1160
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,020
Oh, I love to crunch with a relaxing bowl of it.

1161
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,020
That was actually pretty good.

1162
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,980
You sound like a mix between Gilbert Gottfried and Olaf.

1163
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,540
Is that what you were going for?

1164
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,860
I have not seen, I do not know if he's Olaf.

1165
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,380
Oh, you haven't seen Frozen?

1166
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,460
No, I've seen Frozen and I don't know Gilbert Gottfried.

1167
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,340
Oh, of course.

1168
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,300
You haven't seen Aladdin?

1169
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,980
I have seen Aladdin live action.

1170
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,740
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1171
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,940
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1172
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,580
Can you say something about A Big Beautiful Buick Enclave?

1173
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,540
Justin loves them.

1174
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,900
A Big Beautiful Buick Enclave.

1175
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,700
Oh, God.

1176
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,300
That sounded great.

1177
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,180
Thank you.

1178
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,660
All right.

1179
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,620
See, it's better.

1180
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,940
It is an improvement.

1181
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,260
No, yeah, everything you're doing today is better.

1182
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,820
How about, why don't you Count Donut take us into our housekeeping?

1183
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:02,820
Of course, although I have help with that around the castle.

1184
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,940
Yes, of course.

1185
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,140
Yes, of course.

1186
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,460
I could have Renfield do the housekeeping for you if you would like.

1187
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

1188
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,420
Doesn't he sound more like Justin?

1189
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,540
That's a pass.

1190
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,020
That's a hard pass.

1191
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,020
My brother, my brother and me is an advice.

1192
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:28,740
Oh, and we so appreciate you listening to the master and these two other cattle.

1193
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,820
Wow, hey, Renfield, fuck you.

1194
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,860
Yeah, well, I'll get the cows back, of course.

1195
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,340
I'm so sorry.

1196
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,460
That dude sucks.

1197
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,660
I agree.

1198
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,740
I told him not to refer to you as cattle to your face.

1199
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,740
I want you to kill him.

1200
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,700
No, hold on, hold on.

1201
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,380
He's dead.

1202
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:58,180
I've put him on top of Justin's body in a way that would make Joey very uncomfortable.

1203
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,020
I get it, that's very funny.

1204
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,580
Thank you.

1205
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:06,820
Hey, Count, there's a podcast my wife and I are doing called Bake On where we talk about

1206
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,900
the new season of Great British Bake Off.

1207
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,780
We got three episodes out now.

1208
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,500
It's on your Podcatcher as well as on our YouTube channel.

1209
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,340
Do you think you'd want to check that out?

1210
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,620
I would love to.

1211
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,220
I'm more of a fan of video games, though.

1212
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,540
And I love to listen to Justin's podcast, The Best Things on Spotify.

1213
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,740
You should have thought about that before you did kill him.

1214
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,620
It's better now.

1215
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,020
Now I get to enjoy at least 25% more Russ Frushtick.

1216
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,740
At least.

1217
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,900
It's Griffin, it's Russ, and it's Chris Plant talking about video games.

1218
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,100
It used to be Justin in there too, but of course now he is drained.

1219
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,740
Dead.

1220
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,940
Yeah, of course.

1221
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,340
It's on Spotify.

1222
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,460
It's very good, I love it.

1223
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,020
Count Donut, do you mind if I talk about all of the merch?

1224
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,180
Because the thought of you, there's a lot.

1225
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,100
And the thought of you taking the sort of time you would need to talk about all of it

1226
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,060
scares me a lot.

1227
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,260
Can you, can I at least talk about the jump scare pin?

1228
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,300
Yeah, that's appropriate.

1229
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:14,180
There is a pin of Justin doing offensive fang face of me, Count Donutula.

1230
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,260
I regret allowing you to do that.

1231
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:23,300
The jump scare pin, and you can purchase it if you want to reinforce some truly harmful

1232
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,380
stereotypes about my kind.

1233
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,700
There's so much stuff at the McElroy merch site, which is McElroymerch.com.

1234
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,620
There is, God I wish Justin was alive to talk about the horseshoe crab shirt.

1235
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:44,260
Yes, his medical podcast with his wife, sorry, Vito Sidney,

1236
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:50,500
right, celebrating horseshoe crabs and their incredible contribution to vaccines.

1237
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,500
Yeah, did you know about this?

1238
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,940
No, I didn't know about that.

1239
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:03,540
You can test for impurities in vaccines if you are using the blood,

1240
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,540
dried blood of a horseshoe crab.

1241
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,180
That's exciting news, I'll make sure to do that.

1242
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,540
It coagulates, so sorry, I'm getting hungry now, listen to me.

1243
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,940
You feed on horseshoe crab blood?

1244
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,540
Just blood in general.

1245
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:21,220
There's also a tiger on the table pin of the month, which was designed by Sam Schultz,

1246
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:26,340
and sales of that benefit the Marsha P. Johnson Institute and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

1247
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,860
There is Candlenights ornaments designed by Lynn Doyle.

1248
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,420
There is Candlenights wrapping paper designed by Justin Gray.

1249
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,420
There's a thanks for vibing and keeping it tight shirt, which I still need to get one of,

1250
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,860
because they're one of my favorite pieces of merch we've ever put up on the store.

1251
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:48,660
And a portion of the proceeds for the shirt will go to the Young Center for Immigrant Children's

1252
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:55,060
Rights. And yeah, that's all at McRoyMerch.com. There's a lot of stuff.

1253
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,100
Okay, a couple quick things. We're doing a live stream of the game Among Us on Tuesday,

1254
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,780
the 20th at 9pm Eastern Time. It's going to be on our McRoy Family channel.

1255
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,740
It's me and the brothers and probably other family members, so make sure you check that out.

1256
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,540
Like we said earlier, we wrote a podcast how-to book called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

1257
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,460
It's available for pre-order now. It'll give you a step-by-step guide to make a show that

1258
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:23,300
you're proud of. You can pre-order that at themacroypodcastbook.com. It comes out January 26th.

1261
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,300

1262
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,300
departure off the album putting the days to bed. Thanks to Maximum Fun. And thank you to Count

1263
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,220
Donut again for- Of course, it was my honor. I'm sorry about your brother. It was time.

1264
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,860
Although it seemed like more of a business relationship at this point. That's fine.

1265
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,940
We both have a spare still. Yeah, and you're doing better than he did really,

1266
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,020
so it might be an improvement. Thank you.

1267
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:05,540
Here's another Yahoo sent in by Merritt Palmer, the prospector. Thank you, Merritt.

1268
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:10,020
What happened? Oh, man, he's not dead. There's this guy on top of me.

1269
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,700
Oh, that's Count Donut. He's like Dracula, but for donuts.

1270
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,060
And the guy on top of you is a dead Renfield. Well, I guess

1271
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,700
Justin's alive, so you don't need to tweet at him about this segment.

1272
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:30,660
All right. Or condolences to his wife that without context will seem extremely disturbing.

1273
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,700
But if you do have anything, you can just tweet at Count Donut.

1274
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:43,220
Yeah, that's going to be somebody that we have no quality control on. Big ups to Trav.

1275
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,020
Anyway, Merritt sent this in. Thanks, Merritt. It's Yahoo Answers user Ramiro who asks.

1276
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,580
And I'm going to read the question and the additional details because it's important.

1277
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:56,020
John Travolta dancing in Pulp Fiction. How well did he do on a scale of one to five?

1278
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,500
I give him a four. He seems like he gave it a good effort and had a fun time,

1279
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,420
but maybe you feel otherwise.

1280
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,820
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

1281
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,860
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm fucking five. Oh, my God.

1282
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,980
Oh, really? I want to say this.

1283
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:22,580
Really? I want to say this. Kiss your dad's grown lips.
