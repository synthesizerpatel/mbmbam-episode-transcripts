1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,080
era. Griffin, it's the most wonderful time of the year because it's time to pay the piper.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:04,960
Hmmmm. Bill's come due. Chuckle Bill has come due. You're not talking about the tax burden,

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,840
the remarkable tax burden. Yeah, your ha ha tax. I'm confused. Who's Chuckle Bill?

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Travis, for every chuckle that we distribute, we have to then pay to the American government

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,520
for 25% based on our tax bracket. Actually, they get 25% of our gefahs? We increased our chortles

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,200
by a significant amount this year, I would say, just based on how the show has grown,

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,640
and now we have to pay back 35%. Wow. Our last bracket is through the roof, and this is the

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,720
one time of year where we come to you and we're just like, open them up. Open them up. Let me see

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,040
them wallets. Open up the wallets. Let me dig around in there, and when I'm done, you will know.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,840
This wallet. Cause I'm gonna wreck your wallet. What is in this wallet? Is this a diner's club

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,960
card? Oh, this wallet smells awful, but the money's good. Oh man, it spins. It may smell like

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,440
an old man's sock drawer, but it spins just right. On a different note, while you guys are thinking

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,000
about wallets, think about why you kept that fortune cookie fortune, cause it's not as funny

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,080
as you think it is. On the subjects of wallets, I ain't trying to discriminate. Let's see those

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,160
purses too. Ladies, pop them open. Pop them open, flip it upside down, shake it out, and let's just

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:40,800
see. I'll take your crystal light powder that you mix with water. I don't care. I need a refreshing

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:49,520
beverage on the go. The tax is due. It's Max Fun Drive 2012. I'm excited because we get to record

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,760
a lot of extra stuff for people who keep this network going, and this is the one time of year

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,520
that we asked you guys to help us keep it running. I'm excited because we are just fucking running on

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:14,560
fumes over here. I've had nothing to eat for the past four days except for saltines and saltine

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,480
water, which is when I crumble up saltines into water and make like a protein slurry.

27
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,840
With no protein, it's really not a good nutritional option. So this is the Max Fun Drive

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,320
2012. Of course, you can go right now to maximumfun.com. It's not maximumfun.com.

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,120
Maximumfun.org. It's okay. I've only been here for a year and a half. Do you guys remember

30
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,520
back when we joined the Max Fun and we were so happy? We used to be the new kid on the block.

31
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Last year, we were the new baby, the new face, but now we are the wizened older brother to

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,600
throwing shade and technically international waters. I think we're adopted, guys. I'm

33
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,320
worried we might be adopted. Have you noticed how we don't look anything like Jesse? We don't dress

34
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,840
as well or anything. He's very tall. We are all, I would say, stocky. Stocky is fair. Hey, let's

35
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,160
get into some advice. Well, let's introduce ourselves first, maybe. Oh, hey, fuck. I'm

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,640
Justin McElroy. I'm your rich uncle, Justin McElroy. If you need to see more, open them up.

37
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm your upper middle class brother, Travis McElroy. I am the one percent but on the bottom

38
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:44,560
part of Griffin. Griffin is the other end of the bell curve. This is our advice show. We'll talk

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,000
more about Max Fun Drive here in a second, but first, let's get to some advice. First question

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
comes in to us from Confused in Calgary who asks, I am going to be moving to a town in the Arctic

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,240
this summer and in the Arctic, there we go, in the Arctic this summer and I don't have enough

42
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,880
room for all my stuff. I'm only going up there for a few months and I have storage space lined up for

43
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,120
everything I can't take. How should I prioritize what to bring and what to leave behind? I'm going

44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,160
to be honest, I don't think it's a good like line of goofing, but all I could think is like parkas

45
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,040
and harpoons and that's probably not- I might actually be racist. A little bit, yeah. Oh no.

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah, you might have tapped a vein there. We haven't even fought with Eskimo racism yet.

47
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh man, we're gonna get deep. This is the show to do it too when we're finally asking them for

48
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,360
money. Well, not them. No, I'm asking them specifically for money. Hey, open your wallet

49
00:05:47,360 --> 00:06:01,600
and dip in you it. You dick. All right, idiot. Well, hey, how about this? Don't go there.

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you know how cold it is? Why didn't you come to us for advice when you were like,

51
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,680
hey brothers, thinking about freezing my nuts out for three months. What's the scoop?

52
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Hey brothers, I just saw Grizzly Man followed by Into the Wild and man, I just can't stop thinking

53
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,560
about how I want to go to a cold place and die. Hey brothers, I want to live my very own Terra

54
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,920
Nova with me as Robert Falcon Scott leading an ill-fated band of explorers to the South Pole.

55
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:42,400
Oh Lord, the toes come off in the boot. What can I do? Please help me. Extra toes. Can you pack

56
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,640
extra toes? Brack, bring extra toes. Bring your ticket home when you realize you made a dumb

57
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,360
choice. That's the only thing you need. Extra toes and your ticket home. It's too cold up there. It's

58
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:04,400
not meant for people. It's meant for bears. Native Americans built a bridge in ancient times from Asia

59
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,960
to Alaska so they could hoof it out of there. Now, I'm sorry, Justin. Yes. You do realize they did

60
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,240
not build that bridge, right? It was a natural land bridge. They built a land bridge. What else

61
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,680
were they going to build it out of, Travis? Plexiglass? Of course it's a land bridge.

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
Exactly. You paint with the medium that's given to you and they had a shit ton of land until

63
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,320
we came in and snatched it. Hey Bill, bring some of that land over here. Boy, I bet they wish they

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,680
had not been so wasteful with their land as to build a bridge out of it had they known that we

65
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,200
were going to come for it so hard. I'll be the first to say it. Not a very good bridge because

66
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,600
where's that shit today? Yeah, how's your longevity? Not good? I am sorry to the Native

67
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,840
American people for that. That was fucked up. Everything you said. We really blew it.

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,200
Not the jokes, but what we did. I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't do that today.

69
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm sorry for us. I mean, obviously, whenever I go into any sort of situation where I'm not going

70
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
to have access to all my beautiful things, my baubles that I bought with the money of Max

71
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,840
Fundlisters, the main concern I have is entertainment. What if I'm bored? That's the

72
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,800
terror that keeps me up. And you know what? The amazing thing about our modern age is that you

73
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,360
can do things like the Kindle and laptops and condense all your media and stuff into one tiny

74
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,080
container. Yeah. One single geocache and then hide it in the snow where no one will come for it.

75
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,560
Yeah, that would be my very first thought. Get a Kindle or a Nook or an iPad or whatever.

76
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Can they get a Nanook? Get a Nanook.

77
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Wow. It's one of those shows, huh? What would you guys bring? What would be the first thing

78
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,080
you would pack if you were leaving your home to accidentally go freeze to death?

79
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,640
I would bring a hatchet and a copy of Gary Paulsen's hatchet so I know what to do because

80
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
that kid got out. A-okay. Spoiler. He gets out all right.

81
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,080
I would bring a hatchet hidden inside the book hatchet.

82
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,960
I like it. And you open it up and you get the hatchet out. You say,

83
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,680
okay, what? Ah, my book's a big empty square. Fuck.

84
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
Can't read this.

85
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,480
I will say this as a person who's crazy and has taken every opportunity to own knives and

86
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,720
swords throughout my life. This would be like the time to buy a survival knife

87
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,400
with like some flint in the handle and like a compass and shit. That'd be awesome.

88
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,960
Well, preferably you would buy it before you go to the Arctic.

89
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
I want an authentic. No, I want an authentic Arctic knife.

90
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,200
You're saying step off the boat. Like, where's the knife store? Oh, fuck. Nobody's here. Nobody.

91
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm the only one. It's the Arctic.

92
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,240
Why did I ask them? Why did I ask my brother, my brother,

93
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
me if I should do this? I made such a huge mistake.

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,160
Where is the local Excalibur store? Oh, those don't exist anymore anywhere

95
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
on the planet anyways. Damn it.

96
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,840
By the way, guys, Excalibur is the, it's the name of the, the, the,

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
how would you even describe it?

98
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,760
A sword.

99
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
It's a curio slash weaponry shop.

100
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,160
At the Huntington Mall, you can find Excalibur, which is a store that sells glass baubles.

101
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Like, like I'm talking like porcelain firemen.

102
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,520
It's like glass menagerie shit. Like tiny crystal unicorns.

103
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,960
Well, don't sell them short because they also trade in pewter.

104
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah. Right. Pewter dragons.

105
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
Pewter figurines.

106
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
And knives and swords and throwing knives.

107
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Non-chaku.

108
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
Ninja stars.

109
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah. You can fully go to Excalibur if you're in Huntington.

110
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
Like don't miss it because it's a bananas.

111
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,160
Like we don't have niche stores here because there aren't enough niches to support them,

112
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,160
but they, they will combine two niches like our Mexican pancake place.

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
Flapjack Tanapas.

114
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Also very real. Huntington is really into mashups this year.

115
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,520
Remix.

116
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,720
Have you guys been to the bowler rank, which is like the roller rank only with bowling in it.

117
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,880
So while it's, it's, it's well, but I mean, a ship in harbor, you know.

118
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
Griffin, how about you hit me with a yahoo?

119
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
Sure. This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

120
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
Thank you, Lisa.

121
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,920
It is by yahoo answers user EK who asks, is being called thick an insult or compliment?

122
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
I am five foot seven and 140 pounds.

123
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,400
This guy called me thick saying he liked it, but all I hear from that is fat.

124
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,520
I do have a donk large booty and muscular thighs,

125
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,680
but I have no curves in my boobs and not really large hips.

126
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
So is being called thick a compliment or insult?

127
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,640
I simply can't do this.

128
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,920
I can't Griffin.

129
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
I'm trying to stay posy.

130
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm trying to march into positivity this.

131
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
I have been the entire time you were reading that question.

132
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,640
I was trying to, in my mind, formulate a sentence in which thick could be said in a complimentary

133
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,960
way.

134
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm going to go.

135
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,800
You know what?

136
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,400
I think it's complimentary.

137
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,280
Yeah, say it, say it and use it in a sentence.

138
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
Travis, you're a real thick guy.

139
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,520
Nope.

140
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
Let me try that.

141
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,000
Let me try that.

142
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
You kind of look like Alan Thicke.

143
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, that's pretty good, right?

144
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Uh huh.

145
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Listen, thick could mean that like the stuff of which you are constituted is is rigid.

146
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,160
You know, it's like commenting on my density.

147
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Yeah, you can't be you can't be just blown over, you know, and you can't be swayed because

148
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,080
you're you're made from from really hardy stock.

149
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
Yeah, you're viscous.

150
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,560
You're you're sturdy, sturdy.

151
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,440
That's good.

152
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
Reinforced.

153
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,080
You are a reinforced person.

154
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,480
You're like a McDonald's triple thick milkshake and you're like you get it and you're like,

155
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,960
oh, great.

156
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm really going to enjoy this in 30 minutes when it's right when it's sippable through

157
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,680
the straw.

158
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
You are like right when it comes out the window.

159
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
I see fresh out the window.

160
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,880
When you were just reading that letter, I had a I sort of had this like an animated

161
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,360
character in my mind that was that was supposed to change its appearance as you read the

162
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
descriptions because I was building a mental picture.

163
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,080
Sure.

164
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
It just started at one and just kind of stayed there like, oh, OK.

165
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,080
Yeah, you look like that.

166
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,920
That's that's understandable.

167
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Maybe you have other gifts.

168
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,080
Maybe maybe these aren't the gifts you should worry about.

169
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,680
Is it possible this person is a dollar and that's what the person meant?

170
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
Like you're thick.

171
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, obviously.

172
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
Well, but the guy said he liked it.

173
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,680
So like I like you're so fucking dumb and I love it.

174
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
I love you for it.

175
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,160
You do have a donk large booty and I can't.

176
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
I do love your donk large booty.

177
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,280
What does that mean?

178
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't know.

179
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,280
I have that's like that's like the Starbucks size above Venti.

180
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,600
She didn't hyphenate.

181
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
She didn't have a donk large mocha frap.

182
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I almost wish that she had hyphenated donk large as if donk was a modifier for large.

183
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,120
And then I could use that term to describe other things like what?

184
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,520
So is it donk large and donk medium and donk small or is just donk height in the adjective?

185
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,280
So it's like, man, I'm donk thirsty.

186
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,520
Yeah.

187
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,160
I don't think anything can be donk small.

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,160
Yeah, no, pretty sure.

189
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Well, except I wish that were true.

190
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
That would that would mean a lot to my marital happiness.

191
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Wait, why?

192
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,280
What?

193
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,160
Because he's my dog.

194
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
Because my dog's small.

195
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,840
What do you mean?

196
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
Donk like you can't.

197
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
I just invented a new nomenclature for the gag.

198
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
So when you say donk, you're either referring to your butt or your penis.

199
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,040
Yes.

200
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,680
So if donk became penis, it changes the song honky tonk but donk donk to a whole new level.

201
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, it's a really weird.

202
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
Honky tonk but penis but penis.

203
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
That hit song that he has.

204
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Oh, girl.

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Girl, you have many strengths.

206
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
You literally have a lot of I mean, just just pure leg strength.

207
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,880
Just pure.

208
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,520
I bet you're really good at like lifting things.

209
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,480
Powerlifting.

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,760
You have that going for you.

211
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
You're not very good at finding online forums to ask questions in because you pick the worst one.

212
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
But that that that can't stop you.

213
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't slow down.

214
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,720
Is saying someone has lifter's legs a compliment?

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,200
If I call a lady sturdy, is that all right?

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
That's not all right.

217
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
No, no, it's not all right.

218
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
Sturdy sounds like a phrase you use to describe a woman in the Dust Bowl.

219
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
Oh, she said she's a she's a hardy woman.

220
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
Hardy stock in her Hardy stock.

221
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm going to go buy her a larder of Calico.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,440
She is Hardy.

223
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,760
Hey, if I if I want to buy a larder Calico, the only way I'm going to do it is by the support

224
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,080
of Max fun listeners for Max fun drive.

225
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,600
I know you guys are dying to hear about it.

226
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's let's pop it off.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,720
Griffin, give me the big pitch before we get into specifics.

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Why do we do this?

229
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,280
We do it.

230
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
It's not just us.

231
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
When you when you support us for the Max fund drive, you're supporting us.

232
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
You're supporting Jordan, Jesse, go just John Hodgman.

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
Stop podcasting yourself throwing shade.

234
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,440
All these these great programs that are totally free on the Max fund network, which are funded.

235
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,480
I would say only slightly by the promotions and money zone stuff that we do, but like

236
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:06,160
like almost all of it comes from listener donations, which is unbelievably radical.

237
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,240
Since we joined the network last year and started getting the donations from the Max

238
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,600
fund drive, we've been able to grow and do live shows and add more podcasts to the network.

239
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,800
So so that is why we do it.

240
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,960
We really appreciate your support.

241
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,560
Here is how it works.

242
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:34,240
You go to maximum fun dot org forward slash donate and you're going to have a few different

243
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,040
options there for for your donation.

244
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,600
Our lowest level, which is is just our least expensive level, it no in no way changes how

245
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,840
much we care about you for for making this choice is five dollars.

246
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,760
And that's all I mean, five dollars a month.

247
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,960
And you can do something really great for well for us and also for yourself because

248
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
you're helping to support great stuff.

249
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,160
Travis, obviously, when someone donates, they're going to get the gift of entertainment.

250
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
They're going to get the gift of feeling good about themselves.

251
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
What else can we offer them?

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,360
Well, at some of the beginning levels, five dollars a month, the biggest thing you get

253
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,040
you get bonus episodes.

254
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,400
So you get access to content that nobody else gets to see.

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,560
You're going to get special episodes with Jordan, Jesse Goh, Judge John Hodgman, Stop

256
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,960
Podcasting Yourself, My Brother, My Brother and Me and the new one, Throwing Shade, along

257
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,960
with three Rift movies where we take some of like the old, you know, educational films

258
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
and just mock them.

259
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,680
You you will you will want to hear our bonus episode.

260
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah, it's a special episode has a super special guest at the ten dollar level.

261
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
You'll receive Max Fund Friendship bracelets.

262
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
Bracelets along with all the content.

263
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,120
You'll get the friendship bracelet and it's a way to show the world that you're a friend

264
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,920
to Max Fund.

265
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,360
It's like when you wear a carnation on a date, you will be able to recognize rad people

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
by just by one glance at their wrist.

267
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,400
Think of it as like a w w m b m b a m d bracelet.

268
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,040
A j j go a j j h o.

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
Keep all those characters in your head at once.

270
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,160
That's so these thank you gifts apply only to new monthly donors.

271
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,560
If you're a recurring member whom we love so very much, you're still going to get the

272
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,360
bonus content.

273
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
And if you're at the ten dollar level or above, you're still going to get the the Max Fund

274
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Friendship bracelet.

275
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,520
But for all of the levels that are higher, you will need to increase your monthly membership

276
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
level to get those thank you gifts.

277
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,520
I really like maximum fun.

278
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,480
I love m b m b a m.

279
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
I love throwing shade the new program.

280
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
I want to I want to give twenty dollars, thirty five dollars.

281
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,280
I can do that.

282
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
Well, let me throw this phrase out to you, Justin.

283
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,080
The Diamond Friendship Circle.

284
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,880
Diamonds are the best gym that there is.

285
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,040
You can join the Diamond Friendship Circle and you'll receive a shiny new stainless steel

286
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,360
water bottle and a handy on the go size screen printed with our simple and tasteful rocket

287
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,160
logo.

288
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,680
You also get the friendship bracelet, all the content, the rift tracks.

289
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Let's go back to the comedy for a little while.

290
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,720
And then after that, we're going to talk about the thirty five dollar level.

291
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
And it's really going to take it's really going to take your breath away.

292
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Oh, it'll be like that, like an audible gasp.

293
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,000
You can read about all of the donation levels and gifts and everything you get for supporting

294
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,040
us at Maximum Fund dot org slash donate.

295
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,160
Please go check it out.

296
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,560
We really do need your help to keep growing the show.

297
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,120
And we really appreciate it.

298
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,800
What's the best way to inquire to a potential employer about a job?

299
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,040
I am doing everything I can think of to get this potential employer's attention and make

300
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,440
me a valuable asset for the company in the future.

301
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,160
How often is too often to inquire?

302
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,320
I just do not want to be forgotten.

303
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,920
This particular job is something that would revolutionize my life.

304
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,840
It is something I would want to put my all into.

305
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
That's from Aaron in New Zealand.

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,720
I think we were raised every time that I ever applied for a job or anything.

307
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,960
Mom and Dad always encouraged me to like call, you know, and check and be like, hey, so I

308
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,320
was just following up on my application and resume and whatnot.

309
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
Now, that being said, eventually, when I became the person that was interviewing people for

310
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,160
jobs, I hate that shit.

311
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah, God bless it.

312
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,120
It's so terrible, especially when they call like the next day and you're like, I haven't

313
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
even thought about you in 12 hours.

314
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,560
Give me some time.

315
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,520
The fact is, the fact of the matter is, you got to make that big first impression.

316
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
You don't get another chance if you make the right first impression.

317
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,680
And I'm not talking with a cold application.

318
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm talking about, you know, with an interview or whatever.

319
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,160
You got to make that big first impression because if you do it right, it'll make that

320
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,720
person, they won't be able to stop thinking about you.

321
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
It'll be all they think about.

322
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,400
They'll want you to come over and braid hair and stuff.

323
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,680
You got to get that first impression rose, which is, of course, the rose that you get

324
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,600
on the first episode of The Bachelor.

325
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,640
We can't talk about The Bachelor anymore.

326
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,560
Before he fucking like talks to, this is what I love about his show, before that dude talks

327
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,080
to anyone on any substantial level, he gives someone a rose like, yeah, you can stick around,

328
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,800
just based on like how they hit him, how the light catches them when he first sees them.

329
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,600
Like, ah, yeah, she'll do.

330
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
She'll, yeah, she's great.

331
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,400
I love her.

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
She's a sturdy woman.

333
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
She came in on a horse.

334
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,400
She could stay.

335
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,040
They do something similar on Flavor of Love, except Flavor Flav does a can of beans in

336
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,360
her face.

337
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,560
It's not a classy show.

338
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,320
It's my first impression, beans.

339
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Please help me be relevant.

340
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
I'm forever slipping over that press.

341
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,520
That show has been on in the last five years, right?

342
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
I think it's still being recorded.

343
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
It's just not airing anymore.

344
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,040
It's just called his life now.

345
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,800
It's just his day to day.

346
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,960
I mean, I think one follow up is like, you should be able to get a pretty good vibe from

347
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,200
it.

348
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,560
If they're stalling you, then I think that, yeah, but I think it should be the same as

349
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,760
like the getting a girl's number, getting a guy's number.

350
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,400
It's like, don't call like that day or the next day because it's probably an interview

351
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
process where they're interviewing more than one person for the job.

352
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,000
So they're probably not all taking place on the same day.

353
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,560
So give it like four or five days.

354
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,240
Why don't you watch the TV show The Pickup Artist and then use the skills that you learned

355
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
from that show on your potential employer?

356
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,560
You know, Griffin, you joke.

357
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,680
But as someone that's interviewed like countless people.

358
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
You like to be seduced.

359
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,720
Interview skills have so much to do with that.

360
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,080
It's the personality, eye contact, being engaged, you know, like answering the questions that's

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
asked you, being prepared, all of that dressing the part.

362
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
Don't roll up in jeans and a t-shirt.

363
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,200
Yeah, that's actually really important.

364
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,080
Don't go, don't go turn in a job application if you're not dressed classy.

365
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,880
Just like a gentleman.

366
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
But don't overdress either if you're going to like a retail establishment and you wear

367
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,560
like a suit and tie, the people are going to think you're making fun of them.

368
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,960
That is the first thing they tell you on The Pickup Artist.

369
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,280
Dress over but not under, but not too over.

370
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,600
I think it's like, it's sort of like with sales or anything.

371
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,320
Don't check in just to sort of keep yourself top of mind.

372
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
Check in with an intention.

373
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,040
Check in and say like, I'm going to move this process forward.

374
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,920
Process forward or die trying.

375
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,120
So don't call and say like, Hey, I just want to remind you I'm alive.

376
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,360
I wanted to call and get this interview.

377
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
Let's get this set up.

378
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Cause I know you want to move on this with me.

379
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
I know you're into this as much as I am.

380
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,600
Cause if you show that kind of enthusiasm that says like, Hey, let's book this job.

381
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,240
Let's do this.

382
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,640
I like it.

383
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,720
You're looking thick in those jeans.

384
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
Who's your friend?

385
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm not interested in you anymore, but now I am.

386
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,440
You want to drink?

387
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,920
Come here.

388
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,560
Is that a direct quote from the pickup artist, Griffin?

389
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,320
That's actually the poster catchphrase.

390
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,520
How is that a gift?

391
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
What is on the poster?

392
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
You look thick in those jeans.

393
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
Who's your friend?

394
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm bored with you now.

395
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,840
Now I'm not.

396
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
You want to drink?

397
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
Come here now.

398
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
Eight o'clock on a TV.

399
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,800
Mystery.

400
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,120
Mystery.

401
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,600
Come get it.

402
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Pickup artist.

403
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
Have you seen the hat that guy wears?

404
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
It's the best hat.

405
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,960
You got an Excalibur.

406
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,320
It's true.

407
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

408
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah.

409
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
This Yahoo was sent in by Catherine Burgess.

410
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,280
Thank you, Catherine.

411
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Waldo, who asks,

412
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
is it possible to marry someone without them knowing?

413
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, no.

414
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,680
Like get them to sign a paper saying you're married without them actually being aware

415
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,520
you're actually getting married.

416
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
What if you've actually never met this person?

417
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,200
I want to marry Liam Payne from One Direction, but I've never actually met him before.

418
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,760
And if I ever do meet him, could I have him sign like an autograph that's actually marriage

419
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,320
papers?

420
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,640
How?

421
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,920
Also, how do you cure a phobia of spoons?

422
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,640
What?

423
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
Additional details.

424
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
I don't have a fear of spoons.

425
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,400
It's Liam's phobia, duh.

426
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
I think maybe if I can help him cure this, then he'll marry me.

427
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
Also, congrats on your marriage to Neil Patrick Harris.

428
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,600
I heard he's gay now.

429
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,260
What?

430
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,620
Who hold?

431
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,460
Wait.

432
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,180
I don't know where to start.

433
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,940
There's so much going on.

434
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,660
There's so many.

435
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,820
First off, who is Liam Payne?

436
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,020
Who was One Direction?

437
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,580
Is that the fucking Glee Club on Glee?

438
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,380
Oh, wait.

439
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,020
No way.

440
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,580
Is it?

441
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,380
No, no, no, no.

442
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,820
It's a British boy band.

443
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,940
Oh, thank God.

444
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,900
Wait, is that better?

445
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,780
It's like take that or the Beatles.

446
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,620
These guys are the famousest and I've never heard of them.

447
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,940
How famous are they?

448
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,060
Can't be that famous.

449
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,820
Is it spelled right?

450
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,220
Or is it spelled like w-o-n-d-i-r-e-z something?

451
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,460
Guys, you guys are my metric for this stuff though.

452
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Like I'm 31 years old.

453
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,340
If something's huge and I haven't heard of it, I'm out.

454
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,540
I'm out the game.

455
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,460
There's five of these little creeps.

456
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,380
And there is a Daily Mail article that the headline for which is

457
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,260
One Direction to have 20 bodyguards each for their Dallas performance.

458
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,500
And it only lasts 45 minutes.

459
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,940
That's not a very good headline though.

460
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,780
These fools look like they're like 12.

461
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,580
They've got 20 fucking bodyguards each.

462
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,540
And they've all got to learn the dances.

463
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,420
This is ridiculous.

464
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,300
It's the tough part.

465
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,260
So this girl wants to marry.

466
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,260
Let's just say Davy Jones so I can wrap my mind around it.

467
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,500
Well, a live Davy Jones in his prime.

468
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,140
Okay, okay.

469
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,060
She wants to marry a live.

470
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,660
That's something from my time period.

471
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,500
So I can relate to wants to marry leave leave Gallagher.

472
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,580
Is that like I leave Garrett?

473
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,020
I love you leave Garrett.

474
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
I love you leave Garrett.

475
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,740
I'm sorry you are so bummed about spoons.

476
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm not crazy about them either.

477
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,700
Can we get some sports up in here?

478
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,820
Like I will never serve you soup till death do us part.

479
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,540
I promise.

480
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,420
I love you.

481
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,060
You are missing the best part of this question.

482
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,740
What is that?

483
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,220
The vehicle, the mode, the method,

484
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,100
which this person could take to get a signature on a marriage license.

485
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,740
You're right.

486
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,060
You're right there.

487
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,660
I mean, I need you to sign for this package.

488
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,740
You can do the classic full house,

489
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:54,260
like scoot up the front page on the science fair form, you know,

490
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,380
and then they sign it.

491
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,460
It's like, oh, field trip to Rome.

492
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,380
Like, that's a good one.

493
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,260
Come on, Comet.

494
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,320
Bye.

495
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,600
Ciao.

496
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,060
I'm riding you out of here, Comet.

497
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,100
I pretended, by the way, just now that Comet was a luck dragon.

498
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,740
Sorry.

499
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,900
You can't trick someone into marrying you, Baba Yaga.

500
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,500
That's not how that shit works.

501
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,660
You trickster.

502
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,820
You knave.

503
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,940
What sound would that person make if it worked?

504
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,860
Would it just be like an audible sort of, whoop, we're married.

505
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,380
Wait, the person who's been tricked or the trickster?

506
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,620
Oh, the trickster.

507
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,980
The person who's been tricked is into indentured servitude for the rest of his life.

508
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,260
She would probably just yell like, I'm your wife now.

509
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,620
And then one of these fools, 20 bodyguards would murder her.

510
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,140
Just like, take the shot right there.

511
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,460
And then he would be a very young popular widow.

512
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,180
Popular widow.

513
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,060
I'm the most famous widow that there is.

514
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,300
The only way you can separate yourself from the rest of new direction choices,

515
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,140
the rest of their bodyguards, is by killing a fan that gets out of line.

516
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,540
Because people are going to remember that kind of dedication.

517
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,620
That's why you carry one of them out.

518
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,380
You think this is the first time this has happened?

519
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,420
A bodyguard killed a fan?

520
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,620
No, I think it happens a lot.

521
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,220
No, I mean secret marriage.

522
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,300
A secret, a fan gets a secret marriage.

523
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,460
Do you know Justin Timberlake is like fucking Cody from Sister Wives?

524
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,620
Because he's got like 20 secret wives.

525
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,780
And that fool will sign anything.

526
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,380
Yeah, sign anything for you.

527
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,100
JT, you have to stop signing things.

528
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,540
Why would you, why would you get to sign a baseball card?

529
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,820
You don't even play baseball.

530
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,700
What are you doing?

531
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,540
I saw these people in my house.

532
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,900
I signed it away.

533
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,300
Nope, just getting punked by my good friend Ashton Kutcher.

534
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,780
That was a real episode.

535
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,100
That, what?

536
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,460
That was a real episode of punk.

537
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,740
Did he sign his, did he sign his, signed a fake wedding?

538
00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,180
No, he's, I think, uh, uh, a coach, uh, just rolled up in, in J Tim's house.

539
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,820
And like, it started like taking all his shit away.

540
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,780
And he's like, it's fine, man.

541
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,740
You got repossessed.

542
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,460
It's not, it's not really germane.

543
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,180
Let's move on.

544
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,020
No, no, Griffin, continue.

545
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,220
How's the girl play out?

546
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,740
By all means.

547
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,180
Yeah, he's like, no, I don't hate.

548
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,900
That's my car.

549
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,980
And he takes his car and I gotcha sign this.

550
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,780
That was the name of the show on MTV at eight coaches.

551
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,340
I gotcha.

552
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,180
Sign this, sign this, sign this, please.

553
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,100
They're, they probably actually did have to sign his affidavit.

554
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:38,980
Oops.

555
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,780
We're married.

556
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,580
Gotcha.

557
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,220
Again.

558
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,940
Sign this now.

559
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,300
Sign another affidavit.

560
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,380
Why does he keep falling for it?

561
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,100
That's my question.

562
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,540
He's not very smart.

563
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,340
No, but God damn, he can dance and act.

564
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,140
And well, dance and sing and sing.

565
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,820
He's a triple threat.

566
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,460
Stop signing.

567
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,420
Stop signing shit.

568
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,060
He can't be legally, fiscally responsible.

569
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,660
That's why he's his own, um, he has lost his own power of attorney.

570
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,820
He actually cannot sign any, it's not legally binding.

571
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,860
If he signs it, it has to be his manager, Lou Pearlman.

572
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,980
I don't, uh, what?

573
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,020
No, go on.

574
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,420
You're right.

575
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,060
No, no, you're right about everything you just said.

576
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,300
Hey guys, how do I break up with my D and D party?

577
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm really busy and I haven't been having much fun lately.

578
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,940
I like my friends.

579
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,060
My dwarf is kind of a big part of the party, but I don't have the time to play.

580
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
And I don't know how to end it.

581
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,940
Please help.

582
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,140
And that's from Badkins.

583
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,740
Hi, Badkins.

584
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,220
Hello, Badkins.

585
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,700
First off, Badkins, why don't you invite me to your group?

586
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm in Huntington.

587
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,540
You're in Huntington.

588
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,340
Let's do this.

589
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,420
Let's quest.

590
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,100
Let's quest together.

591
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,140
Badkins, the answer is so obvious.

592
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,980
It's right in front of your face.

593
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,740
It is time for your dwarf to start playing fast and move.

594
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,660
That's exactly what I was going to say.

595
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,060
Live like you were dying or want to die.

596
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,660
Is that how that, is that what that song's about?

597
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,900
Have you seen this Jeff Bridges movie Fearless that's been going around lately?

598
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,260
That's the life you're living.

599
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,660
You're just standing on the edge of buildings.

600
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,620
Like anytime there's a dragon, you're like, hey, fuck you.

601
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,340
I'm going to solo it.

602
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,840
Yeah.

603
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:24,740
Eat me up.

604
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,780
Every few minutes.

605
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,500
Every few minutes.

606
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:34,100
And my dwarf wakes up from his bed and wanders off into a cave, bringing no armaments with him.

607
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,220
No, he doesn't.

608
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,660
No, he doesn't, Badkins.

609
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,300
He doesn't.

610
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,140
He doesn't do that.

611
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,300
No, I'm pretty sure he does.

612
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,020
This is what happened.

613
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,060
Or he puts all of his armor on, walks into the lake.

614
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,560
Oops.

615
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,340
Or how about a completely like non-tragic turn where your dwarf retires from adventuring

616
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,820
to start a life as a blacksmith.

617
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,260
And while your group continues to play in the dungeon, you're off playing a separate

618
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,300
game of balancing the books for your blacksmithery.

619
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,660
And trying to keep some food on your family's table.

620
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,100
He's out the game.

621
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,980
He's out the game.

622
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,620
He can't do this anymore.

623
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,580
Dwarf dies of natural causes that you hint at.

624
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,140
My dwarf's brain feels funny.

625
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
My dwarf smells burnt toast.

626
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,140
It's nothing to worry about for a while.

627
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,860
The left side of my dwarf's face is numb.

628
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,260
This is weird.

629
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,940
My dwarf has just gotten a note from the doctor that says it's malignant.

630
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,620
And no, he didn't.

631
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,820
He didn't do that.

632
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm the dungeon master.

633
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,140
You can't just make up notes that your dwarf gets.

634
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
My cleric heals you.

635
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,820
Oh, it's, it's immagicable.

636
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,220
It's immagicable.

637
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,580
My dwarf can't stop peeing.

638
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,380
Is that trouble?

639
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,900
Do I need to see somebody for that?

640
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,940
A magic doctor.

641
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,740
What's that?

642
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,260
You do not actually have doctors?

643
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,060
That's, that's pretty scary.

644
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,100
I guess I'm going to die then.

645
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,020
Then you've got to kill him off.

646
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,180
If you kill him off, then you can't, then he can't be around on the adventures anymore.

647
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,220
That's pretty obvious, right?

648
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,580
But I think the bigger problem is now you can't tell people in your group to listen to our show.

649
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,700
And, and I don't think you really thought about the repercussions first before you did this.

650
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,060
Um, Justin, would you be up for a swap-a-roo?

651
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,420
A swap-a-rooney?

652
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,500
He taps in, he taps out, you tap in.

653
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,980
I will take over as Grizzlethorne Beerbelly or whatever the fuck.

654
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,820
I will be your dwarf now.

655
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,620
I will take over.

656
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,460
You're a sickly, sickly dwarf.

657
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,620
You're a sickly, decrepit disease.

658
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,820
He lost another tooth.

659
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,620
Lost another tooth.

660
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,380
Damn it.

661
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,340
Guys, I have to stop and put on my robe.

662
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,220
It's not magical.

663
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,420
It's just terry cloth.

664
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,620
He's caught a chill.

665
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,540
I've got to chill.

666
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,500
I have to sit down.

667
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,980
Can we, can we rest please?

668
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,660
Can we please just take a break?

669
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm so tired.

670
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Um, the party notices that my dwarf has been having prolonged conversations with people

671
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,580
he cares about and trying to give them things he owns.

672
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,940
Is that, is that a problem?

673
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,460
You hit for one damage again.

674
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,220
What's wrong with your bones?

675
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,340
I'd like to roll to see if the treatment is working.

676
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,060
Oh no.

677
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,100
Nah, critical miss.

678
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:18,900
Bye.

679
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,140
Critical miss.

680
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,700
Just, will you guys just name a sword after me?

681
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,620
Just, just remember me some way.

682
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,500
Keep me in your heart for a while, uh, and just, and wait an appropriate amount of time

683
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,260
before you hire another dwarf, please.

684
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,380
Please.

685
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,340
And now, uh, I'll do the sad hulk walking away music.

686
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,700
I want you guys to remember me as I was, not as I am and not as this disease will make me.

687
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,020
I'm going to go spend some time with my clan.

688
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:53,140
I just had the horrifying realization that this thing we are goofing about is something

689
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,020
that it's probably actually happened in a game of Dungeons and Dragons without, like,

690
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,980
sans goofing.

691
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,820
Like a real, someone tried to work like a natural death in their storyline and, like,

692
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,180
had to, like, act it out to the point where, like, laying on the bed.

693
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,740
Like, I've always loved.

694
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,340
Oh, bye guys.

695
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,020
Oh, my dad's here.

696
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,140
My mom's here, I gotta go.

697
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,220
I have a date, okay?

698
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,500
I have a date.

699
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,300
There, I know.

700
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,980
I've been married for three years.

701
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,580
I can't do this with you fools anymore.

702
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,660
Please remember me as I was and make sure that you take my jewels back to my fake in-game wife.

703
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,740
And save my character sheet and cryogenically freeze my fake body.

704
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
God damn, I miss Dungeons and Dragons.

705
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,340
Yeah, man, it's good.

706
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,140
It's a good time.

707
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,620
Can we start, like, a D&D podcast so I have an excuse to do this every week?

708
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,780
Is this something we can do over the internet?

709
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,140
Let's just turn this dumb show into a weekly D&D session.

710
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,860
We don't need to do advice anymore.

711
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,060
Let's fucking go on a quest.

712
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,820
We can do D&D advice.

713
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,140
Yeah.

714
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,660
That's what our advice roll for initiative.

715
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,620
Hey, we should do that as a bonus episode instead of our current plan.

716
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,820
Or just play D&D together, make people listen to it.

717
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,900
I mean, I got all the stuff if we need it.

718
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
This is getting too close to reality.

719
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,260
I want it to be on reality.

720
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,700
I want it to be on and in it.

721
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,740
Well, let's think about it.

722
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Let's not do anything too hasty.

723
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,220
I don't want to rush into it and then later have to fake my own death.

724
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,340
Oh, shit.

725
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,460
Fake your own death.

726
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,620
Die in the game, fake your death in the game, and then in, like, three months, smash into

727
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,460
a window and be like, what's up?

728
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,020
But smash it through your actual, like, friend's window.

729
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,060
Yeah, right.

730
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,620
No, no, no.

731
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,980
Yeah, absolutely.

732
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,220
But you got to work that out with the DM first.

733
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,340
You got to say, listen, I'm going to fake my own death and I want you to conspire with me.

734
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,500
Well, I'm bumming myself out.

735
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,620
What if I love podcasts, right?

736
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:56,740
Okay.

737
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,620
And I say I have an extra $35 a month that I could donate to those podcasts to help them

738
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,300
out, help keep the funny coming.

739
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,780
What would you give me in exchange for that?

740
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,980
Well, I would make a case that you shouldn't donate to any old podcast.

741
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,100
You should donate to our podcast network, which is maximum fun.

742
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,420
We have described the $5 and $10 and $20 levels.

743
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:30,420
At $35 a month, it is the Judge John Hodgman's Post-Apocalyptic Justice Squad.

744
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,540
For $35 a month, you get all this stuff we talked about before.

745
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,780
You get the stainless steel water bottle.

746
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,820
You get the friendship bracelet.

747
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,380
You get all the donors-only episodes.

748
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,100
Can't vouch for the quality of the rest, but ours is going to be totally dope.

749
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,980
You also get our highly collectible, totally proprietary Friendship Emergency Kit,

750
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:57,140
which includes MaxPhone playing cards, some Mad Libs, which is different from Sad Libs,

751
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,740
two bubblegum cigars, two packets of Alka-Seltzer, two temporary tattoos,

752
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,780
headphone splitters for your friends to share media, a box of Kashi Good Friends

753
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,900
breakfast cereal, best friends' necklaces, and also a half bag of Tonks coffee.

754
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,020
I'm sorry, I read that wrong.

755
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,900
It's Donk Large Coffee.

756
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Yeah, Tonks coffee.

757
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,500
Can you tell me about Tonks, Griffin?

758
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,780
What is Tonks?

759
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,900
I'm not familiar with the brand.

760
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,900
I believe that is one of the wizards in Harry Potter with a lady wizard, right?

761
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,700
Yep, that lady wizard went to make some coffee.

762
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
She is a lady wizard and a cofiteer.

763
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,140
Tonks is a coffee that gets delivered right to you, and it's fresh and delicious, right?

764
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,780
And it's fresh roasted with care, so it's none of that stale stuff that sits on the

765
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,020
shelves at supermarkets forever.

766
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,060
It's fresh roasted.

767
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,060
And it's not that bullshit, that bullshit shit that you put in, it's like a little cup,

768
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,900
and you put the cup in the machine, and then it makes you a bigger cup of coffee.

769
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,780
It makes Christ sad.

770
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,540
And each one is like eight and a half dollars.

771
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,100
Yeah, Tonks is like Netflix, but instead of getting movies in the mail, you get coffee

772
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,660
to do it.

773
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,620
But you get a free half bag of that also.

774
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,060
So it's everything you basically need to survive an Arctic expedition.

775
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,620
And we would really, really, really, the support means so much to us, guys, and it helps us

776
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,020
to do this show and keep it running and do cool stuff like live shows and everything.

777
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,140
And here's the important thing.

778
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,380
When you donate, when you commit, when you support us, make sure that you tell them you're

779
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,700
supporting my brother, my brother and me.

780
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,180
Even if you don't like our show and you like the other shows better, we are Baptist, so

781
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,460
we will guilt you in a way that you will not be comfortable with.

782
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,780
If you don't support us with money, then we know that you don't love us.

783
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,180
That's facts.

784
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,780
That's facts.

785
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,540
That's love in our house.

786
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,020
Ladies and gentlemen, we're passing the hat.

787
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,220
It's time for you to tithe.

788
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:01,780
If 10 percent of you just take your monthly salary, divide by 10.

789
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,060
Give us one of them.

790
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,500
Let's move on to the third stanza of our of our podcast, as long as we're keeping the

791
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,900
Baptist theme being back.

792
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,060
This is so great to get all these jokes.

793
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,020
Yeah, I have recently embarked on a year long personal crusade to shed a bunch of extra

794
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,900
LBs.

795
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,580
I've got a lot to lose, so I've broken it down into 20 pound milestones.

796
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,180
So I have goals to plan against.

797
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
And the first one is coming up soon.

798
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,500
In general, I fit the heavy set ponytail bearded nerd stereotype.

799
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,420
So recently had the idea I should probably mix it up each 20 pound milestone, cut my

800
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,300
hair, shave my beard, start dressing a little nicer.

801
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:42,820
Do you guys have any other ideas for potential me changers, health style or otherwise?

802
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,540
That's trying to rock it in Rochester.

803
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,460
First of all, good on you.

804
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,340
Yeah, good on you.

805
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,500
I love this question so much I could faint.

806
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,180
Getting it in 20 does.

807
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,980
Get that he does, you were getting it.

808
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:03,220
Here is something that I and it's an attitude thing that I actually learned from from Jesse

809
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,500
are our podcast down and have tried to sort of implement it in my day to day life.

810
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,540
And it's that when you're talking about stuff for yourself, grooming, hygiene, style, whatever,

811
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:20,500
sometimes the quickest, cheapest way, the most efficient way is not is not always the

812
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:27,460
best because you're sending a signal to yourself that you the stuff for you is is is worth

813
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,020
rushing through or is worth cheaping out on.

814
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,780
For example, example here that I'm on board with is the is the wet shave.

815
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,540
You use a brush, you do the foam, you use a safety razor.

816
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,260
It's great.

817
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,780
It's how old men did it.

818
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,980
And it's how you could do it.

819
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,140
And it and it's awesome because it takes a little longer.

820
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,540
But it's it's also it also will save me some money in the long run.

821
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,220
But it's a it's a real sort of like ritualistic way of approaching it.

822
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,580
And it's not the fastest way or the easiest way.

823
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,260
But it sends a message to yourself that, hey, I'm taking care of me.

824
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,140
I'm worth it.

825
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,980
And you're saying at every at this next upcoming 20 pound milestone, he starts he starts the

826
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,940
wet shave.

827
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,460
I say start the wet shave.

828
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,100
Do a little research that you can look at to put this on the episode that that talks

829
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,660
about I think the episode just about grooming in general.

830
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,340
But it'll tell you how to wet shave.

831
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,860
There's a lot of resources out there about it.

832
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,900
But get into it.

833
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,380
It's fun.

834
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,700
And also make sure I love the physical appearance and caring about all that.

835
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,300
Make sure that you're, you know, taking care of your mental self as well.

836
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:36,180
So maybe on the next milestone, you try something, you know, food or beverage related that you've

837
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,380
never tried before, something a little adventurous and maybe find that you have a great palette

838
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,780
for wine or you really like Italian food, you know, something new.

839
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,420
Wait, hold the fuck up, Travis.

840
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,020
What are you are you saying?

841
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:56,420
But as to reward yourself on this quest to lose weight, what you should get into is wine

842
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,700
and Italian food.

843
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,980
OK, let me strike that.

844
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,100
Oh, yeah.

845
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,060
I lost 60 pounds.

846
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,540
Time to go to the O.G. and gain it all back.

847
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,260
What about carb up and slurp down?

848
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,100
I will have all the fujul.

849
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,780
Let me see all the fujul that you got on your shelf.

850
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,860
Well, just let me introduce myself.

851
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,420
I'm fat again.

852
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,020
Then can I say art?

853
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,580
Yes, not only can you say art, you should have said art.

854
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,180
I'm going to double back and say art.

855
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,220
You can't.

856
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,860
You can't.

857
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,340
I can't.

858
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,180
You guys edit out your shit all the time.

859
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,540
He's right about that.

860
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,100
He is not wrong.

861
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:43,220
So let's say rather than food and beverage, let's say culture and maybe go to a museum

862
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:48,660
or go to see a ballet or go to see a symphony, something, you know, that maybe you're not

863
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,940
normally into and you just want to check out and see if maybe you dig it.

864
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,500
You guys are thinking so small scale.

865
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,700
I am I am amazed at you.

866
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,180
This guy is offering us a chance.

867
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:07,060
Every 20 pounds he loses, he can totally and completely reinvent his entire persona,

868
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,420
so much so that his friends won't recognize him.

869
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:16,740
Like you lose 20 pounds, cut your hair, shave your beard, wear sunglasses constantly and

870
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,940
say your name is now Roz.

871
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,980
Lose another 20 pounds.

872
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,540
Maybe you go hit the tanning bed constantly and you bleach your teeth and then you change

873
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,940
your name again to Brock or the Brock or the Mr.

874
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,340
Mr.

875
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,900
The Brock.

876
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,620
And then next time you're going to be really fit.

877
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,220
Maybe get that asshole bleach.

878
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,900
Let's see if we can't get a porn career.

879
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,020
Lose 40 pounds.

880
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,980
Bleach that asshole.

881
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,100
Regain 20.

882
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,260
Where are you at now?

883
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,540
Your friends don't know which side they're coming from.

884
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,220
Lose 40 pounds of fat.

885
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,620
Regain 20 pounds of fuck muscle.

886
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,420
Get in there.

887
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,140
What is that?

888
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,540
It's what you use to thrust.

889
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,460
It's the thrusters.

890
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,380
Yeah, it's your thrusters.

891
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,300
I just gotta get your thrusters going and your afterburners.

892
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,700
I learned these.

893
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,980
I'm going to take you to the hyper space.

894
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,020
Try a barrel roll.

895
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,660
Girl, I got bad news.

896
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,780
Our shields are failing.

897
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,820
Girl, girl.

898
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,260
Fire up the tachyon cannons.

899
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,460
Oh, man.

900
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,220
I need some more dilithium crystals, by which I mean meth.

901
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,020
Of course, in that case it would be fuck meth because it's the meth that you use for sex.

902
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,460
I learned in school that every muscle is a fuck muscle or you're just not doing it right.

903
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,420
What class was that in?

904
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,260
What school were you going to?

905
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:44,980
Health school.

906
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,500
Health school.

907
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,940
You dummy.

908
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:54,500
So, I'm excited about this man in the midst of a change.

909
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,180
If you want to, keep us updated.

910
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,260
Yeah, keep us updated.

911
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,860
Let us know what your current name is.

912
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,700
In fact, you know what?

913
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,620
I'm going to lay it out there more.

914
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,100
I'm giving this man the greatest gift, which is accountability.

915
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:16,100
If you don't send us pictures of you as you continue to lose 20 pounds and how you're reinventing.

916
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,140
Fully clothed.

917
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,420
I can't stress this enough.

918
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
Then you will have failed us.

919
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,700
We're giving you the gift of accountability.

920
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,980
We need you to get fit.

921
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,740
Roz.

922
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,180
And to bleach that asshole.

923
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,940
Don't show us that one.

924
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,500
Roz.

925
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,860
Don't show us that you can tell us about the asshole and we'll trust you.

926
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,620
Show us a receipt for the procedure.

927
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,180
Unless it depicts an asshole.

928
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,140
I don't know why it would.

929
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,540
Is this your business card?

930
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,900
That's disgusting.

931
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,820
Going over his transcript, it looks like he did just spend $80 at the asshole factory.

932
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
Which is of course where you get new assholes.

933
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,180
Fresh off the line.

934
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,300
It's actually-

935
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,780
Man, if you go to the asshole factory, you're just discounting all the mom and pop asshole stores.

936
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,060
Like, asshole in the walls.

937
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,540
But the asshole factory is really nice because you get to let the kids stuff themselves and

938
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,060
they get to pick different accessories for them and they get to name the assholes.

939
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,420
Build an asshole.

940
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,500
Build an asshole at the asshole factory.

941
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,380
That's a better approach.

942
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,700
Do you want a Yahoo?

943
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,340
Griff.

944
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,540
Yeah, I do.

945
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,860
This one was sent in by Sydney Pendle.

946
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,580
Thank you, Sydney.

947
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,060
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sleddog who asks,

948
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,260
why won't my dad let me have any Steve Urkel objects?

949
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,860
I like Steve Urkel.

950
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,940
But my dad won't let me have a shirt, a doll, anything Steve Urkel.

951
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,540
But I want Steve Urkel stuff.

952
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,300
What can I do to get Steve Urkel stuff?

953
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,460
Who the fuck calls him Steve Urkel?

954
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,340
Like, if I knew where to get Steve Urkel stuff, you know what I would have more of?

955
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,260
Steve Urkel stuff?

956
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,500
Steve Urkel stuff, yeah.

957
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,700
I would have it every day, people wouldn't know me as Justin McElroy,

958
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,020
video game writer and media gadfly.

959
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,900
They would know me as Justin McElroy,

960
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,220
the guy who wears the shirt that says, did I do that?

961
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,540
Got any cheese?

962
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,180
Yeah, these are all great Steve Urkel jokes.

963
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:19,620
I remember a kid in elementary school who 100% did have a fully rad t-shirt

964
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,340
that had a picture of Steve Urkel and just that just said, did I do that?

965
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,140
He was, of course, scooting his glasses up his nose.

966
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,780
Yeah.

967
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,660
Oh wait, I have an important question for this question asker,

968
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,580
which is beside a Steve Urkel doll and a Steve Urkel shirt,

969
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,540
what the fuck other Steve Urkel stuff is there?

970
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,900
And by the way, I just love the nomenclature Steve Urkel objects.

971
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,380
Where can I find a Steve Urkel totem?

972
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,940
This belongs in a Steve Urkel museum.

973
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:56,900
I actually, in elementary school, I had a t-shirt with Cody from Step by Step on it.

974
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,020
Didn't catch on so much.

975
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,780
Didn't get me as much critical acclaim as this Steve Urkel shirt might have.

976
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,620
It had Cody's hit catchphrase on it.

977
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,260
Which was?

978
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,540
Which was, yeah, right.

979
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,340
He said that all the time on Step by Step.

980
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,020
I did not.

981
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,980
I don't remember that.

982
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,820
I remember the episode that Steve Urkel was on.

983
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,700
Mm-hmm.

984
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,260
I'm gonna give you guys, let's say that this,

985
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,660
okay, so apparently this person's never heard of eBay.

986
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,500
I'm gonna help them out and say like, here's where you can get your Steve Urkel stuff.

987
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,540
So here are some of the items that you can no bullshit get right now.

988
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,900
You can get a 1991 Hasbro Steve Urkel 17 inch doll that talks.

989
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,700
And it does say here returns not accepted.

990
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,020
I don't want this shit back in my house ever again.

991
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,820
I'm tired of this doll trying to kill me at night.

992
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,940
This is the person who thought the Steve Urkel movement would be bigger.

993
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:57,220
And they just ordered like a wholesale on mass boxes and boxes of Steve Urkel dolls.

994
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,260
Must move.

995
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,740
Oh my God.

996
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:07,060
You can get right now a box of an unopened box of Urkel-O's the fruit,

997
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,380
the fun fruit cereal that does not contain any cheese,

998
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,340
but does contain essential vitamins and minerals.

999
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,780
And it is flavored like strawberry and banana from the fine people of Ralston.

1000
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,460
You can get that for a starting bid of 74.95.

1001
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,300
No takers at the moment.

1002
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,940
Wait, just to clarify, did you say opened or unopened?

1003
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,140
It doesn't matter, Travis.

1004
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,700
Okay.

1005
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,540
As porous as that cardboard is, you are paying $75 to get diarrhea forever.

1006
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:41,700
There is a shirt that has a picture of Steve Urkel with like that cool sort of neon scribbling

1007
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,540
that was so big in that time period that says, no sweat, my pet.

1008
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,580
Oh, Jesus.

1009
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:52,500
You can pick that up and you can also get a WWD shirt that says, what would Urkel do on it?

1010
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,220
Or, okay, this is the last one, I promise.

1011
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:02,820
You can get the Urkel board game called, Do the Urkel.

1012
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,900
Board game called Do the Urkel dance.

1013
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,460
It's just called Do the Urkel.

1014
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,900
It's a risk and roll game.

1015
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,660
Okay, this is actually the tagline.

1016
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,140
The risk and roll game that lets you be Urkel.

1017
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,700
Finally.

1018
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,500
Thank God.

1019
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,060
Finally.

1020
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,860
God, we were into that, huh?

1021
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,340
Yeah.

1022
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,180
We were deep in.

1023
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:31,140
Can you real quick just eBay search Cody from step by step?

1024
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,740
I will.

1025
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,340
I bet you can actually buy the man.

1026
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,580
Let me see what I get with no returns.

1027
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,060
No returns.

1028
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,980
No, no items.

1029
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,100
I'm so sorry.

1030
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,300
I mean, where do you think step by step went wrong?

1031
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,820
Do you think the problem is that it was Family Matters?

1032
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,500
Yes, I think-

1033
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,140
That was their first slip up is that America's heart, there's a family size hole in America's

1034
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,980
heart, which was profoundly filled by Family Matters.

1035
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,180
And then step by step came in.

1036
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,540
It's like, hey, can we just scooch?

1037
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,980
Can we, oh, nope.

1038
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,380
Oh, and then to be fair, Cody did leave about two or three seasons in and was replaced by

1039
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,260
Flash, who was on just massive amounts of speed.

1040
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,500
I think the problem was it was like the Brady Bunch, except where you wanted to have sex

1041
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,860
with too many of the girls.

1042
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,980
And it got pretty emotional.

1043
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,340
Unlike the Brady Bunch?

1044
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,140
I don't understand.

1045
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,700
Unlike the, yeah, sorry.

1046
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,220
Plus, you know what the other problem was?

1047
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,580
It was confusing to try to remember-

1048
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,780
Who was with which one?

1049
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,260
Yeah.

1050
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,540
Who was with which family?

1051
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,500
It wasn't that clear.

1052
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,460
Brady Bunch had it, right?

1053
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:35,700
After a while, they started, I guess, morph into one solid family unit, and I hated it.

1054
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,860
I wanted them to stay on separate sides and continue to dislike each other forever and

1055
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:39,940
ever.

1056
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,700
You were looking for a Game of Thrones-style family battle.

1057
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:53,540
Do you think that there's a separate side series to the Brady Bunch that features the

1058
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,900
two parents that they divorce just living cold, lonely lives where they never see their

1059
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,860
children ever?

1060
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:05,860
Here's a story about a guy named Jeff and a lady named Mary.

1061
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,420
They never mate, and then they died.

1062
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,900
So alone, they never heard from their kids again because their kids have new brothers

1063
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,460
and sisters.

1064
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,260
Their kids never mentioned them.

1065
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,660
They seem to have forgotten them or that they ever even existed at all.

1066
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:29,860
So Jeff and Mary live lives of desperation, renting movies at the red box, and that's

1067
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:37,060
the way they became depressed and forgotten, dead and forgotten.

1068
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:43,460
They are dust now, and their memories evaporated.

1069
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,860
It's like they never were born.

1070
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,860
That was dumb.

1071
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,220
That was dumb.

1072
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,020
Oh man, that's a tough life they led.

1073
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,900
We sure do have a good time here, my brother, my brother, and me.

1074
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,660
Well, let's get serious.

1075
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,740
Let's get serious.

1076
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,220
Every year-

1077
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,700
Hey guys, we've had a lot of laughs today.

1078
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,900
Every year, Jaleel White dies a little bit more.

1079
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,580
Just trying to get that comeback.

1080
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,900
We really need your money so that we can go on eBay and buy some more Stivercal stuff.

1081
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Will, other than Dancing with the Stars, which is where he is right now, right this second,

1082
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,060
will Jaleel White ever be on another hit television program?

1083
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,340
The Bachelor.

1084
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:30,420
Do you know the madness that would ensue if he were to roll up on-

1085
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:31,620
I don't-

1086
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,380
Literally anything?

1087
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,380
Like what would be the show?

1088
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,580
Where would he have to-

1089
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,500
It would have to be Big Bang Theory, right?

1090
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:38,740
No.

1091
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,220
Like he would have to roll up on Big Bang Theory as-

1092
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,260
As Stivercal.

1093
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:42,580
No, I don't want-

1094
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,580
As a professor at the-

1095
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,220
Oh my God, I would lose my mind.

1096
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,700
Not that I would see it, but I would presumably see it later on YouTube or something.

1097
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,820
I will also accept a community guest spot.

1098
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,340
I'm saying-

1099
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:03,460
I want him to explore his dramatic roots, and I want him to maybe hop on Southland as like,

1100
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,660
I'm Detective Humphries.

1101
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,740
And everybody else is like, no, you're definitely not.

1102
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,780
Guys, we've had a lot of fun.

1103
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,220
We're about to wrap up the show, but just real quick.

1104
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,140
The last few gift levels.

1105
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:21,540
If you donate $50 a month to our Max Fund Drive to help support the show and keep us afloat and grow,

1106
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,700
and $50 a month, you are a member of the Thorn Family Blondie Brigade.

1107
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,940
You will get all this stuff, the John Hodgson Friendship Emergency Kit, the water bottle,

1108
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,340
the friendship bracelet, all the Donors Only episodes.

1109
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:40,500
You will also get a batch, a homemade batch, I should say, of Jesse and Teresa Thorn's signature

1110
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,660
blondies. They will FedEx these blondies to your door.

1111
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,820
I hear they use special preservative chemicals in it to make sure the blondies don't get riddled

1112
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,780
with male worms.

1113
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,700
You are going to love eating these with your mouth.

1114
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,740
So sweet, so savory, from famous people.

1115
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,660
You are going to love them, I guarantee it.

1116
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,860
That's the $50 a month.

1117
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,260
$100 a month, you're a member of Jesse's Golden Eagles.

1118
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,940
You get an invitation to the Max Fun Dinner, which is a thing we do every June before

1119
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:14,660
Max Fun Con starts, where you get to just eat dinner with us and with John Hodgman and Jesse

1120
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,300
and Jordan.

1121
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,420
Well, we don't know who will be.

1122
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,820
We don't know.

1123
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,380
We can't promise.

1124
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,820
We can't promise who will be there, but...

1125
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:25,620
Last time, me and Griffin had dinner with John Hodgman and Chuck Bryant from Stuff You

1126
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,380
Should Know, and it was great.

1127
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,260
It was totally rad.

1128
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,860
Neil Pollock was there.

1129
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,300
It was bananas, actually.

1130
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,900
So you get that, you get the blondies, you get the friendship kit, the water bottle,

1131
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,580
the friendship bracelet, and the episodes.

1132
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:44,660
And if you really want to keep us lined with piles of sweet cocoa, you can donate $200

1133
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,060
a month and join Jordan's Platinum Angels.

1134
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:51,540
You get all this stuff, the invitation to the dinner, all that stuff, and free registration

1135
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:57,620
to next year's Max Fun Con, which is Maximum Fun's annual convention that we are going

1136
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,500
to be at this year in June.

1137
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,260
So just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash donate and just look over the levels, reach

1138
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:12,340
into your heart, grab the love that you have for us that's in there, and then pull it out

1139
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,820
and then put it on your computer screen, smear it on it.

1140
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,100
And guys, do us a favor.

1141
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,220
After you listen to this episode, go on Twitter and let us know when you donate, because we

1142
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,220
like to know that you're supporting us and make your friends feel guilty.

1143
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,940
And you can be superior over everyone else that has not donated.

1144
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,900
That's the big thing.

1145
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,500
Like, just use that Max Fun Drive hashtag and just be like, hey, listen, fools.

1146
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,780
I donate it.

1147
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,580
And then start bullying other people into it, because that's the whole point of feeling

1148
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,460
superior, I thought.

1149
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,220
Don't get on Twitter, though, and use that hashtag and talk about how we're big Corpo

1150
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,820
sellouts, because we really only do this once a year.

1151
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,620
And the return really is overwhelming.

1152
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,500
And we just we love you guys so much.

1153
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,700
Thank you, John Roger, for the long one.

1154
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,740
Let's use their song.

1155
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,740
It's Departure off the output of Dayspend.

1156
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,540
You can go grab that.

1157
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,660
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show and sending us questions and everything.

1158
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,940
We we love you very much.

1159
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,900
We appreciate all that.

1160
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,900
And if you want to send us a question, it's NBNBAM at maximumfund.org.

1161
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,340
And we will try to answer it or you can send it to Yahoo there or what have you.

1162
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:16,740
Griffin.

1163
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,620
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mark Toretsky.

1164
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,420
Thanks, Mark.

1165
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Corrin Piper Chifinch.

1166
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:29,620
Who asks, is it normal for a woman to arrive on a date dressed as a clown?

1167
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,620
I'm Justin McElroy.

1168
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1169
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1170
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,620
This is my brother.

1171
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,620
My brother may kiss your dad.

1172
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:59,380
You wear it on the lips.

1173
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,860
I listen to actually every show on Max Fund.

1174
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,180
You could say relentless positivity.

1175
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,780
That's probably a good way of putting it.

1176
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,180
They're always looking at things in the way I'd like the world to be looked at.

1177
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,140
Hi, I'm Davin.

1178
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,100
And I'm Lindsay.

1179
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,340
And we donate to maximumfund.org.

1180
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,060
Probably my brother.

1181
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,660
My brother and me was the first full episode I listened to.

1182
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:23,060
Yeah, NBNBAM was a pretty great way to start her off because those McElroys are charming.

1183
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,260
Listen to people be friends.

1184
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:25,700
Best thing.

1185
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,700
I'm super excited about throwing shade and it's so funny and it's so charming.

1186
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,380
Yeah, honestly, I feel like every year Max Fund adds new shows.

1187
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,460
And every year I step up my donation to make sure that more shows can join.

1188
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,740
Yeah, I think it's really easy to support people who make fantastic things.

1189
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:49,140
I get a ridiculous amount of entertainment from Max Fund every month and it doesn't cost me a lot.

1190
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,700
Support Maximum Fund today.

1191
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,700
Just visit maximumfund.org slash donate.

1192
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:25,460
Thank you.
