1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,320
Oh no, I'm Griffin McElroy. Travis, what's the matter, partner?

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,920
What's wrong? I didn't get the call, you know? Today, when we're recording this,

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,640
it's the first official game of the NFL 2020 season.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Oh no. Once again, I didn't make the cut.

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,840
Oh no. You've been practicing so hard.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, but I don't get to feel up the pigskin.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,360
You can't fondle the pig, and you got the tire in the backyard that you throw the football through.

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
I flip the tire, and then I throw the football through it.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,120
And then you just stomp through it. Most of your practice is tire-based.

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I remember when me and Justin and you were playing out in the field,

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,800
and you found that tire, and you picked it up, and you said, now I can play football.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,440
Well, it was a magical tire, or else what was it doing in that field? You know what I mean?

19
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,600
Like, there wasn't a car for miles.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
We were confused when you said, this tire is the key to football.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,600
But then we watched you practice with it. You worked so hard. Your body looks so crazy.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,360
And I didn't get the call. I didn't get the call.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
And so another season. And I thought this year, you know,

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,080
is like COVID-19's out there, and so maybe they'll need more people.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,960
Yeah, maybe it'll be like that situation where that one bartender from Philadelphia,

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,000
and they were like, hey, you come play for us. But nobody called me.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,320
That movie's wild. Because it's like,

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
if this fucking dude could play football, why not Travis with his magic tire?

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,400
Right. I didn't get the call. I waited. I waited by the phone.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Every day, I even drafted myself to my ding-dang fantasy football league,

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
and now I look like a total tit.

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah, you're probably not going to get many points off your own sweaty, your brow.

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
Trav, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
They won't let me write in my points.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Say like, well, today I played touch football, and I scored three touchdowns.

36
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
So that's 21 points.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
This should have been your year, though.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,680
It should have been.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,080
If not this year, you know?

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
No one's even going to be watching, you know what I mean?

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
Because like, they can't go to the stadium.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,120
No.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
Right? And so you would think that they would be like,

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
let's try some weird stuff this year.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
This would be the year for like a donkey that kicks field goals, right?

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
If they're ever going to do it.

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,720
Yeah.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
Or Tony Danza, the incredible field goal kicking garbage man.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,920
What is that?

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
I think you nailed that.

51
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,240
I think that's what you're talking about.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,600
I mean, baseball is having fun with that.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't know if you guys have been keeping track.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm not one to follow the sports news, but I did see a story today

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,720
that the Atlanta Braves won a game yesterday with a big 29 runs.

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,880
So it feels kind of like they were just like,

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,120
guys, let's just have fucking fun.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
This doesn't count.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
None of this counts.

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's just have fun with it.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Why don't you throw a few slow boys down the plate?

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,600
Let me get a few grand salamis and next game I'll let you do it

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,320
because none of this fucking counts or matters.

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,480
It has just occurred to me that there was never an equivalent

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,440
of like rookie of the year, but for like the NFL,

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,400
where it's like, hey, that nine year old threw that football pretty good.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,160
Get him in here with all these like 400 pound men.

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,440
Or I mean, in the NFL version of rookie of the year, he would be huge.

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
Like, and that would be his thing is that he would be like a linebacker

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,520
and he would be the Hulk.

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,160
He would be-

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
But he's like 10.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,320
But he's 10 years.

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,040
He's a 400 pound, 10 year old, just monster, absolute unit of a lad.

75
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,680
The garbage picking, field goal kicking, Philadelphia phenomenon

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
is the full name of the film starring Tony Danza

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
as a garbage man that is good at football.

78
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
And that's gotta have great SEO.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,280
You know what I mean?

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
So easy to remember, clear to search for.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Was the story of that movie,

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,560
can you believe this professional sanitation worker can also be an athlete?

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
They give an average guy a shot at the NFL.

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,760
Why?

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
And they make him the kick.

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,480
Well, cause he's the kicker, so who cares?

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,440
No, but I mean, even then, was it just like, hey, that guy,

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
let's see if he can do it or was there a contest?

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,600
I have like vaguest fucking fragment of a memory

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
of him kicking like water bottles really far.

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,760
And they're like, yes, this translates.

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes, you are the guy.

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Half of the players in the real life NFL

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,920
is because somebody saw them like throwing fish at the fish market

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
or like tackling a bear.

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,920
And they say, yeah, that guy's very good at tackling.

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
Scouts will sometimes just go to the tire store

98
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,080
and watch how people shelf tires and move tires around.

99
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,600
And they're like, that's football, baby.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,560
The end of that film,

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
I pulled up the Wikipedia page to get the right name.

102
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
At the end of that film,

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,920
the holder of the football fumbles the snap

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,640
and Tony Danza grabs it and scores the game winning touchdown.

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,680
So even the creators of the garbage picking field goal kicking

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,880
Philadelphia phenomena agree that a kick is too boring of a way to end.

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
It's just not interesting enough.

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
It has to be a touchdown.

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
You can't just make it a good kick.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,640
That's nothing.

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
I mean, I would, I disagree

112
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,280
because I would watch a game that's just kicks.

113
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,040
That's just kicking back and just field goal after just a shootout.

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,320
Soccer.

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh, fuck.

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Wait, what now?

117
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
But the ball would be super silly.

118
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Like they wouldn't, that's what I love about the American.

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
Put a little water in it.

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,480
The European football is like spherical

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,000
in a way that is sort of like geometrically pleasing to some.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
But I love the way that when American football hit the ground,

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
it's like, good luck fuckers.

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
I want more weird balls in sport and by which I'm,

125
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
but when I say that, I don't really want it that bad.

126
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,800
I really feel like in order for sport to move me these days,

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
you need to score 29 big, big runs in a single game.

128
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Cause that, fuck yeah.

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Now we're playing some like broken, you know, MLB 2K on the dreamcast.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
It's transformed into Blaseball.

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
If I may, here's what I think would really,

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,320
if I might fix football in 2020 to get more people watching.

133
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
Cosmic football.

134
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
A lot more like, you know, after hours bowling alley

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
where everything's like, you know, black light and like neon.

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
And like, maybe you play some like, especially funky music,

137
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
PG-13 music, if you will, Cupid Shuffle,

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,320
where you're not sure where the sexual part is,

139
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
but it sounds pretty good.

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,160
It sounds good.

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
And that's great, Trav.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Say, is part of your plan also maybe make the field a little bit shorter?

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
Maybe get rid of some of the penalties

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,320
and then maybe have a sort of strict opinion

145
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,720
about political demonstrations on the field there, Vince McMahon, or?

146
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,640
Wait, in XFL, is there like the ball is black light?

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah, yeah, it is.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
Aw, no.

149
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
Well, it's so you can make sure everybody did wash their hands.

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,440
For safety.

151
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
It's for safety.

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
Oh, but you like, all the uniforms are black, right?

153
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,920
But, but you put some like neon reflective tape on

154
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
to make them look like stick men running around?

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
Oh, or skeletons.

156
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, shit.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Oh, yeah, for the Halloween season.

158
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
You can dress up.

159
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
You can do your own costume.

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
That's cool.

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,200
That would be like when we played mascot football.

162
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,240
When I was, I played mascot football

163
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
at a River City Locomotives indoor arena football game,

164
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
and I was cowabunga, the cow for WTCR,

165
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
and I went out there on that beautiful field,

166
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,920
and it was my crowning achievement

167
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,480
because I did run in a beautiful touchdown,

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,680
but I only accomplished it

169
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,200
because Louie the lightning bug

170
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
sacked the fucking shit out of Shoney Bear

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,520
and sent her forehead flying 10 yards down the field.

172
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,000
It was-

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
I've been in that cow costume.

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
Visibility is low.

175
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,840
It is limited.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
It was an incredible catch.

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
It was, it'll be the end of my movie.

178
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
Nothing I've done after that is gonna be better,

179
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
but it's also going to be the start

180
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,040
of Louie the lightning bug's movie

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,480
because he really made Shoney Bear eat fucking mud.

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
There's a scout who's like,

183
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
give me that lightning bug.

184
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
He tackles good,

185
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
but then he can only tackle in the lightning bug costume.

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
You gotta play it safe around me.

187
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Is Louie the lightning bug a universal reference

188
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,520
or a local reference?

189
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,480
We'll find out, won't we?

190
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Should we do a question?

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
I'd love that.

192
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
Thank you so much.

193
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
Thank you so much.

194
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Sorry, I'm really excited about all the good Munch Squad

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
I have this episode.

196
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I feel like I've been seeing a lot of Munch Squad

197
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,760
in the ether.

198
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
I feel like people are getting-

199
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,560
They've all just been saved up in the pipe.

200
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
There's been a big clog.

201
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
It's so, I almost don't wanna,

202
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
oh wait, oh wait.

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
No, no, you can't do that.

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Yeah, you can't Munch Squad for some reason.

205
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
Just rip it, baby.

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
Give me question number two.

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
I'll do a couple throughout the show.

208
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Can we do that?

209
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,400
Can we just do a couple throughout the show?

210
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

211
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,580
Munch.

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,320
Okay, Munch Squad.

213
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
It's podcast within podcast.

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,960
Profiling the latest and greatest of brand eating.

215
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,480
There's just so much going on that I need to talk about.

216
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
You guys hear about the Candyman?

217
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,660
What?

218
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,760
Don't say it again.

219
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,880
Candyman is David Klein.

220
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,280
He is the creator of the Jelly Belly.

221
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,600
Okay.

222
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Oh, I heard about this.

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,400
So he, not Jelly Belly's themselves,

224
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
but the creator of the Jelly Belly

225
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,360
who kind of struck out on his own

226
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
after I assume selling the brand

227
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,840
for a lot of money.

228
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
The Candyman is doing-

229
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Ah, you said it three times.

230
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
Okay, I knew you were just,

231
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
I wanted to get it out of the way.

232
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
So I beat you to it.

233
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
So he is doing a Willy Wonka style

234
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Jelly Belly, a Willy Wonka style treasure hunt

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,840
where he is going to give away a candy factory

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,160
if you find the golden tickets that he has hidden around.

237
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,480
Okay.

238
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,400
He couldn't even like take it and turn it and twist it.

239
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,440
He just said like,

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
like he watches like Willy Wonka with his kids

241
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
and said, ah, fuck it.

242
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
And he's just gonna like copy and paste

243
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
Willy Wonka's whole deal?

244
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
No, no, Travis, he's not.

245
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
He's gonna mix it up quite a bit.

246
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,800
There is a gold ticket hidden in one in each state

247
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080
as I understand it.

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah.

249
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,520
I will now tell you the particulars of this contest.

250
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
And this is, I'm reading directly from thegoldticket.com.

251
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,200
How to play.

252
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,080
Each treasure hunt game will have a game location

253
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,440
and a start date and cost $49.98 to play.

254
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
And then it says, this is the cost for the riddle.

255
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,840
This is the cost for the riddle?

256
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,600
This is the, it says in parentheticals,

257
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
this is the cost for the riddle.

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
The registered person who purchased the game

259
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
will be signed up in a private forum.

260
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
You must have a Facebook account.

261
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,160
The day and time your treasure hunt starts,

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,080
you will receive the riddle in your group.

263
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
You will be looking for a gold ticket

264
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,400
in the form of a necklace with a tag

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,360
that includes a code you need to verify your find.

266
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
Winners will receive $5,000.

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Gold ticket codes must be submitted to,

268
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
this is the email address.

269
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
All treasure hunt players will be eligible

270
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,880
to join in on the ultimate treasure hunt

271
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,520
where I give away one of my candy factories.

272
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Okay, but, okay, in real life though,

273
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
getting that candy factory means

274
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
now you have employees to worry about

275
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
and like payroll taxes and like fucking workman's comp

276
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
and OSHA and shit.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,280
It's not like, yes, let's fold this river of chocolates.

278
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, yes, I have that, everything's eatable.

279
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,600
I think OSHA gives a little bit of just a,

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
it gives a bit of clearance to candy factories.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
If Willy Wonka's film is to be believed.

282
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
I think OSHA is like,

283
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,320
they're doing something wonderful and whimsical over there.

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Let's just let them do what they need to do

285
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
to make these jelly beans.

286
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,360
Yeah, I mean, assuming, sorry,

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,400
I got a little bit distracted

288
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,040
because I was absolutely paying the $50

289
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
I need to get in on this incredible treasure hunt.

290
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
West Virginia, you could-

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,880
Guys, don't get it twisted.

292
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
$50 is the cost for the riddle, okay?

293
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
So I'm pretty excited.

294
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
You could take this for West Virginia.

295
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,960
That's what I feel like.

296
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,200
I feel like I've got a pretty good shot here.

297
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
What's stopping you from paying the $50,

298
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
getting the riddle,

299
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,920
and then just blasting that out

300
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,400
to our millions and millions and millions of listeners?

301
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh, that's a good idea.

302
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,520
Cause I paid the cost for the riddle.

303
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,600
Right, that's not the, no prize to enter

304
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
or like, you know what I mean?

305
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
Like anyone can enter,

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,240
but if you want the riddle, you pay $49.

307
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm assuming that you have to pay the $49.98

308
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
to get the riddle,

309
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
but I'm not going to give the riddle away for free.

310
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
I wouldn't do the Candyman like that.

311
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
He and I are going to be working in very close concert

312
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,680
when I start doing the candy factory

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
the way I want to do it.

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,560
If you know what I mean?

315
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
What kind of big changes do you got planned, Justin,

316
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,280
for the Jelly Belly brand?

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,640
It's okay.

318
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,080
I can't stress this enough.

319
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,040
This is in no way connected to the Jelly Belly brand.

320
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
Candyman is a different guy.

321
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
He sold Jelly Belly.

322
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
He sold Jelly Belly.

323
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,920
Jelly Belly has no, there's going to be people

324
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
walking up to a factory like,

325
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
I'll take this one.

326
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
No, we're not doing, that's not the thing.

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,800
So what does he produce in his mini factories?

328
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Do you want me to list the products of CandymanKitchens.com?

329
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,600
There's crime scene candy and blood and cloth.

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Ew, God.

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
That's one, that's one that you can get.

332
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,400
You know what, just leave it there, J-Man,

333
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,440
because now I want to win so I can shut it down.

334
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Shut it all down.

335
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
Make this stuff ethically, do it different.

336
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,840
I believe in farm to table blood clot candy.

337
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,400
Here's a quote.

338
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
The world needs this right now.

339
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
We have received thousands of comments from people who say

340
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
this has come at such a perfect time.

341
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
We've received thousands of comments of like,

342
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,640
please give me candy factory, I need this.

343
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,600
I was just thinking about how if somebody did a Willy Wonka,

344
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
it would really start fixing shit.

345
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,520
Yeah, that would fix it all.

346
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
So I'm so excited about that.

347
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
I will keep you guys abreast of my progress.

348
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,120
Okay.

349
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
This will be the greatest Riddle Me Piss of our generation.

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
And maybe the last one so that the stakes are very high.

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Yeah.

352
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
If I win, you can't do Riddle Me Piss anymore.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,400
And if you win, I assume you're retiring

354
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,520
from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

355
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,560
Oh, the show's done.

356
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
The show's done.

357
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, the show's over, yeah.

358
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
I have a candy factory.

359
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
It'll be Justin's candy factory,

360
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,280
but I'm assuming you will let us sort of,

361
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760
you know, join the board at least and we can sort of-

362
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,080
Oh yeah, yeah, you'll be on the board for sure.

363
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,000
I need to get my wisdom teeth out soon

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
and I'm looking to sell them to an artist.

365
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
I'm really tight on money right now.

366
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,480
And as an artist, I love supporting other artists.

367
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,400
The issue is I don't know how to find

368
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,080
any artists looking for teeth.

369
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,160
I looked everywhere and no one is buying.

370
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
How much should I sell them for?

371
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,240
How can I sell my teeth so I can eat

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
through a straw for a while?

373
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,360
That's from Strap for Cash in St. Paul, Minnesota.

374
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,400
Or Minneapolis, Minnesota.

375
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Minneapolis is a city in the-

376
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,760
There's so much going on in this question.

377
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't get out of the house anymore.

378
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,920
I've been to this place and it's but a faint memory.

379
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
There's so much going on.

380
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,280
My favorite thing about this question,

381
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,720
what makes me love this question

382
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,960
is that you question asker were like,

383
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
and so I'm gonna sell them to an artist.

384
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
Don't get it twisted.

385
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,840
No artists are buying them.

386
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,880
So this is a wholly created scenario.

387
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm gonna search Craigslist for teeth.

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay.

389
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,440
There's 287 results for teeth.

390
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm gonna check eBay for human teeth.

391
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Yeah, I should have-

392
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800
I don't wanna just make something up.

393
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
I should have been more specific.

394
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,800
Well, here's-

395
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,480
I got a lot of-

396
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
Okay, okay.

397
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,760
All right.

398
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,160
Let's all explain sort of what we found.

399
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
Okay, have you found prices?

400
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
Travis, you're not looking at prices, right?

401
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,520
No, I'm not.

402
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Okay, let's say 20 teeth.

403
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,760
Okay.

404
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,520
What would you-

405
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,440
What do you think the going set is on that?

406
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,160
20 teeth?

407
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,200
Are these adult teeth or baby teeth?

408
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
These are a lot.

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm looking at the very first result.

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,280
How many-

411
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,320
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

412
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,320
It does specify pre-owned.

413
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,320
Oh, okay.

414
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,760
Good.

415
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,800
Okay, okay.

416
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Glad that mystery's cleared up.

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Okay, okay.

418
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
Lot of human teeth.

419
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,720
The very first result.

420
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
Lot of human teeth.

421
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,040
This is the new Haunted Town Watch.

422
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm just gonna talk about-

423
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay, lot of human teeth, 20 teeth.

424
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
What are you gonna pay for these teeth?

425
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,160
What do you think the-

426
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm gonna say 200.

427
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
200 for the lot.

428
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
Current bid is $50.

429
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,740
Okay.

430
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Now, that's not a buy it now.

431
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
There is a buy it now.

432
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,520
I have eight fucking grotesque teeth that I'm looking at

433
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
that you could buy for 35 bucks.

434
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
They are vulgar and they make me want to throw up.

435
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,400
Now, there's a really-

436
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,520
This says nice set of human teeth for crafts.

437
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
Hand selected 27 count.

438
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
Intact crowns with some signs of minor decay

439
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
and incomplete root formation to perfect.

440
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,800
Perfect teeth.

441
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,120
And now this is 27 perfect teeth.

442
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,840
What are you gonna give me?

443
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
For 27 perfect?

444
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,160
Perfect teeth.

445
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,040
There's a buy it now.

446
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,840
Uh, I'm gonna say, okay, I was way off last time.

447
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm gonna say $100.

448
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
Wow, $125.

449
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,640
So that's where we're at price-wise.

450
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
So let me just run the-

451
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
Also, backdoor, welcome to my new pitch for a spinoff

452
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,920
of Antiques Roadshow.

453
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
I brought in my teeth.

454
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
Oh, these are excellent.

455
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
These are, this is colonial style.

456
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,720
I love this.

457
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
If we're doing four wisdom teeth,

458
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,920
then at most, if we're using this,

459
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,160
you're gonna be able to sell them for 18 and a half bucks,

460
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,680
which ain't nothing, but it's also, I don't know,

461
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
not a lot to pay rent or whatever.

462
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
You gotta look at the market, right?

463
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
Cause you gotta think,

464
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,520
baby teeth are probably way down there, right?

465
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440
A lot of baby teeth floating around.

466
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,320
Everybody's got them.

467
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
You know, like you had them at some point,

468
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
you lost them at some point.

469
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
It is guaranteed that there will always be

470
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
more and more baby teeth on the market.

471
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,680
Then right after that has to be wisdom teeth, right?

472
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,000
Like wisdom teeth is a thing that comes in

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
and almost everybody gets their removed.

474
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,280
You gotta think, top dollar is going for front adult teeth.

475
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
Grown folks teeth, yeah.

476
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
Yeah, like those front four.

477
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
This reframes the popular holiday song,

478
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
All I Want for Christmas is my two front teeth.

479
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
And it's like, don't be so fucking,

480
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
like I want a Nintendo 64 for Christmas.

481
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
Like we don't always get the things that we want.

482
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
That would be like $500 for two front,

483
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
the best teeth are your two front teeth.

484
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
Maybe incisors, I might give you incisors

485
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,680
because incisors, you only got four of them.

486
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
And they do a lot of the ripping and tearing work, right?

487
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Molars, that's all grinding, right?

488
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
A lot of those that are in the back,

489
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,320
you don't even see them as much.

490
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,080
Incisors though, I feel like maybe those are the money teeth.

491
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,400
It's hard to say.

492
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,880
I've decided, I've just made a decision.

493
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm gonna set up, okay, yes, this will be good.

494
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,320
I'm gonna set up a program.

495
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,720
Oh boy.

496
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,880
I, Justin McElroy, will buy the teeth for $100.

497
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
Question asker, please give me your Venmo information.

498
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,680
I will Venmo you the teeth for $100.

499
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,000
This is an enormous breach of-

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,720
$100.

501
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,600
Power dynamics.

502
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,000
I feel like-

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,560
No, listen.

504
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Yeah, there's a condition coming, hold on.

505
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,960
There's a part two, okay?

506
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,920
If you are an artist, please email us

507
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,400
with the subject line, I will use the teeth,

508
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
and then tell us in as much detail as possible

509
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
your plans for the teeth.

510
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh boy.

511
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
We will then read some of these on the program

512
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,160
and choose the best use of the teeth

513
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,600
that we will then legally own and arrange shipping

514
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
from the tooth holder to the artist.

515
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,800
Now, I want to stress something.

516
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,880
Me and Travis have nothing to do with this.

517
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,680
Yes, one, legally Griffin and I are not a part of this.

518
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,440
Two, anyone listening to this who's like,

519
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
I'd sell my teeth, this is a one-time thing.

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
It's a one-time deal.

521
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,240
We're not going to set this show up

522
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,560
as a black market tooth exchange.

523
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,240
Just this one time, and if, listen,

524
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,760
if you are not A, a legitimate artist,

525
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,040
who B, does not have a legitimate use for these,

526
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
because you know we're going to fight,

527
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,680
we'll be all over you for pictures,

528
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,960
descriptions by the moment, use of the teeth.

529
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm going to need all the details,

530
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,760
so do not try to wade into this

531
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,480
like you're just going to pick up teeth craft.

532
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,120
I need a real artist who has a real great idea.

533
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,160
Hey, are we sure that this is entirely legal?

534
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,840
It doesn't feel so much legal to me.

535
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,040
Because we're paying a human being for part of their body

536
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,760
and then we're giving, yeah, no, correct.

537
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm sending $100 to a friend

538
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,320
who will then be so inspired by my generosity

539
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
that they're going to mail their teeth to a stranger.

540
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,680
That's all that's happening here.

541
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,200
Okay, so at no point are you going to touch these teeth?

542
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
I can't stress this enough.

543
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,800
I at no point want to see or possess these teeth.

544
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Until they are art.

545
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,320
The deal is off.

546
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,200
Until they're art.

547
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,760
Until they're art.

548
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,160
And then I double don't want them.

549
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,040
Yeah, then you need to donate that shit to a museum.

550
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,720
Then it belongs to a museum.

551
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
So I don't want the teeth.

552
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
I don't want to see the teeth until the art is.

553
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
And then I still don't want them.

554
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Not in person, for sure.

555
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,280
No, but this is a tooth patronage.

556
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,720
Please follow up.

557
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Just reply to your first email with your payment information.

558
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,880
I will buy the teeth on consignment.

559
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,360
No, you will send them a gift of $100.

560
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,200
I will send them a gift with the understanding

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,600
that you will then send the teeth to a deserving artist

562
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,280
who would just love those chompy little crows.

563
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
And I swear to God, if somebody's like,

564
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
I'm going to glue them to Mona Lisa.

565
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,160
That's fucking funny.

566
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
That would look funny.

567
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
Stop it.

568
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,760
Don't waste our time.

569
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
You're keeping real artists who really need real teeth,

570
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,000
real bad, from our awareness.

571
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
So please don't do that.

572
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,800
Here's, can I?

573
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,440
Get that email address, by the way, it's mbnbam.maximumfun.org.

574
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,680
And just make sure the subject line is,

575
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,360
I will use the teeth in all casts.

576
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,040
And hey, let's not make it weird, okay, everybody?

577
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,880
Let's keep it pretty chill.

578
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
Let's keep it cool and nice.

579
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
Nothing weird with these teeth.

580
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,040
What if it turns out there's a huge tooth demand, though?

581
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,200
Oh, I thought you were going to say a huge tooth.

582
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
You get the teeth in and it's like,

583
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
whoa, what the fuck?

584
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
This was a deep root.

585
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,880
Can I do a Yahoo that was sent in by Yohannes?

586
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,240
Yes.

587
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
Okay, thank you, Yohannes.

588
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
It's from an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

589
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
I'm going to call Dr. Teeth, who asks,

590
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
this question's so powerful.

591
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,720
Which actors would have played Frasier

592
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,320
if Frasier could regenerate like the Doctor on Doctor Who?

593
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
Yes, yes.

594
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,840
Yes, yes. Dr. Frasier is at an opera,

595
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,920
chandelier, snap, falls from the ceiling, smashes him.

596
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,600
Smashes him dead.

597
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
The only way to kill Frasier.

598
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,600
The only way that Frasier can be killed.

599
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,000
And then everybody's like, oh no, Frasier, he's dead.

600
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
But then he starts to glow.

601
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,040
Kelsey Grammer turns into-

602
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
John Lithgow.

603
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
I was also thinking John Lithgow!

604
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:55,920
Boom!

605
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,520
Amazing, amazing.

606
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,600
John Lithgow, a second chandelier, whoop, snap, right on Johnny boy.

607
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,920
He starts to fucking glow again.

608
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
This time he turns into Justin.

609
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,120
He turns into Justin.

610
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
No, it doesn't turn.

611
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,040
I have to name an actor now.

612
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah, you weren't already thinking of one?

613
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
Come on, play the fucking game.

614
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,600
Get your head in the game, boy.

615
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
This is a game, boy.

616
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
Daniel Radcliffe?

617
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,240
No.

618
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
No, Travis, you can't.

619
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
No, we only yes on this show.

620
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Okay, I missed the question.

621
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,280
I mean, you guys sound insane to me right now.

622
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
Wait, you missed the question?

623
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
You guys sound so wild.

624
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,360
I just missed the question.

625
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
Okay, Travis, don't tell him the question.

626
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,800
Justin, I want more answers to the question.

627
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,680
Okay.

628
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,520
Daniel Radcliffe is crushed by-

629
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
What have you heard so far, Justin?

630
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
I heard John Lithgow and something about a chandelier.

631
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
Okay, perfect.

632
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,560
Do you know everything you need to know?

633
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,320
Daniel Radcliffe is tragically smushed

634
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,200
by a third, even bigger chandelier.

635
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
His body starts to glow and he transforms into-

636
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,160
Larry Bird?

637
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh.

638
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,080
An interesting choice that I don't hate.

639
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,760
Now that might seem like a stunt choice.

640
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
But Larry Bird, I will say this,

641
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
probably knows a lot about wine.

642
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
I don't hate it, Juice.

643
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
Wait, how does wine figure in-

644
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,400
I don't hate it, Juice.

645
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,240
How does wine figure in-

646
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
You're never gonna believe this.

647
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,080
Now, who would you-

648
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,880
The first chandelier-

649
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,360
Who would you partner with Larry Bird?

650
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
No, because there's not two doctors on Doctor Who.

651
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,320
No, but the doctor gets new companions.

652
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,680
Okay, wait, so there's Doctor Who,

653
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,120
there's wine is involved, okay.

654
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
Okay, the first chandelier-

655
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,160
Doctor Who gets new companions, though.

656
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
That's true.

657
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
The first chandelier-

658
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,760
It's gotta be Jordan, by the way.

659
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,640
I'd love to see the two of you.

660
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
Oh, I could hang with that.

661
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,680
The first chandelier zips back up to the ceiling

662
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,840
and then falls on Larry Bird, tragically killing him,

663
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,960
but his body starts to glow

664
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
and then he transforms into Who next, Justin?

665
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
Well, can I give you another point of data, Justin?

666
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,360
What I was gonna say,

667
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,240
maybe see if this will-

668
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,920
Give me a hint, yeah.

669
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,880
Richard Dreyfuss was what I was gonna say next.

670
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,000
Richard Dreyfuss is a very,

671
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
I will say this, Travis, a very dry choice.

672
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,360
And I'm gonna squish him basically immediately.

673
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,160
Okay, that's fair.

674
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
Richard Dreyfuss transforms into Who next, Justin?

675
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,160
In this classic role that is not Doctor Who.

676
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,000
Aaliyah Shawkat.

677
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,800
Huh.

678
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Holy shit.

679
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
I'd watch the fuck out of that.

680
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
Yeah, I mean, I've watched the fuck out of that.

681
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,320
Would, okay, let me see if I can phrase this

682
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,160
in a question that won't give it entirely away,

683
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,360
is that would there be any dramatic changes

684
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,000
to the personality of this classic character

685
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
as played by Aaliyah Shawkat?

686
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
Or are we just going straight down the middle?

687
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,680
Shorter?

688
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

689
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,280
Urbane, probably more urbane.

690
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,560
More urbane.

691
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,360
Not possible.

692
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,560
Okay, erudite?

693
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,760
More erudite.

694
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
More erudite.

695
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Holy shit.

696
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,960
Wow, fucking-

697
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
Wait, let me make sure that word means-

698
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,760
It's gonna be off the charts.

699
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
Oh man, I was trying to Google the definition for erudite

700
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,000
and I Google the definition for erudite,

701
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,600
which is so embarrassing on like three different levels

702
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,680
at the same time.

703
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Erudite.

704
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,440
So, I mean, Justin, I'm gonna go ahead and tell you,

705
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
we are talking about Frasier,

706
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
and I think Aaliyah Shawkat as Frasier

707
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,160
is one of the boldest sort of choices you've-

708
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,360
Frasier!

709
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
I put it right up there with Larry Bird though,

710
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,480
who I think right there, Larry Bird was announced

711
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,040
and I think a big part of the audience was like,

712
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,800
no thank you, stunt casting.

713
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,440
But it wasn't stunt casting, he auditioned.

714
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
He said, don't give it to me just on my name,

715
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
give it to me based on merit.

716
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,800
He auditioned, nailed it.

717
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,320
Even Kelsey Grammer was like,

718
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,360
that's more, he's more Frasier than-

719
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
He's Frasiest.

720
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,480
And so they gave it to Larry Bird

721
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
and Larry Bird did great.

722
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
He ran for nine seasons.

723
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,040
I think that most television sitcom producers are cowards.

724
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,520
Yeah.

725
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,960
Because, let me hit you with this.

726
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Season three finale of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,

727
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,560
they fucking, Aunt Viv is like walking down the stairs

728
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,920
and then like trips and goes over and falls horribly

729
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,760
and is just dunsies.

730
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,040
And Fresh Prince is like, oh no!

731
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
But then she transforms into a different actress

732
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,560
and that's the way that they fucking write that out.

733
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,520
That's how they write that off.

734
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,480
You don't just do a switch, fucking Two and a Half Men.

735
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,840
Well, I guess they did do a sort of in-fiction thing

736
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
for Two and a Half Men, but-

737
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
But not to say he didn't just regenerate

738
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
into a different character.

739
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,520
That's fair.

740
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
Because here's the thing, Doctor Who,

741
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,680
that was bullshit they made up to recast the part, right?

742
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Yeah.

743
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,440
It's not like, well, it's just true about Time Lords.

744
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
No, they fucking made that up.

745
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,400
Anyone could make that up.

746
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
Anyone can do it.

747
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
You guys wanna hear the fucking best,

748
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,680
I actually have the best casting for Frasier and Nott.

749
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay.

750
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,240
Okay.

751
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,440
This is what would happen if it was getting rebooted today.

752
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm gonna get Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons

753
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,360
as Frasier and Nott.

754
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,920
I love it.

755
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,680
They're back.

756
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
They're back together again.

757
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
Okay.

758
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,680
The Big Bangs are banging once more.

759
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,880
And get Kaylee for Daphne.

760
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,440
Now, Justin, it just kind of feels like what you're doing

761
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
is you're both rebooting Frasier,

762
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
but also Big Bang Theory.

763
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,280
This is sort of your back door.

764
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,640
Mayim Bialik is Ross.

765
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,760
Mayim Bialik is Ross.

766
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,160
Easy.

767
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,360
Okay, you're just kind of slamming Big Bang Theory

768
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,080
and Frasier together and seeing what noise it makes.

769
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm just hearing the wet slap of Frasier and Big Bang Theory

770
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
just kind of running into each other in your large head.

771
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,520
Who plays Martin, Justin?

772
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
Wil Wheaton.

773
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,520
Okay.

774
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,280
And who plays the dog?

775
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,320
John Ross Bowie.

776
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,280
John Ross Bowie is back with Christine.

777
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,680
Christine Baranski was on Big Bang Theory.

778
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,080
Okay.

779
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,720
Perfect.

780
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,120
You guys know a lot about this.

781
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I think she was probably also on Frasier.

782
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,680
You guys know a lot about Big Bang Theory.

783
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,440
Thank you, girl.

784
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Yeah, you know, you hope somebody's gonna notice.

785
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,480
Let's take a quick break.

786
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Oh, wait, hold on, Justin.

787
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,760
Parsons, Galecki.

788
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,040
Which one's which?

789
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
Which one's Frasier?

790
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
Which one's Niles?

791
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
True West.

792
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,760
True West, baby.

793
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
It's True Westing it.

794
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,120
True Westing it, baby.

795
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Every episode's a True West.

796
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,720
And so they swap episode to episode,

797
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
not halfway through each episode?

798
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,840
Interesting.

799
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,480
No, every commercial break, that's the best option.

800
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
There's very distinct glasses.

801
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
That's great.

802
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Maybe they have hats that they always wear.

803
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,960
Let's take a quick break

804
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
and then we'll be right back with more great content.

805
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,560
Holy shit.

806
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,060
Smooth.

807
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
Do you guys remember when Kelsey Grammer fell off that stage?

808
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Oh, yeah, baby.

809
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,640
I think about it every day.

810
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,680
Every single day.

811
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,440
Hey, Griffin.

812
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah.

813
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,680
Bring me some food.

814
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,760
Nope, you're too far away from me.

815
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
No, I'll tell you what food I want.

816
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,480
Okay.

817
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
And I'll give you money for it.

818
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Right.

819
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,320
But you have to bring it to me.

820
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
No, you're several thousand miles away.

821
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,360
That sucks.

822
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,320
What am I supposed to do?

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Starve.

824
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,000
Damn it.

825
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,520
Or use DoorDash.

826
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,160
You can do DoorDash.

827
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,800
Oh.

828
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,280
Yeah, that's the other option.

829
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
What is this DoorDash you mentioned?

830
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh, it's the app that brings food

831
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,120
that you're craving right now to your door.

832
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
It's weird that you're asking me all this

833
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
because it is in the copy points.

834
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,720
And so I think like if this is a-

835
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,240
Oh, wait, you're reading from something?

836
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,800
If this is like a need that you need filled,

837
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,080
there's literal text information in front of you.

838
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,200
It's really easy to use it.

839
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,480
You just open the DoorDash app

840
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,440
and you choose what you want to eat

841
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
and then your food will be left safely outside your door

842
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
with the new contactless delivery drop-off setting.

843
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
And then they have all your favorite local restaurants

844
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
that are open for delivery.

845
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,560
And you just pick them-

846
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,800
I haven't gotten any new food into my house

847
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,480
since March of 2020.

848
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
Oh, no, that's not good.

849
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,360
Well, you should be getting more food,

850
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
but also DoorDash is a really great way to do it.

851
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
And right now our listeners can get $5 off

852
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
their first order of $15 or more

853
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
and zero delivery fees for their first month

854
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,600
when you download the DoorDash app

855
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,960
and enter the code BROTHER.

856
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,480
That's $5 off your first order

857
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,840
and zero delivery fees for a month

858
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,120
when you download the DoorDash app

859
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
in the app store and enter code BROTHER.

860
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't forget one last time,

861
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,520
that's BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

862
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,320
Hey Justin.

863
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
What's up?

864
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,760
I want you to make me a website.

865
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
I don't know how to make a website.

866
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
Well, I'll tell you how to make it.

867
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,440
And then if anything breaks on it,

868
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,680
you'll be there to help me fix it 24-7.

869
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
How's that sound?

870
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
That's a huge amount of pressure, Travis.

871
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
I don't think I can.

872
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,760
Well, I need you to use some beautiful templates

873
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,600
and I need help showcasing my work

874
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,760
and selling products and services of all kinds.

875
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,480
And I assume you offer analytics

876
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,080
that help me grow in real time?

877
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,880
I can barely do the website.

878
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,720
What fucking good are you then?

879
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm just gonna use Squarespace.

880
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
You can get, hey,

881
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,840
you can both get out of here.

882
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,680
From now on, I got two brothers, DoorDash and Squarespace.

883
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,600
That's it.

884
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,760
Those are the only brothers I answer to

885
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,080
and I look forward to spending Christmas with them.

886
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,720
Wow, this is so combative.

887
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Hey Squarespace, I love you.

888
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,160
We're blood now.

00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,840
Thank you for helping me promote my physical online business.

890

and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

894
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,840
You've always been there for me

895
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
unlike my two lazy brothers

896
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,840
who will neither bring me food nor build me a website.

897
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,040

898
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,720

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
It says that.

905
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,240
It says only us, no one else or else we'll know

906
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,440
and it's over.

907
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,640
It says turn over all your physical belongings

908
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,600
to Squarespace.

909
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,760
We're all the family you'll ever need.

910
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,000
Wild that it says that.

911
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,720
It does.

912
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
I don't think that's good.

913
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,520
I mean, listen, from my experience so far,

914
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,880
it's all the family I need.

915
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,380
Okay.

916
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Hi, my name is Graham Clark

917
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,720
and I'm one half of the podcast stop podcasting yourself,

918
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,440
a show that we've recorded for many, many years.

919
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,480
And at the moment, instead of being in person,

920
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,080
we're recording remotely and you wouldn't even notice.

921
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,440
You don't even notice the lag.

922
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
That's right, Graham.

923
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,240
And the great thing about this, go ahead.

924
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,760
No, you go ahead.

925
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,800
Okay.

926
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,600
Okay, go ahead.

927
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,040
And you can listen to us every week on MaximumFun.org.

928
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
Or wherever you get your podcasts.

929
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Your podcasts.

930
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,360
Can I do another Yahoo that was sent in by a lot of people?

931
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,360
Give me that big, dirty, stinky Yahoo.

932
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,160
Jesus.

933
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,680
This one was sent in by several people.

934
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,840
Like I said, it's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

935
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
who I'm going to call Tammy.

936
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,880
Tammy asks, is it impolite not to open the window

937
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,080
when a crow who used to be my friend knocks on it?

938
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
Wait, I used to be friends with a crow in my street.

939
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
He comes to my window for snacks

940
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,600
and has sometimes brought me cool rocks.

941
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,800
But last week he saw me walk my dog and hacked at him.

942
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,160
My dog was so scared.

943
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,120
I'm extremely mad at the crow now and can't even look at him.

944
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,640
He doesn't get snacks anymore.

945
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
But now he started to knock on my window.

946
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,440
I feel so impolite not opening, but I am still angry.

947
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,600
Should I maybe wait until he is sorry

948
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,960
or apologizes in some way?

949
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,080
Well, neither of those are going to happen.

950
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,880
Yeah, I will tell you, Griffin, for a second there,

951
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,440
I thought what the question asker meant was,

952
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
this is my friend.

953
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,240
He died and is now a crow.

954
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,040
Oh, interesting.

955
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,640
Yeah, and he keeps knocking on my window.

956
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Let me tell you this, Tammy.

957
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,040
Your mistake here was you forgot that at the end of the day,

958
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,200
no matter how many shiny stones or snacks

959
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,840
you exchange with this crow, it's still a crow.

960
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,000
And crows is going to hack at dogs, right?

961
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,360
This is kind of like the frog and the scorpion

962
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,400
where the scorpion's like, hey, give me a ride.

963
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,040
And the frog's like, no way, dude, you're a scorpion.

964
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,000
And he's like, nah, it's cool.

965
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,360
If I kill you, I'll die too.

966
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
And then he does kill him and he dies too.

967
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,600
And he's like, you forgot I was a scorpion.

968
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,160
Wow.

969
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,640
Except this is like the Tammy and the crow

970
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,280
where Tammy was like, hey, be my buddy.

971
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,040
And the crow's like, you absolutely got it.

972
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,800
Also, I'm going to peck your fingers.

973
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
And you're like, oh, a crow?

974
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,520
It's like, yeah, I'm a fucking crow, dude.

975
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,760
I don't know what to tell you.

976
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,600
Here's a shiny pebble or whatever the fuck.

977
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,600
Did you read, there's an internet story,

978
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,040
one of those like, nature is beautiful.

979
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,240
Where it was like this crow

980
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
that like befriended a family or something.

981
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,520
And then one day the family like,

982
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
dropped their camera lens cap off of like, a thing.

983
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,640
And they're like, oh no.

984
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,840
And then like, the next day,

985
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
the crow had brought it back to them.

986
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
And that's fucking great, man.

987
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,920
That's beautiful.

988
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Tell me another one, Pawpaw.

989
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,960
That crow was really there for them.

990
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,080
Hey, Pawpaw, will you tell me one about the war?

991
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,760
Well, one time I was down at Foxhole,

992
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
really missing my sweetie.

993
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
And when I woke up the next morning,

994
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,640
a crow had flown my girlfriend over to Germany.

995
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,360
Same crow?

996
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Yeah, and we made love while the crow watched.

997
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
That was the deal.

998
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,640
That was kind of the one stipulation.

999
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,600
So it's like, War Crow, the 2011 movie.

1000
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,040
Did you guys ever see War Crow?

1001
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,400
And my girlfriend got pregnant

1002
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
and we named the baby the crow.

1003
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,760
Did you guys ever see War Crow by Steven Spielberg?

1004
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
The movie where that wartime couple

1005
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,720
made love in front of a crow?

1006
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,440
It had an extended 49-minute long

1007
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,040
Foxhole-based sex scene,

1008
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,880
while it was actually a grackle that they cast.

1009
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,920
A stunt grackle.

1010
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,080
Just watched the whole thing

1011
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
and is, I guess, inspired a generation?

1012
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,220
Yep.

1013
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,120
I have seen some crows around my place lately.

1014
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,440
I was driving home a couple weeks ago

1015
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,480
and there was like 20 crows lined on the road

1016
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,600
blocking my return to my home.

1017
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,240
You know what that means?

1018
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
That was extreme.

1019
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,920
Do you?

1020
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,160
Do you?

1021
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,660
Yeah.

1022
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,800
Gonna be a long, cold summer.

1023
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,040
Long, cold summer.

1024
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,360
But the thing I want to say about crows

1025
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
is when you see a crow in real life,

1026
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,080
it doesn't look like they should be that big.

1027
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
They're extremely big.

1028
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,880
And when you see a crow, it's kind of like,

1029
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,600
whoa, are you sure?

1030
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah, the first time I saw a crow was in War Crow

1031
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
and I wasn't expecting them to have four legs

1032
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,520
and big, meaty haunches and a very long head.

1033
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,560
Is War Crow especially big

1034
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
or is it just he's got a lot of heart?

1035
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,640
He's got a lot of heart.

1036
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,200
Well, it's both.

1037
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,640
It's both.

1038
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,960
He's very large and he cares a great deal.

1039
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,600
And well, no, his physical heart is far too big

1040
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,480
and that's why he dies in the movie.

1041
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
But then they make an apartment out of his heart

1042
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,680
like at the end of James and the Giant Peach.

1043
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,360
I haven't seen War Horse.

1044
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,000
And what's this?

1045
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,720
That's a sequel.

1046
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh, okay.

1047
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,080
Sequel.

1048
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,200
I haven't seen War Horse,

1049
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,080
but I assume from the title,

1050
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,440
it means it's the first and only horse used in war.

1051
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
And that must have been very disconcerting

1052
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,120
for everybody on the battlefield

1053
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,160
the first time that a horse entered.

1054
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
Get that thing the fuck out of here.

1055
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,040
Wait, what do we do with this?

1056
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,920
Can we throw it?

1057
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,280
What are you supposed to do with that?

1058
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm afraid I'm trying to shoot humans.

1059
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,040
I'm gonna hit a beautiful horse.

1060
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,000
To be fair, I was on the other side.

1061
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
If I was on the other side, right?

1062
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
If I was the enemy and suddenly I just saw

1063
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,800
a horse walking towards me,

1064
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
I would lower my gun and be like,

1065
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,920
hey now, what's up?

1066
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,840
But then that horse pulls out a gun,

1067
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,880
shoots the man.

1068
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,200
Dang it.

1069
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm like, oh shit.

1070
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,320
I feel like using a War Horse

1071
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,160
is an abuse of the beautiful relationship

1072
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,200
between a human and a horse.

1073
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,700
Sure.

1074
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,040
They trust you implicitly.

1075
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,880
Your souls are intertwined.

1076
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
You shouldn't be leading them in battle

1077
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,640
against other humans because they will,

1078
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
but they're gonna be up that night like,

1079
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,480
what's going on?

1080
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,960
Unless.

1081
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,320
It's reciprocated.

1082
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,080
If there's a war between horses,

1083
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,360
the horse gets to bring us.

1084
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,680
The sequel to War Horse is Horse War.

1085
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
Yes, Horse War is the sequel.

1086
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,360
And the horse is like,

1087
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,960
I will take you to kill these men,

1088
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,520
but you must promise me that when my people go to war,

1089
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,040
you will be there.

1090
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,120
I will be riding your back at that time.

1091
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,440
I will ride you into battle, Jeff.

1092
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,040
This is my steed, Jeff.

1093
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,640
Whatever you say, Butter Maiden.

1094
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,520
You got it.

1095
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,020
All right.

1096
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,600
Jeff, it's the Butter Maiden.

1097
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,520
The time has come.

1098
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,240
What?

1099
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,040
The time has come.

1100
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,160
Really?

1101
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,280
Holy shit.

1102
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah, dude.

1103
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,760
The fracture between the Calgrani

1104
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,840
and the Bilatush has gone too far.

1105
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,840
There will be no peace.

1106
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,200
You, Jeff.

1107
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,560
Saddle up, Jeff.

1108
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,280
Do you have the long stick of Far Death?

1109
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,320
My gun?

1110
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,960
Yeah, we still-

1111
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,520
Yes.

1112
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,560
Yeah, I still have that.

1113
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,360
Bring it.

1114
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,560
I've seen what it does.

1115
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,360
I bet it will be effective on horse flesh.

1116
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,680
Now put on the saddle, Jeff.

1117
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,160
Enlist your foals.

1118
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,360
No, not on me.

1119
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,920
Do your foals.

1120
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,900
No.

1121
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,400
We've covered that Butter Maiden will be riding Jeff.

1122
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Obviously.

1123
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,400
That's established canon at this point.

1124
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,400
Don't make horses go to war.

1125
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:21,360
I love you.

1126
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,480
Welcome to Munch Squad's podcast,

1127
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,040
the podcast profiling the latest and greatest brand eating.

1128
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,800
We have already talked about the Jelly Belly treasure hunt

1129
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,480
that has nothing to do with Jelly Belly.

1130
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,280
And now it's time for a celebrate good times.

1131
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,840
Come on.

1132
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,480
Sorry, a what?

1133
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,960
It's a celebration.

1134
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,840
Okay, wait, can I guess?

1135
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,240
He just chose Crab Shack?

1136
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,080
No, sir.

1137
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:50,160
Planners unveils a collaboration to celebrate baby nuts.

1138
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
That's what they went with, baby nut?

1139
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,200
Yeah, bud.

1140
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,160
So Mr. Peanut didn't die as he was supposed to,

1141
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,200
but at the same time, Mr. Peanut apparently has had a child

1142
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,280
this whole time named Baby Nut,

1143
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,760
but Baby Nut turned 21 and is now Peanut Jr.

1144
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,520
Wait, are you with me so far?

1145
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,400
Absolutely not.

1146
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,160
Okay.

1147
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,920
Is this like one of those timelines things

1148
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,560
where like one comic book series is about Wolverine,

1149
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,440
but one is about like Logan before he became a Wolverine

1150
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,120
and one is about like Weapon X or these all happening?

1151
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,400
It's all happening at the same time.

1152
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,960
Mr. Peanut had a son.

1153
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,480
The son was named Baby Nut.

1154
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
The son turned 21 and became Peanut Jr.

1155
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
He's got Jack disease.

1156
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,240
No, he's 21 years old.

1157
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
So wait, Mr. Peanut had this son 21 years ago

1158
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,400
and this is just the first time we're hearing about him?

1159
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Was he born out?

1160
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,480
Have you been paying that close of attention to Mr. Peanut?

1161
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,840
Like in every ad if he's like,

1162
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
and also I have a son anyway, eat peanuts.

1163
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,800
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1164
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I will say that this actually makes sense.

1165
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,840
That one time I was watching it was like,

1166
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
we got all kinds of nuts and it makes sense.

1167
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,000
And then he opens the letter and he reads it

1168
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,600
and he kind of crumbles it up and he's like,

1169
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm not ready to accept this responsibility.

1170
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,320
And now I understand what that was in reference to.

1171
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,680
If this Munch Squad were a loading screen,

1172
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,440
it would be at 3% progress.

1173
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,400
I must move on.

1174
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,400
Mr. Peanut has a son.

1175
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,280
His name was Baby Nut.

1176
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,920
He turned 21 and became Peanut Junior.

1177
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,040
Okay, yeah.

1178
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,680
To celebrate this,

1179
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,200
planners today unveiled a limited edition run

1180
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
of beer flavored peanuts co-branded with Natural Light

1181
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,680
as part of a marketing stunt

1182
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,600
surrounding the rapidly aging spokes nut.

1183
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,240
Planners and Natural Light beer flavored peanuts.

1184
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,640
Oh, hey, press release.

1185
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,920
You can't just throw in a term like rapidly aging

1186
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,960
and not make me think of like a Star Trek episode

1187
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,560
or a Doctor Who episode.

1188
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,320
Like, listen, he'll be dead within the week.

1189
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,120
Let him have this.

1190
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,720
So the Natural, I don't want to be classist,

1191
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,000
but Natural Light isn't the best tasting liquid.

1192
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,120
But there's other liquids that I think are superior in taste.

1193
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,520
In fact, other liquids in the beer family.

1194
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,520
In fact, other liquids in the cost-effective,

1195
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,080
low-cost beer family that tastes maybe even

1196
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,800
just a little bit better than old Natty Light.

1197
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
So strange bedfellows.

1198
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,080
Perhaps a Miller High Life.

1199
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,160
It is the Champagne of beers.

1200
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,040
I would take that.

1201
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,120
Or perhaps a PBR, well-known hipster brand.

1202
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,620
Yeah.

1203
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,680
Justin, what else?

1204
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,480
I'm trying to piece this all together,

1205
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,920
but planners, so Baby Nut.

1206
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,420
Baby Nut.

1207
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,880
So, okay.

1208
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,280
All right.

1209
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,720
I'm trying to piece this together.

1210
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,680
Justin, you've got a lot of string tied up on this board here

1211
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
with a lot of pictures going between it.

1212
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,080
Please explain.

1213
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,120
Right.

1214
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,600
Okay.

1215
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,840
So remember when Mr. Peanut died?

1216
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,340
Yes.

1217
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,120
Yeah.

1218
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,600
Okay.

1219
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,800
Worst day of my fucking life.

1220
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,720
So at that time, Baby Nut is what?

1221
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,440
More from the corpse of Mr. Peanut?

1222
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,320
As I understand it?

1223
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,960
Yeah, yeah.

1224
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,280
Totally.

1225
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,000
I didn't want to correct you.

1226
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,400
Death of Superman, then there was Superboy,

1227
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,920
and the Last Crooked Don, and then I believe Steel

1228
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,400
was in there as well, and yeah, of course.

1229
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,000
So he was Baby Nut is what formed from the husk of Mr. Peanut.

1230
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,600
Sorry?

1231
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,400
Like a phoenix.

1232
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,800
Okay, sure.

1233
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,480
That's fine.

1234
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,840
But he formed from the husk of Mr. Peanut,

1235
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:48,720
and then he is transmogrifying now into Peanut Jr.

1236
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,320
Does that make sense?

1237
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,560
Huh.

1238
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,000
You can keep saying it.

1239
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,160
This is, I think, about the fifth time

1240
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,720
that you've tried to walk us through the timeline of Baby Nut.

1241
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,160
So here's the ad.

1242
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,360
Give me 20 seconds.

1243
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,080
Just listen to this.

1244
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,720
Don't say anything.

1245
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,020
I.D.?

1246
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,600
Yes, sir.

1247
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,560
Wait, so you're telling me you fell off a cliff,

1248
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,760
came back to life as a baby, and now you're 21?

1249
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,320
Yeah.

1250
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,280
Yeah, it's been a weird year.

1251
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,640
So Mr. Peanut Jr., he's now 21, and because of that,

1252
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,120
they're making beer nuts that are flavored like the,

1253
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,640
you understand?

1254
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:30,880
Yes.

1255
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,680
Yeah, but if I-

1256
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,920
And it's to celebrate people who miss their birthdays due to COVID.

1257
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,840
That's what this says here.

1258
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,360
That's super, read the exact quote.

1259
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,880
That sounds super nice.

1260
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,440
This comes after Baby Nut, who was introduced in February

1261
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,120
during Planner's controversial Super Bowl ad,

1262
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,280
morphed into Peanut Jr. earlier this month

1263
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,160
as a way to connect with consumers whose birthdays have gone by

1264
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,200
with little to no fanfare due to COVID-19 quarantine measures.

1265
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
That's so sweet.

1266
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,960
That's really nice of them.

1267
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
Can I also just pull back your curtain there a little bit?

1268
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
Because what they're basically saying is like,

1269
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,080
we committed to this like Baby Peanut bit

1270
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,440
and weren't going anywhere with it.

1271
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,760
So as soon as we saw the slimmest off ramp, we took it.

1272
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,800
Right, we took it.

1273
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,920
Now it's Peanut Jr.

1274
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,800
And can I also say just after that ad you played it,

1275
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,680
it does kind of sound like Peanut Jr. is using a fake ID.

1276
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,000
It's very suspicious, yeah.

1277
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
The read on it is definitely like,

1278
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,920
huh, yeah, it's been a weird year.

1279
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,320
Can I have my beer now, please, sir?

1280
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,200
Please.

1281
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,560
At the time when he morphed, the quote was this,

1282
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,640
Peanut Jr. still has a lot to learn,

1283
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,960
like what his favorite go-to drink is,

1284
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,920
as he continues to grow up to become a peanut of the people.

1285
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,420
Jesus.

1286
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,600
And apparently, that was the quote given at that point, right?

1287
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,760
But now we know what his favorite drink is,

1288
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,520
and it's apparently Natty Light.

1289
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,020
Yeah.

1290
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,760
Which actually tracks.

1291
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,200
I mean, it tracks, except for the fact

1292
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,960
that he probably inherited the peanut planter's fortune.

1293
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,520
Yeah.

1294
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,760
And does not need to drink Natty Light.

1295
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,200
Oh, it's ironic.

1296
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,760
Maybe that's what's happening.

1297
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,960
Okay, I would have gone with a Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,

1298
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,800
but that would just be my guess for what baby junior Mr. Peanut is into.

1299
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
So now we're going to go a little bit deeper.

1300
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,880
See, Natural Light is an economy beer brand

1301
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,960
owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev,

1302
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,440
which, like planter's owner Kraft Heinz,

1303
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,120
has ties to Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital.

1304
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,080
Wait a minute.

1305
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,760
This goes all the way to the top.

1306
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,400
It goes all the way to the top, baby.

1307
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,960
5G isn't causing COVID,

1308
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,960
but 3G is causing Natural Light flavored plant's peanuts.

1309
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,400
It goes all the way to the top, and you can buy these nuts.

1310
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,640
It just says here, I tried to click the link,

1311
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,760
it just says you can buy these nuts if you're a dirt bag, it says.

1312
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,240
So I guess if you're a dirt bag, you should be able to find them.

1313
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,560
As is so often the case with MunchSquad,

1314
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,800
now I want to try it.

1315
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,560
I didn't before.

1316
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,440
Nothing goes together.

1317
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,240
This is from Mike,

1318
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,600
executive creative director at Fainter Media,

1319
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,640
which has engineered a lot of evil in the past few years.

1320
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,280
Nothing goes together like beer and nuts.

1321
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,120
We were thrilled to work with Natural Light

1322
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,840
to make the union official with beer flavored peanuts.

1323
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,040
Okay, but it's not like when Cheez-It and House Wine partnered,

1324
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,440
they didn't make wine flavored Cheez-Its.

1325
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,400
That would be actually very good.

1326
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,960
Pretty cool.

1327
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,720
I think I would actually really like that.

1328
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,800
I have had a peanut butter stout before.

1329
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,600
I have had what I would call nut flavored beer.

1330
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,240
Okay, do you like it?

1331
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,600
I am not at all interested.

1332
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,760
It's a weird flex, but okay.

1333
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,520
I'm just saying I'm not at all.

1334
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,160
If someone said,

1335
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,440
do you want me to soak these peanuts in beer before you eat them?

1336
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,000
That's probably not.

1337
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
I would say that sounds disgusting.

1338
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,560
I'd assume the nuts are not soggy and wet, Travis.

1339
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,960
And I'd hope not, but what do you picture?

1340
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,920
It's got beer dust on it?

1341
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,640
Just like a dusting of beer flavor.

1342
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
Like a flavor of beer.

1343
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,800
Like a flavor of beer.

1344
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,840
You know how flavoring works.

1345
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,760
Probably made with beaver anus.

1346
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,520
Why did you say that?

1347
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,320
Why would you say that?

1348
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,360
Oh, they use beaver like anus like juices

1349
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,520
in a lot of fake flavorings.

1350
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
That's so gross, Travis, why do you do that?

1351
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,560
I don't do it.

1352
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,320
You don't do it.

1353
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,720
That is a real thing.

1354
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,400
Now everyone listen to the sound of,

1355
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,320
this is for your ASMR triggers,

1356
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,600
the sound of my brother googling beaver anus.

1357
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,480
I'm doing it quietly on my phone, thank you very much.

1358
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,040
Oh, huh.

1359
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,320
Hey, cool.

1360
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,840
Yeah, I guess so.

1361
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,000
So I guess anything that you eat that has flavor in it,

1362
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,080
you're doing a little, you're just eating ass.

1363
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,920
You thought I was lying, didn't you?

1364
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,280
You thought I was wrong.

1365
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,560
I don't know what I thought.

1366
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,400
All right.

1367
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,560
Wow, yeah, look at that.

1368
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:53,920
Why?

1369
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,600
Why, is it good?

1370
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,840
Who discovered this?

1371
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,960
That's what I need to know.

1372
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,920
Who's like, that's actually, I wanted to eat,

1373
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,000
I said I would eat the entire beaver on a dare,

1374
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,120
but I'm enjoying the ass more than I thought I would.

1375
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,160
I just happened to have on my desk

1376
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,600
that I've been snacking on a little bit,

1377
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,400
some jelly beans.

1378
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,800
Those are going right in the fucking garbage can.

1379
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,480
Is beaver anus in jelly bellies?

1380
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,000
It's in Haribo.

1381
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,280
I think I'm okay.

1382
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,800
Okay.

1383
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,480
Oh, jelly beans have a shellac on them

1384
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,800
that is made from the secretions of a bug.

1385
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,240
Okay.

1386
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,520
A bee, a beeswax?

1387
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,240
No.

1388
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,960
If you see an ingredient titled confectioner's glaze,

1389
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,840
see if that's on your jelly beans.

1390
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,960
It's in there, yeah, they do.

1391
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,120
I mean, I'd rather eat bugs than eat out a beaver's butt.

1392
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,720
I don't know them.

1393
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,360
You know what I mean?

1394
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,000
How come it's just beavers?

1395
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,360
How come God gave the beaver the most flavorful butt glands?

1396
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,720
I don't know.

1397
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,040
Here we are.

1398
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,600
Here we are.

1399
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
Well, in this truth all together.

1400
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,160
This is the worst episode that we've put out so far.

1401
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,440
Just because of the truths contained within?

1402
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,040
I mean, I think all around,

1403
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,720
I don't think there's anything redemptive

1404
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,400
about what happened before this.

1405
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,640
Like everything we said in the episode

1406
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,720
doesn't balance out the whole beaver butt thing.

1407
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,240
No, God no, Christ no.

1408
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,680
No, I mean, we would have to give out

1409
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,280
the winning lotto ticket numbers or something.

1410
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,160
Okay, this is the thing.

1411
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,200
There's a food dye in Nerds

1412
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,280
that's made from crushed and boiled beetles.

1413
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,320
Yeah.

1414
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,880
Sure.

1415
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,760
All right.

1416
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,720
So we're all fucking nasty, nasty Timon and Pumbaa.

1417
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,520
Let's end it, the show and episode.

1418
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,840
Now to be fair, Griffin, you have numerous times said

1419
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,000
that Timon and Pumbaa made you want to eat those beetles.

1420
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,440
You want to eat those bugs.

1421
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,840
Yeah, well, now you've got the opportunity, thanks to Nerds.

1422
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,600
But I want to be able to give consent to Timon and Pumbaa

1423
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,640
before I eat the bugs.

1424
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,840
I don't want them tricking me.

1425
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,960
Yeah, not like, yeah.

1426
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,960
You gotta watch this, too.

1427
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,560
Try this, Simba.

1428
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,760
It's beaver ass.

1429
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,080
It's beaver ass.

1430
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,720
It's the one thing we love out here on the savanna.

1431
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,560
Beaver ass.

1432
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,800
Hakuna my ass.

1433
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,960
Delicious.

1434
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,080
Uh, I think I'm going to go back and deal with Scar.

1435
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,240
No, he won't have you anymore.

1436
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,200
You've been sullied.

1437
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,720
You better eat this.

1438
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,680
He'll know you ate the ass.

1439
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:28,960
He'll know.

1440
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,720
If you go back, we're going to tell everybody

1441
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,160
you ate the ass and loved it.

1442
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,840
Beaver ass pancakes.

1443
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,280
Beaver ass tortillas.

1444
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,480
Beaver ass tacos.

1445
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,600
We got everything.

1446
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,320
Something smells like vanilla ice cream,

1447
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,080
which almost universally contains beaver ass.

1448
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,240
It's me, Scar.

1449
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,360
I ate the beaver ass.

1450
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,680
Mufasa's like, don't eat the beaver ass.

1451
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,120
I thought I told you.

1452
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,160
What, ghost dad?

1453
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,280
I've missed you so much.

1454
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,560
You come back to talk to me.

1455
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,640
I told you to never eat beaver ass.

1456
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,600
I reject you.

1457
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,400
I can no longer recognize you as my heir.

1458
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,480
Just want back to say I'm disappointed.

1459
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,480
Anyway, bye.

1460
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,880
Hi, it's me, the beaver.

1461
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,400
I'm up here with your dad,

1462
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
and I can't believe you ate my ass.

1463
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,840
I'm dead and you ate my ass.

1464
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,000
The king.

1465
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,280
You're no king.

1466
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,240
That's what Rafiki is wiping on him, by the way,

1467
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,760
just in case anyone was wondering.

1468
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,080
It's a mixture of beetles and beaver ass.

1469
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,280
You're nasty.

1470
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,080
Go out into the world.

1471
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,680
This is Scar's entire plan,

1472
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,400
is to trick Simba into eating beaver ass

1473
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,920
and then tell everybody,

1474
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,520
well, it looks like you've beaten me,

1475
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,520
but before I surrender,

1476
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,360
just one more thing.

1477
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,560
Just one more thing.

1478
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,240
Yes, I told all the giraffes

1479
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,720
that you ate beaver ass and also geese.

1480
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,240
They know now,

1481
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,560
and the beavers were not thrilled.

1482
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,360
Let me tell you.

1483
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,640
Well, some of them were,

1484
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,720
but you don't know how they are.

1485
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,240
Some of them are extremely flexible

1486
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,560
on a moral spectrum.

1487
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,800
Thank you for listening

1488
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,400
to what is presumably not been canceled, a podcast by us,

1489
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,320
the McElroy brothers called My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1490
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,920
We hope you have enjoyed your time with us

1491
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,640
as we continue to soldier on

1492
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,440
through this absolutely bizarre period in our planet.

1493
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,040
We wrote a book about how to podcast.

1494
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,120
It is like a guide that will actually

1495
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,480
walk you through step by step,

1496
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,440
but we wrote it, so it's also kind of funny.

1497
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,040
I think you'll like reading it.

1498
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,720
Hey, I'll say it.

1499
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,080
You will like reading it.

1500
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,280
You can pre-order it at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

1501
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,360
What are you waiting for?

1502
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,160
Go do that.

1503
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,320
Let's see, what else?

1504
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,000
Thank you to John Roderick in the Long Winters

1505
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,800
for the use of our theme song

1506
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,760
as a departure off the album,

1507
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,280
Putting the Days to Bed.

1508
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,440
You can find that on the internet

1509
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,240
and a bunch of different places, I bet.

1510
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,320
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1511
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,280
Go to MaximumFun.org,

1512
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,480
check out all the great shows there,

1513
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,000
shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1514
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,040
And Heat Rocks, and a whole bunch more.

1515
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,800
All at MaximumFun.org.

1516
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,760
Also, we got some good new merch up

1517
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,120
there at the McElroyMerch.com store,

1518
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,080
including some bee pins that represent the three of us

1519
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,720
and our dad as a horrible bee monster.

1520
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,000
So make sure you check that out.

1521
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Don't forget to get registered to vote

1522
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,360
and vote early.

1523
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,880
And make sure you do some research on local elections

1524
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,160
because it starts local, then moves up the chain.

1525
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,320
Plus there's a lot of Senate seats up for grabs

1526
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,480
and then vote for Joe Biden.

1527
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,600
Thank you for being here.

1528
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,280
We hope you're hanging in there doing okay.

1529
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,040
Don't forget artists.

1530
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,000
I will use the teeth.

1531
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
Teeth owner, get at us.

1532
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
This final Yahoo.

1533
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,440
We're not narcs, this isn't a sting.

1534
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,720
No, it would be a very weird roundabout sting if it was.

1535
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,160
This one was sent in by the wizard Emma Cant.

1536
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,920
Thank you Emma, it's Yahoo Answers user.

1537
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,800
Another anonymous one,

1538
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,400
stop being so fucking scared and do and stand up for yourself

1539
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,200
for once.

1540
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
Billup asks,

1541
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,600
does anyone really believe it's a coincidence

1542
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,120
that the two surviving beetles are the circumcised one?

1543
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:29,040
I could not have for money told you where that was going.

1544
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,080
My name is Justin.

1545
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,840
Hi Travis, I'm Griffin McElroy.

1546
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,960
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

1547
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,800
may kiss your dad's square in the lips.

1548
00:59:36,800 --> 01:00:00,880
Hey girls, do you wanna just say that I wanna?
