1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin Penelope McElroy.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Justin, you were just telling us before we started recording, and you expressed some hesitance to actually want to talk about this on the program.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That you have just purchased a new vehicle, and I think there's a lot of legs here.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I hope there's not a lot of legs on the car, Griffin.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It could be a fucking My Neighbor Totoro cat bus, but no, it's probably a four-wheeled vehicle car.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And I just wanted to sort of dive into like the decision, because I know you're such a gearbox.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I know that you really like to get into these vehicles and really inspect them, bumper-to-bumper guarantee.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, for sure.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And just go over all the parts and try and maximize the efficiency.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
See how the parts go? Yeah, upgradability, being able to put some turbo in there is huge to me.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Usually you wanna make sure that it's got room for turbo, because you buy a car and the trunk's all full of parts already, you don't have room for turbo.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Where's the nocks go? Where's the nocks? The nocks.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So walk me through sort of the decision-making process that you went through that led you down the winding road to your new whip.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I almost bought a Honda Odyssey, which is a minivan, because it had a built-in vacuum in it. Have you ever heard of such a thing?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So a built-in vacuum, how does, like, the engine has a vacuum to suck the fuel up into the engine to make it go faster?

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, there's a vacuum in the back that you can pull out, it's got a huge tube, and you turn on the engine and it just sucks.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And you can clean up all the baby detritus.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's fun, because you can look at your friends and they'd be like, why did you buy this? And you would say, because this car sucks.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And you would all have a good laugh. Or a medium laugh.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So it's not, like, for going, it's for, like, Cheez-Its.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, it's like, I almost got this car because it had a built-in vacuum.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What was the engine like on that one, though?

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, it used gas.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, man, you got it.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, Justin, quick question about this vehicle. I know you didn't go with it, but is it got hemi?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, if I wanted to go farther, I could stop in pretty much any gas station.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, hell yes.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Actually, I wasn't planning on buying a new vehicle, but I had to because the Germans tried to kill the planet with my car.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They made my car into a planet-killing sleeper agent.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hold on, don't blame that on all Germans.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It was the Germans.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, they zagged on me and Justin pretty hard with these VWs.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was a pretty big zag.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mine is killing the planet.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's definitely draining Gaia of the live stream or whatever, but it goes so fast and I like how it looks.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your unwillingness to part with this car has been fascinating to me because I was so stoked when they offered to take it back from me

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because I bought it during, I guess, Sydney and I were having a simultaneous midlife crisis

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and we bought this convertible Beetle that you can't put a car seat in and then we had a baby, so that was whack.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then the Germans lied and they killed the planet with my car.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They zagged you, yeah.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Plus, isn't someone offering to take your car away and give you money back for it so you can get a different car?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Even if you love your car, just like, I can just do a different car now?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Not if you just bought it a year ago and you don't like car shopping.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Anyway, Justin loves car shopping and I want to get back into it.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, tell me about the vehicle that you did end up, any other candidates that you were thinking about just based on sort of their specs?

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hi, if you're just joining us, welcome to Car Talk, the new Car Talk 2.0.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Car Talk Extreme Baja Blast.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, basically, I was thinking also about Kia Sorento.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now, that's a very fuckable ride.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, you know, we were looking for something with three rows that wouldn't be too terrible, you know?

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, I was thinking about maybe a Kia Sorento, but we ended up going with a Honda Pilot.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's the spoiler like on that?

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Spoiler, I love it.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just a great ride all around.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's another car joke that I got.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And how's this baby hump the road?

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When you get her out there and you're taking the turns through the country, is she humping the road or nah?

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I basically just drive it from my house to Rite Aid and back.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, what kind of like, you time that?

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, I can get from my house to Rite Aid in like five minutes, which is about how long it took with my last car.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Nice.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This one has three rows, so that's nice.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's the engine smell like when it heats up?

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, it's a good one, Trav.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You know, just like a motor burning.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Head out on the highway, you know?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you want me to say freedom? I mean, it's just a Honda Pilot.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Gas-wise, gas-wise, are we talking diesel or are we talking about that regular tan stuff?

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or like old french fry stuff?

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm never buying a diesel car again.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Nobody sells diesel.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Never buying that again.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry the Germans tricked me into killing the planet with diesel. Sorry.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Diesel's good for the planet. The planet drinks that shit up.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's what they try to tell me. Try to sell me on that.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have you done any sort of mods?

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I know like you are a real gearbox and I love you.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I know that you like to get under the hood and under the car.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, they have the little dolly that you lay down on and I see you sometimes just sliding around on that.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just having like the best day ever.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
When you're hanging with your crew.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, your pit crew.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, I have made a couple of additions in there.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, nice.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
One of the things was it didn't have, well, my garage door opener wasn't clipped to the thing.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Little salvage job from the last whip.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And that's going to pick you up like two or three miles per hour just right there.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, and then also it didn't have any disc in the...

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And the tires, those are called rims.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There was no disc in the Blu-ray player and then I swapped that not having a disc out with Peppa Pig Muddy Puddles and other stories.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nice.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, so I did that swap.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And how does that tweak the torque? Pretty good?

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's booming actually.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can really feel it when they jump in those muddy puddles.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can feel it, the sound system.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The tweeters and woofers and stuff are really booming on that.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now, Justin, when you're doing your illegal street racing and you really hit the height of that Peppa Pig episode,

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
do you feel like that's the boost you need to get you over that old finish line?

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Just a second question to add onto that.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is it also the closest that you feel to seeing God's face?

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sometimes I confuse the voice of Daddy Pig with the voice of God because they've both got very low rumbles.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Just when you're in that speed zone.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sure.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
When you're transcending.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I would actually like to mention that I had to do a pretty sad...

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is pretty savage actually.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I had to bring back the car, the Beetle, and I had to walk through the dealership and they had already closed

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and they were just sitting around.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is where my appointment was.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They were all sitting around, just chatting, and they asked me how they could help me.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I had to tell them, I'm here to sell back my car to you.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Take this car from me.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They looked very downtrodden and dejected.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The Honda dealership is actually on the same lot, so I just walked out the door and walked over to the other place.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Just waving a wad of cash in front of you.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey, listen, these suckers just bought back my Beetle.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Got them.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Justin, I'm so happy for you.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know you love your beautiful toys.

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're a real Jay Leno.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just really excited for you to just have a new canvas to sort of do your art on.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Whatever you do, don't get out there and start racing for pinks again.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
One thing that is hard is if my garage door is open and I try to open the back of the car,

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
there's not enough room, so I have to mod either the garage door or the car.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So now you're hoping that there's a secret planet-killing device inside of this car so that you can fix this mistake you've made.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, this is a big whiff.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to have to try again.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's not a bad car shopping technique.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not looking for city versus highway miles per gallon.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not looking for any kind of aesthetic.

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm looking for the car that secretly has a device inside of it that is killing the planet so that in like a year or so I can get another free new whip.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, the only MPGs I care about is mendacity per gallon.

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I just want to know how many lies you can stuff in there.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So when I uncover the lot, when some enterprising gearhead like myself discovers the lies that you hid in your car, it's like leasing.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's lysing.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's just like you find cars with lies in them.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's fleecing.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's fleecing.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There we go.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There we found it.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Can we please do a show?

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I warned you guys it wouldn't be funny.

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Dude, no, you did good, and it was funny, and I loved it.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It was good.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Justin.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm a pretty practical car shopper at this point.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Listen, I had my fun with my 1982 Malibu and my 1992 Cutlass Sierra.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have owned that Cutlass Sierra.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I had a lot of work in.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I had a lot of fun with my Kia Sophia and my Kia Sportage.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Listen, I've had my fun, you know, my fun cars, and now my Subaru Outback.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now I'm just ready to like settle down with a little more grown-up ride.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How about some questions?

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I've wasted my youth.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, brothers.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I recently started up a band with a couple of friends of mine.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm the lead singer.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fuck yeah.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Slash guitarist, slash songwriter.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The problem is our bassist isn't very good.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Listen, I see where this is going.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The answer is yes.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will take the job.

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Here, let me give you a sample.

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hi.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sorry, are you finished?

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, hold on.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Wait a minute.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wow, he was pretty good.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My name's Griffin, and I'd also like to apply for the job.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I would also like to throw my hat in the ring, please.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass, bass.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey, you've got a sound we've never heard before.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We must have you.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you very much.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
One million dollars.

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The actual problem is what's worse is he frequently argues with me about how our songs, which I wrote, should sound.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I try my best to take his opinion into account, but most of the time his take on a song is flat out bad.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I feel really bad kicking him out.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How can I deal with this without breaking up the band?

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's from Cacophonus in Canada.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Liam, Liam, I love this Wonderwall song.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Have you thought about doing it very, very fast?

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And maybe super happy.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Super fast and happy, and also very loud electric guitars.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's whiny in it.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's a little whiny in it.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What if it was much faster, like 210 BPM?

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What if you did it more like Pharrell?

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You like Pharrell?

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You like Pharrell?

207
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've been listening to a lot of Pharrell.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What if we called it the Thunderwall?

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What if we got LMFAO to do a verse?

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, that'd be nice.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That'd be good.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Actually, this song sounds fucking really good.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thunderwall by LMFAO, a 210 BPM fucking trance hit featuring Oasis.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It'll be on the Facebook group by the end of the week.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You often hear about bands that get famous and then kick somebody out.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And then you hear about bands that kick somebody out and then get famous.

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm thinking of Pete Best that happened with Pete Best.

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The original drummer from the Oneaters?

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, the original drummer.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, this is good.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The Metallica kicks out Dave Mustaine, they get huge.

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Beatles kick out Pete Best, they get huge.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oneaters kick out the original drummer, they get huge.

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm thinking maybe this guy from where he's not very good at it

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and causing discord, thank you, within the band.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Maybe if you kick him out, the band would be better?

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Maybe?

228
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And you would get famous right away?

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He's the catalyst.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is such a precarious situation because you are the songwriter,

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
lead singer, head of the band, right?

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But you don't want to come off as a complete prick, right?

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I get that.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I think you do have to walk a pretty delicate line here.

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now, on the other side of things, where the fuck does this bassist get off?

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Where the fuck does this bassist get off?

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I love a good bassist.

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I mean, shit, some of my favorites are very important to me,

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
but I'm going to keep them a secret.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's not what a bassist do though.

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
McCartney was a bassist, right?

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then Beatles, I guess he probably had a few things to say.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Or was that Harrison?

244
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry, I have to stop you guys.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm very uncomfortable right now because you're both just kind of like

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
casually endorsing bassism.

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, Jesus.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hi, everybody.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's Travis McElroy here.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I would like to jump in now and say a thing.

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm quitting the show and doing my own spinoff of a bit.

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's just me saying bad puns.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's called Believe It or Not, I'm Doing My Best.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
With Pete Best.

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
With Pete Best.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
With Travis McElroy, Pete Best.

258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Boy, we just couldn't get it together, could we?

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Nope.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And look how much more successful everybody else is doing now.

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Okay, I've never formed a band before.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have no idea what goes into it.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But what's the pre-probe before you let somebody into a band like this

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
that you only later find out, like, oh, you're not good at music.

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Whoops.

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Like, isn't that a thing that you should find out free-forming?

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want you to imagine it or something for me, okay?

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're you, okay?

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And you're doing – somebody's like, I know a cool bassist.

270
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And you're like, okay, great.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And he gets up and you're like, show me what you got.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And he's like, brum brum brum brum brum brum brum.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And you're like, okay, cool.

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It sounds like you got it.

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like, there's no way to tell if he's good at it or not.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wait, you're saying there's no way to tell if a bassist is good?

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, you can't tell if a bassist is good or not.

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Well.

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sorry.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We're living in 2020 when we have to do a bass arts thing where we pay $500 to bassists

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to make up for everything we've said about them in the past.

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, I love a fucking fresh bass line.

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like, there's some good – you're saying there's no way to tell if a bassist is good?

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What are you talking about?

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I know who good bassists are.

287
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They do, like, Flea.

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He's good.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Bootsy Collins.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Geddy Lee.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like, there's a lot of very good bassists out there that play the bass, and it sounds

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
good when they play it.

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Vic Wooten.

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay, now you're looking at a fucking Google list.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No, I know Vic Wooten.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, yeah.

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He played with – what's that guy's name?

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Dad likes him.

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bella Fleck.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, yeah.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah, no, that's very, very talented.

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We're digging ourselves a bassist hole, and I want to get out of it.

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm just kidding.

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm doing, like, old jokes about bassists.

306
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I know that you all have had it rough, and I'm sorry about piling on here.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't mean it, and I don't want to hear from you.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
More importantly –

309
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
More importantly, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to be educated.

310
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, please.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I've learned so much and grown so much.

312
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can afford to write off this group of people.

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, that's not – you already have that group of people, and it's jugglers.

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't get a second slot.

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But please, don't educate.

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't want to know.

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Here's the question.

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Here's the question for Question Writer.

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because you really have to take a long, hard look in the mirror and decide,

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
do you think that this band is going to go somewhere, or is this a fun –

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
like, we get together on the weekends, you know, maybe three times a month if we can swing it

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and make the schedule work, play some songs together, drink some beers,

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and then we usually end up playing Mario Kart kind of thing.

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Because if it's that second one, it's going to be fine.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Just, like, breathe deep and, like, listen to their shitty suggestions

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and then just go on with whatever.

327
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It'll be fine.

328
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If you actually think, like, no, this is what I want to do for a living,

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
this is my career, and then we're really trying to make a go of this,

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
then you have to take that into account, and you've got to cut this person loose.

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Because if this is your job and they are not good at it and they are hard to work with,

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the last thing you want is, like, you play a concert and someone's like, hey, that's great.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I would love to sign you guys.

334
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And now you are stuck with them forever, and, like, that is what tears your band apart in two years

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
because you can't stand one member of it.

336
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, it's funny.

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
One of the things that you – like, when you're creating something,

338
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
one of the things that I have learned and this – I have found –

339
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've discovered, like, why some people who are actually celebrities, I think,

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
get the reputation of being, like, hard to work with, I think.

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because I think when you're creating something and it's a collaborative thing,

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
especially, like, if you're writing the songs and creating that stuff,

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
other – you think about your own stuff probably 50 to 100 times more than other people think about it.

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But when you're working on it together, they want to have equal say in it.

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I think that it's okay if you're creating something and you have, like, an idea of what you want to create.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think it's okay for you to relax some of the, like, social convention of, like, how people normally, like, interact.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't think it's inconsiderate, I guess is what I'm saying, or inhumane to have a creative vision

348
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and want people who are going to, like, support it and help you realize it rather than try to fight you at every corner.

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's not to say that, you know, something can't be gained through conflict,

350
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
because I think that creative work is filled with stories like that.

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I do think that if it's not gelling with this person and you're serious about this, then, you know, there's –

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
it's not like – it's like – it's a professional setting, you know.

353
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They're not working for the project that you're doing.

354
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think you should feel bad about making that clear.

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Kick them the fuck out, and maybe you'll be doing them a favor and they'll be like Pete Best,

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
who started a band called The Better Beatles, and they were – they were. They were better.

357
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They did White Album too. We Did It Better This Time. Two Revolvers. Do you remember that album?

358
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you remember Two Revolvers?

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's the one that's better than Revolver?

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, because they had two guns the whole time.

361
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I hope Paul McCartney never dies. Obviously. But I think –

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Full stop.

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Full stop. I want to make that clear up front.

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But I think we all know deep down he will die before Ringo Starr does.

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like, I think we're all pretty clear about that happening. I just hope –

366
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He will win the Tontine.

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah. I just hope – and that Tontine is this.

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I just hope that Ringo Starr has the guts to do a solo tour marketed as a Beatles reunion tour.

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I just want – I just want – and here's the thing. No other instruments can be on stage.

370
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It is just Ringo Starr playing drums –

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And he also does like the few harmonies, so it's just like –

372
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That sounds – again, that sounds –

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That sounds fucking good.

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I didn't know you were a bassist and a drummer.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All right. So listen. Right? Peace and love. Peace and love. I want the –

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The left third of the auditorium, you're George, okay? So like, you do George stuff.

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And middle third, you're – John was him. And then right third, you're Paul.

378
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So you do Paul stuff, and I'm just going to do Ringo stuff.

379
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
All right. I hate to stop you again.

380
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You were a little off, George, part of the crowd. Please get it together.

381
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Hey, George. Hey, whichever one of you Georgians is fucking up, raise your hand.

382
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
All right. You have to leave the concert because you're dragging us down.

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
74 of you are fired from the band. The best Beatles.

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Take that, BeatBest. Put that in your fucking pipe.

385
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But you wish you thought of that name, didn't you? You're a bastard.

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay. Yahoo time. I got one here from level 9000.

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you, Drew. It's by Yajuransersuser.

388
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Parami, and I don't think it's going to be a meaty one,

389
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
but it's something we need to fucking discuss right now.

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Parami asks, I just heard the new company is finally taking over Yahoo.

391
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What will happen to our emails and Yahoo Answers? This saddens me. Saw it on the news.

392
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I saw it on the news this morning that Verizon's company, that Alibaba or Aldaba

393
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or whatever the hell it's called will be replacing Yahoo here in a few.

394
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I hate this so much. I hate it. I love answering questions on Yahoo Answers.

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Me too. I fucking love being a member of this community,

396
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and I don't know what Altauba is going to do with it now that they are Yahoo,

397
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and I'm not sure what the business arrangement here.

398
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I know Melissa Mayer is on the way out, and she has been a stalwart guardian.

399
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
She was the one behind, I don't know if you guys know this,

400
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
there's a new app called Yahoo Answers Now.

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Hello, Yahoo Answers Now. I'm so glad to meet you.

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm glad you came out like a couple months ago when the fucking fires are the hottest,

403
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
when the Yahoo Answers sun has reached its zenith in the sky.

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But now she's gone. Altauba's here. Nobody quite knows what's going to happen to Yahoo Answers,

405
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but I'll tell you what's going to happen. It's gone. It's gone.

406
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's going to die and be gone, and then this podcast is going to die and be gone.

407
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You can't just turn off a website, Griffin.

408
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Sorry?

409
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You can't just stop a website.

410
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You can't stop the signal?

411
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You can't stop the signal, Griffin.

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What are they going to do, just not anymore?

413
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What's that even look like? You know what I mean?

414
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, I guess they've already uploaded all the data to the web.

415
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's not like a building you can tear down.

416
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They're not going to close their doors.

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let's really think about this, though.

418
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's not like they can just suck the data back down from the web.

419
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Once you put the data up there, it's like up there.

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm trying to work through this. I have Yahoo Answers tabs open on my computer right now.

421
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I have the data. They can't take it off my computer, right?

422
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is Altaba going to come and destroy my MacBook?

423
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
No. It's important to note that Yahoo, the company,

424
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
sold its verticals and its internet business and all that stuff to Verizon.

425
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So, Verizon bought that stuff.

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yes.

427
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What's left is Altaba.

428
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, I don't think Altaba will have any connection to Yahoo, the entity.

429
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay. So, where does that leave my precious Altaba Ants?

430
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Just saying that. It felt like poop falling out of my mouth.

431
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Altaba Ants.

432
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Awful, awful mouthfeel.

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What's going to happen to it, Justin?

434
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because you know more about this business.

435
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I know I'm the Forbes 30 under 30 luminary, but you are like Bloomberging out.

436
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's actually the Washington Post that I'm reading, but yeah, for sure.

437
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Fuck.

438
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah. So, it's going to be Altaba.

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Am I going to be able to get on here and find out what to do because I shoved a whole 18-inch pizza up my butt?

440
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Am I still going to have this utility available to me?

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Can we agree that Yahoo was never a very good name, or do we think it was a good name?

442
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I mean, they had that fun theme song where it was like, yeah, whoo, whoo.

443
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't think you can call that a theme song, Griffin.

444
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah, sure you can, dude.

445
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, you can.

446
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Top 10 TV theme songs of all time.

447
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay.

448
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Scrubs.

449
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's my favorite TV theme song.

450
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

451
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So, I'm just really worried.

452
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I know there's not much to talk about here, and there's a lot of uncertainty in the air,

453
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
but I didn't want the next episode of MyBimBam to be like, and here's an Altaba answers,

454
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and there's no groundwork for it, you know?

455
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's just some things are important.

456
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I have another guy who does that.

457
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Words don't mean things.

458
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Hold on, though.

459
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I don't want to leave it there.

460
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Zag, what if Altaba comes in and like turns this shit around and suddenly everybody's username loads on the first time every time?

461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And there's no more, you'll never believe that Melissa McCarthy is dead ads that pop up, you know?

462
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, my God.

463
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That's my dream, but I'd still have to say Altaba answer.

464
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Altaba.

465
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Altaba.

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Altaba answers.

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I feel like an asshole just saying it.

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Alt answers.

469
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No, then it's no.

470
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No.

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay, I'm going to read another Altaba.

472
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm just going to practice it so that like when it does switch over, it's normal.

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Here's an Altaba answers from another one from Altaba.

474
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Level 9000, Altaba Druid.

475
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
See fucking.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Drew Davenport, thank you.

477
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's from the Nikki Bella who asks.

478
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't think this is the wrestler woman, but she asks.

479
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Is Ronald McDonald a virgin or did he lose his virginity?

480
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
This is the stuff that like, I don't want to be gone.

481
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It can't be gone.

482
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't know that.

483
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I want, but if he did, it was with Wendy.

484
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
All right.

485
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Like, do we finally go too deep for you, Travis?

486
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Maybe.

487
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This might be.

488
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Was it with Wendy or was it with the Taco Bell dog?

489
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No, it was.

490
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Here's my question, you guys.

491
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Maybe it's with the Burger King.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Hello.

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Do you think that this is why there have been different iterations of Ronald McDonald over the year that when he gives away his treasure, his toy surprise.

494
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah.

495
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Then they have to like, he is then free to leave and a new Ronald McDonald is brought in.

496
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.

497
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like this, like the Dread Pirate Roberts.

498
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So is there a test you could do on Ronald McDonald's to see if they're still virginal?

499
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now, would this be some sort of medical swab or what are you suggesting?

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Or some kind of like word puzzle?

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I think you could just ask him because I don't think he can lie.

502
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He cannot lie to a child.

503
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
No, well, we'd need a child to ask him because he can't lie to a child.

504
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
A child has to ask him if he's had sex and he can't lie to a child.

505
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
No, absolutely not.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And also, if he's lost his virginity, French fries turn to ash in his mouth.

507
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You have to wait until you see the white smoke come out of the chimney of Burger King.

508
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

509
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What is Burger King going to say?

510
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Well, they just announce it because it's weird for McDonald's to talk about.

511
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And I also meant to say McDonald's.

512
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just sort of acoustically, I can tell.

513
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Are you talking like, is your face in your hands in disgust right now?

514
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's basically sort of, my hands are here.

515
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They're sort of rubbing my head.

516
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm just thinking about if we can come back from this.

517
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I mean, the McDonald's sponsorship is out.

518
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I think we can all agree that now that ship is sailed, correct?

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I mean, I don't, I would be, I'm fine with that.

520
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm, you know, I'm scrupled.

521
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Me and fucking Spurlock, me and Morgan Spurlock hanging out all the time.

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
If that fool sees me with a big and tasty in my gob, he will never, he'll cut me off.

523
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He will think you're eating a five-year-old hamburger, which would be a bit, yeah, that would be...

524
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What if McDonald's though, the ad campaign for 2017 was, he did it.

525
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I'm not saying in the commercial we have to see Ronald McDonald making love.

526
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm just saying like, like the new commercial is that same Ronald McDonald, do you believe in magic, man?

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But now he's, he's wearing like some fucking cool blue jeans and he's just like walking down the street all smooth.

528
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Slick back, you know, and he's wearing some real cool like Warby Parker shades.

529
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah. And it's like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, he did it.

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Call me Ron now.

531
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Call me Ron now. I made love.

532
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I want to paint the ad for you. Allow me to paint this picture.

533
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah.

534
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We light up on a sad little, probably seven-year-old boy sitting on a bench outside of Mickey D's.

535
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And he's like, obviously downtrodden, he's wearing a medal that says second place in soccer.

536
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And he's obviously...

537
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Wait, the medal says second place in soccer.

538
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can you please not interrupt me while I'm doing my ad?

539
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The medal says second place in soccer.

540
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay.

541
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then you hear like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

542
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And Ron McDonald sits down next to him.

543
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Ron McDonald.

544
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He pops his collar and he's like, hey, kid, you having a rough day?

545
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And the kid's like, yeah, I guess you could say that, Ron.

546
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And Ron says, well, I know just the thing that could turn that around.

547
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And the kid's like, burgers and fries from McDonald's?

548
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And Ron says, um, yeah, that could work too, I guess.

549
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And then he, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
As he lowers his shade and looks right at the camera, freeze frame.

551
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Uh-huh.

552
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And then the new tagline that he says directly to the camera is, McDonald's, it's what kids have to do to feel good.

553
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
He puts his sunglasses...

554
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then like, it fades to black.

555
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And then the lights come back up and he's still got his sunglasses down.

556
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And he's like, but not adults, if you know what I mean.

557
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And he wakes and then black out and then the lights come back up and he's still got his sunglasses down.

558
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And he says, I mean, have sex.

559
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I did it.

560
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I did it.

561
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Good too.

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Now read my new book.

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Let me fucking paint you a new ad picture, okay?

564
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay.

565
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's the jack-in-the-box man.

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And he's doing his fucking bullshit, right?

567
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He's like dressed up as a fucking cowboy.

568
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He's advertising a new meal where you can get four tacos and a stank burger and a big old plate of spaghetti all for $1.

569
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And he's like doing his like funny bit and everybody's like having a good time laughing.

570
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And who's that driving down the street in a big stretch limo?

571
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Well, the back window rolls down and you see just like a sweaty Ron and he's not wearing a shirt.

572
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And he just looks at the jack-in-the-box man kind of condescendingly.

573
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And you can tell that he's like making love in there.

574
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And then like the window rolls up and he drives up and then it's ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

575
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
He's doing it.

576
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And it's not a jack-in-the-box commercial anymore.

577
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So McDonald's buys a commercial app from underneath them.

578
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes.

579
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Or another one could be the fucking creepy Burger King King is like peering through a window.

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And who's in that window?

581
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's a mid-coitus Ron.

582
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And you don't see him.

583
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You never see him but you hear sort of some squeaking and some low moaning.

584
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think a good way to keep this campaign moving because I don't want the campaign to stall.

585
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's so important to reinvent.

586
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I think you've seen all the classic ads sort of run out.

587
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Even like ones people love like where's the beef or whatever.

588
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
They run out of steam eventually.

589
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Bo knows that you know I could name other ads but I feel like we keep the campaign moving forward

590
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
where each ad Ronald discovers a new sex thing.

591
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So he's like more it's like ba-da-bum-bum-bum.

592
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There's more holes and he's like excited that he's excited he found other holes.

593
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And then he's like ba-da-bum-bum-bum.

594
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Not just women.

595
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You can do it with guys too.

596
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You could do it with basically anybody that's willing.

597
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And like in every commercial he finds a new sex thing that he's excited about.

598
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And then the last commercial he has to learn to love himself.

599
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Exactly.

600
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
By which I mean masturbation.

601
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I could have just been doing this the whole time.

602
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I could have done this the whole time.

603
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
All right.

604
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So that and that was that one.

605
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That was that.

606
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That was that bit.

607
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That bit is that.

608
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That was what you heard earlier was the end of it.

609
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That was the end of it.

610
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This is after it.

611
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This is after it.

612
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I hope you all.

613
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Another classic bit in the books.

614
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That but we're done.

615
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We're done.

616
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Come on.

617
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Let's go.

618
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Come on get in the car.

619
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We're going.

620
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm going to tell you about nature box.

621
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Nature box is the best place to go to get snacks that taste great and are better for you.

622
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Made with high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors flavors or sweeteners.

623
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So you can feel great about snacking.

624
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
They have a ton of really great snacks.

625
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I have a few bags on hand right now.

626
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Got some dark chocolate almonds that are really good.

627
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Got some salt and pepper pop pops.

628
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I've got some raspberry whole wheat figgy bars.

629
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I've got some big island pineapple.

630
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Really into the big island pineapple.

631
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's just like dried pineapple rings but they're good as hell.

632
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If fruit roll ups were good it could be big island pineapple.

633
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's really simple.

634
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
A shot fired across the bow of fruit roll ups.

635
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We're just rolling out sponsors left and right huh?

636
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Basically you just go to naturebox.com and you check out their huge snack catalog.

643
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I would like to talk to everybody about their underpinnings.

644
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's underwear.

645
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What's on your frame?

646
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Really informs.

647
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
No it's not a question.

648
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's the rest of the sentence.

649
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Really informs I would say the rest of your day.

650
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You know what I mean?

651
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't know if you're like me but you wake up in the morning and you kind of look through your walk in closet of underwear.

652
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And you decide what kind of day you're going to have.

653
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Are you going to wear your favorite pair?

654
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Are you going to wear your least favorite pair?

655
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Are you going to wear your productive underpants?

656
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Are you going to wear your comfortable underpants?

657
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Are you going to wear your chain mail underpants?

658
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Are you going to wear your lead lined underpants?

659
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You really have to decide.

660
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's laundry day so I'm wearing some non-mundies.

661
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And it's a pair of boxers that are like a size too big for me.

662
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And to quote the classic song Huge Basketball Shorts, it's like a Bedouin group tent cinched by a belt.

663
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's no good down there.

664
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And it's ruining this podcast.

665
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So we would like you to really get your undercarriage game on point.

666
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Much like Justin might modify the undercarriage of his new whip, you can modify your undercarriage with me undies.

667
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And you know what?

668
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Here's the super fun.

669
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And you know, it's a little bit cheesy but I think it's nice that you can do matching underpants for you and your partner.

670
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Or partners.

671
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You know what I mean?

672
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Go to town.

673
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Matching the undercarriage of me undies.

674
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

675
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
For your business partners.

676
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
For your business partners?

677
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
For your band partners?

678
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That might be the thing that brings you up.

679
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Maybe you're like, you know how the Red Hot Chili Peppers always perform with their dicks out?

680
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh yeah, I love that.

681
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Because that's what I want to see is a bunch of like 50 year old dudes hanging brain at the Super Bowl.

682
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Right?

683
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Thanks Chili Peps.

684
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So maybe your band thing is you all playing matching me undies.

685
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Right?

686
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Now I know what you're thinking.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But Travis, I am in the polyphonic spree and that would cost way too much.

688
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay.

689
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well first of all, thank you for listening.

690
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000

So you have nothing to lose.

697
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think that's a bold claim, but I'm not making it.

698
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Me undies is making it.

You're going to turn it all around.

706
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I guarantee 2017 is the year that if you haven't girded your loins with me undies,

707
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
you're just not doing it right.

708
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Meundies.com slash my brother.

709
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I have a message here for Jacqueline and it's from Misty who says,

710
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Happy birthday to my favorite older sister.

711
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You did a great job this past year and I'm sure this next year will be even better.

712
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You're still an awesome sister even if you're seeing Hamilton three times and only taking me once.

713
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You did introduce me to the brothers so I guess it's a fair trade.

714
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Happy birthday again from your sweet baby sister.

715
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And wow, that one's for January 13th.

716
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We did a good job with the timing on that.

717
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yay.

718
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Good job.

719
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I love – you got to see Hamilton three times because that's when you really start to notice the ARG.

720
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah.

721
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Lynn is hitting – happy birthday Lynn by the way.

722
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Happy birthday Lynn.

723
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Happy birthday Lynn.

724
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Happy birthday.

725
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Have so many secret messages though and so many like a secret game and like a fun riddle.

726
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And there's like call outs that they want you to do.

727
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah.

728
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Like you can actually – a lot of people don't know this but if you watch Hamilton and do the call outs at the right time,

729
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you actually shift the story.

730
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They're like, oh we have a puzzle keeper in the audience.

731
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
There's like an old wizard that is not normally by the show but he comes out and he's like, we have a puzzle keeper.

732
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And then the rest of the show just becomes about you trying to solve the – it's still very good.

733
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's still good.

734
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The first time you just watch the show.

735
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The second time you look for the clues.

736
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The third time, the trick is you got to watch the audience to find out who the murderer is.

737
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Find out who the murderer is.

738
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But then if you find out the right keyword, at the end of the show, Bird's got his gun pointed at Hamilton.

739
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Hamilton points his pistol at this guy.

740
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And then you shout, we the people because that's the key code.

741
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Hamilton points his gun down, shoots Aaron Bird to death.

742
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And Hamilton lives.

743
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And Hamilton wins.

744
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But then you get this good ending.

745
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Nobody's gotten the good ending yet.

746
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You've only gotten the bad ending.

747
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And also here's a little secret that they don't tell you when you buy your ticket.

748
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Reach under your chair.

749
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
There's a little keypad in there and you can vote on which ending you want to see.

750
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

751
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Look under your chair.

752
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You also get to vote on –

753
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
No farther. Reach farther.

754
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Farther.

755
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You get to vote on which family submission video is the funniest American home video.

756
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That's what they don't tell you.

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
They don't tell you that.

758
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
A lot of secret stuff.

759
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I have another message.

760
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh no.

761
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You can do it.

762
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Can I?

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Do you mind?

764
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This message is for Sarah and Ty.

765
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's from Dad.

766
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's from Mom.

767
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's from Rachel.

768
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's from Elliot.

769
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It's from Tim.

770
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And it's from Elizabeth.

771
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Congratulations on your wedding.

772
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We hope your new life together is full of love, joy, and puppies.

773
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Now let the brothers three –

774
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Say it.

775
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Weltern?

776
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Weltum?

777
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Weltum?

778
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Weltum you to married life with our theme song.

779
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We are the Coulter family and we are hospitable in every single little way possible.

780
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We've got fire hazards in every room.

781
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Just make sure you're not here when it goes boom, tick, tick, boom, boom, boom.

782
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's the theme song.

783
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's a good theme song.

784
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Thanks.

785
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
No, it's not.

786
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm not congratulating you.

787
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm congratulating this family.

788
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can write it.

789
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
There is a lot of notation here.

790
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's fully orchestrated and stuff.

791
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah.

792
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Congratulations, Sarah and Ty, rest of the family.

793
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Get the fuck together.

794
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Fire is serious business, y'all.

795
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Don't make us call somebody – like have a building inspector come in and shut you down.

796
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll call the fire police, the cop who's also a fireman.

797
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
He's the most powerful.

798
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
He's the most powerful because he has jurisdiction over both – over legal law and fire law,

799
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
so you better watch out and you better not cry.

800
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
They let him use an ax and a gun.

801
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
He's got an ax and a gun, so you better watch out.

802
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Better say your prayers.

803
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
When I was a kid, I used to see the fire inspector come by and I thought his job was to tell

804
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
if it was a fire or not.

805
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, this was done by a fire.

806
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This one was a fire, guys.

807
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Back it up.

808
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hi, brothers.

809
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
My boyfriend today did this joke kiss thing where he leaned in with his mouth wide open

810
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
to put his mouth over the top of my mouth and also my nose.

811
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh my god.

812
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Instinctually, I tapped him pretty hard in the balls.

813
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I do not feel the punishment fits the crime and I'm wondering what kind of gift I should

814
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
get that says I'm sorry for balls tapping you.

815
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Any suggestions?

816
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Thanks.

817
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And that's from Sorry About Your Sandbags in Seattle.

818
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's a funny thing about the ball tap.

819
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah.

820
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because if you don't have balls, when you see people get kicked in the nards, like Wolfman

821
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
or whoever, get kicked in the nards, a lot of times you think, oh, that must be the most

822
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
painful thing.

823
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's actually the tap is worse.

824
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The tap is worse.

825
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The worst ball pain, I think, is when you're wrapping up in an extension cord and you're

826
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
not taking great care.

827
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And you're not wearing pants.

828
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I hear a laugh of recognition.

829
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Everybody who has balls goes through this one, I think, sometimes.

830
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You wrap it up in an extension cord and it just gives that tap.

831
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's nausea.

832
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's rough.

833
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's really rough.

834
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I was laughing because it would be funny if we just talked about different ways you could

835
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
get hit in your gyms for the next 20 minutes.

836
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Maybe a bee lands on your crotch and someone's trying to be helpful.

837
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You get hit with a newspaper.

838
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's very good.

839
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about nut shots because that ain't us.

840
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That just ain't us.

841
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I like to think we're a little bit better than this Ashton Kutcher form of humor.

842
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And we got at least 20 more episodes.

843
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We got to stretch it out a little bit.

844
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
We got to stretch it out.

845
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We don't want to burn it out.

846
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Stretching it out is another painful way.

847
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But I do want to say that I do actually think the punishment fit the crime because they

848
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
tried to do baby CPR on you and that is unacceptable.

849
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That's actually I think how the dementor's kiss works.

850
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes.

851
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You've got to be careful with that shit.

852
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You might have saved your life.

853
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You don't know.

854
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Maybe this whole boyfriend thing has just been a long con to eat your soul to commit you.

855
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I took a baby CPR class and you just put your whole mouth over basically their entire face

856
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and it's like, ugh, really?

857
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Kiddo, I wouldn't like that basically at all.

858
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And I know it's a life-saving procedure but ugh, boy, their whole face.

859
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, the whole head basically just popping in your mouth like a jawbreaker and you breathe

860
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
real hard.

861
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Shit, that seems like it would stink but alright.

862
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I can't imagine having that be done to me as a person.

863
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
No thank you.

864
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I think you're on solid ground here.

865
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah, no one should do that.

866
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
He shouldn't have done that to you.

867
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And I mean like, he'll remember.

868
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah.

869
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
He's not going to try it again.

870
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Absolutely not.

871
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
The three of you enter a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a hoard of precious

872
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
golden rubies.

873
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And he says, what do you do adventures?

874
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm a dragon man.

875
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I cast fire on him.

876
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's very good.

877
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I address the red dragon and say, us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

878
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

879
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Very good synergy.

880
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Commit to the bit.

881
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I roll to charm new listeners.

882
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It is very effective against all odds.

883
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Everybody, we're the Macroids, we host the Adventure Zone, it's a podcast where we play

884
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Dungeons and Dragons together.

885
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's a comedy podcast.

886
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take

887
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the time to learn them.

888
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Maybe listen to us.

889
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

890
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

891
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I think this promo's a critical hit.

892
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I have a Yahoo real quick here I could do.

893
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Okay.

894
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's from Altaba Answers user Drew Davenport.

895
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's from Altaba's own Drew Davenport.

896
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's his new name, Altaba's Own.

897
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's from Altaba user Hominy Dominy who asks, do you know some movie, cartoon, or book with

898
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
same style of monkey bone?

899
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Maybe the nearest it that I know be The Mask or movies of Tim Burton and yet it's not exactly

900
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
that I quest.

901
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Okay.

902
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You know how sometimes those like fake news stories pop up at the bottom of other news

903
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
stories and they say like, why no one will ever cast such and such in a movie again?

904
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I often see that for Brendan Fraser and I'm like, oh, I know why.

905
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh no, I've got it.

906
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I like Brendan Fraser.

907
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I do too.

908
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I love Brendan Fraser.

909
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But that's fool.

910
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Listen, we've talked about the nine lives of Brendan Fraser's career many times before,

911
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
but like he in like one year made like the remake of Bedazzled, Monkeybone, and like

912
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
six other movies.

913
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Can we just talk quick pivot?

914
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I was listening to a recent Rosebuddies where your wife Rachel said she's never seen a

915
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Brendan Fraser film.

916
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah.

917
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
What?

918
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What?

919
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Pretty wild.

920
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I didn't accidentally see a Brendan Fraser movie.

921
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think she's, I think sometimes on that show she just like, she says stuff to sound more

922
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
erudite than I am.

923
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Sure.

924
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But you know she's seen George of the Jungle and loved it.

925
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
She saw George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle too and loved both of them, even

926
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
though I don't think Brendan's in the second one.

927
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
She's just so hungry for that Fraser content.

928
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
One time she watched, oh, this is great.

929
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We were scrolling through Netflix and she's like, what's this show?

930
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And I was like, Fraser?

931
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And she was like, yeah, let's watch it.

932
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And she was like, where's Brendan the whole time?

933
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And I was like, he's not in this one.

934
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
He's not in that one.

935
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's Kelsey in this one.

936
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
How do you not at least see Encino Man?

937
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I mean-

938
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, we can't.

939
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Weaves in the Juice?

940
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I know.

941
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

942
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Love Brendan Fraser.

943
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
What the fuck were we talking about?

944
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Monkeybone, is there a show, it's like a recommendation.

945
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We can do like a Netflix recommendation, how you watch one documentary on how grains are

946
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
harvested in Turkey or something like that and it's like, oh, here's a hundred more grain

947
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
movies.

948
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Oh, I've got it.

949
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I don't know.

950
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I've got it, Griffin.

951
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I've got it.

952
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I've got it.

953
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You like Monkeybone.

954
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I love Monkeybone.

955
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I love Monkeybone.

956
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Must love Monkeybone.

957
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Then you might like Cool World.

958
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Cool World is very Monkeybone.

959
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Oh, man.

960
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Cool World on the SNES, love that.

961
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
You control Jack, the character from Cool World and you're just like doing it.

962
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Was Brad Pitt in Cool World?

963
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah, he was.

964
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Brad Pitt was Cool World.

965
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah, he was Cool World.

966
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Whoa.

967
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I loved the Monkeybone game on the JNES and that console only had four games on it and

968
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:23,180
it was Monkeybone, it was Gremlins 3, it was Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

969
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,760
So they did make one, they released one more late game.

970
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,120
I believe that was the Streetball version.

971
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,200
Can everybody just give me 45 seconds?

972
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,860
Cool World for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System has a Wikipedia page.

973
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,600
The Wikipedia page will fill a single browser window, it is not extensive.

974
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,660
The largest section is gameplay, it is broken into two paragraphs.

975
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,600
Here is the full text of that section.

976
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,980
The player controls Jack, who must avoid being surrounded by the pauper police, a cartoon

977
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,400
police force, or get arrested.

978
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,480
Depending on how many times the player has broken the law and whether he has collected

979
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,600
the in-game currency of nickels, that's italicized, or not, the player will either get a lecture

980
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,440
by Detective Frank Harris and or be forced to pay bail money.

981
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,720
Ten coins is the usual bail required by Detective Harris.

982
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,680
Players can visit Las Vegas to increase their nickel stash and store their coins at the

983
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,400
Cool World bank.

984
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,640
Other in-game, that's the first paragraph, other in-game locales include a pawn shop

985
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,040
that allows items to be traded or bought with nickels, in addition to the stash slash club

986
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,240
where the player arranges a date with Holly Wood.

987
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,400
At Holly Wood's house, the player must navigate the exterior of the house in order to reach

988
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,660
the date with Holly.

989
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,880
If the player did not arrange a date with Holly before reaching the top, Jack is tossed

990
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,320
back to the ground level.

991
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,040
In the malt shop, candy can be found, in addition to other sweets.

992
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,080
However, entry is restricted to players who have collected several pieces of candy.

993
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
End of gameplay description.

994
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
That's a good one.

995
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Gotta watch out.

996
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,720
Gotta get my hands on this card.

997
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,640
Now Nintendo Power did give that bad boy 3.25 out of 5.

998
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,720
Power Unlimited went with 75% rating in their July 1993 issue.

999
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,240
You know, three quarters of it's pretty good.

1000
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,840
There's a- I didn't like the malt level with the candy, but other than that-

1001
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,080
I love the pawn shop though, and the very graphic sex scene with Holly Wood.

1002
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,800
The graphics in the pawn shop and the sex scene were- the graphics were amazing.

1003
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:27,720
This is three fourths of the way to the greatest game you could possibly make, basically.

1004
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,200
I look at- I look at this, I look at Link to the Past and I say like, this is only 25%

1005
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
worse than this.

1006
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,240
Cool world, man.

1007
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,240
What a trip.

1008
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,440
That's a good recommendation for this.

1009
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,320
Didn't get Brad Pitt on the box though.

1010
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,800
Did not get Brad Pitt- there's a- there's a cartoon Kim Basinger, but not Brad Pitt.

1011
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
Didn't get the license.

1012
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,200
That's probably one of those Tom Cruise situations where like, he won't allow his spirit to be

1013
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,440
sucked up in a video game cartridge.

1014
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,780
I have a recommendation.

1015
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,160
If you like Monkeybone, you will love Seabiscuit.

1016
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,560
Now why is that?

1017
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Okay.

1018
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:17,820
Well, Chris Kattan is in it, and he plays- he plays Monkeybone, and he's a rival jockey,

1019
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,660
but he's like, up to no good.

1020
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,200
So it's an unofficial non-canonical sequel?

1021
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,560
Is that what you're saying?

1022
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,760
It's canon- it is canonical.

1023
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,280
Seabiscuit's in the Boneverse, baby, and a lot of movies are and you don't realize it.

1024
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,320
Hamilton's technically in the Monkeyboneverse.

1025
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,280
Just nobody knows it because it's in the good ending.

1026
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,280
Here's a question.

1027
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,720
I have a problem where I can't throw away any stuffed animals or put them in my closet

1028
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,600
because I don't want to hurt their feelings.

1029
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,040
Fuck you, Toy Story.

1030
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,000
The real issue is that whenever people come over, they see my stuffed animals, assume

1031
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,640
I collect them, and then get me more as gifts.

1032
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,080
Ooh, that's rough.

1033
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,200
It's nice of them, but I am 20 years old, and I have about 50 stuffed animals now, and

1034
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,920
I'm running out of room on my bed.

1035
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,840
How do you politely tell people to stop getting me stuffed animals?

1036
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,400
That's from Entombed in East Lansing.

1037
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,960
You don't see that part of Toy Story, where Andy's just like crushed by the emotional

1038
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,480
weight of having all these toys, and his mom's like, look, I got you a new year, it's Dash

1039
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,480
Rendar.

1040
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:22,640
He's like, fucking another toy that I can't, ugh, hello Dash, hi, I'm Dash Rendar, point

1041
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,960
me which way to Boba Femme, kick his ass, okay, well, Dave, don't let me die or get

1042
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,960
rid of me.

1043
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,120
Okay, god, it's like I have 40 kids, this sucks, I hate my toys.

1044
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,800
I'm a Star Wars character without any superpowers or laser swords, I'm everybody's favorite.

1045
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,880
I don't have a cool motorcycle thing.

1046
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,960
I'm nothing.

1047
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,320
If you carry me out on the street and let me go and I fall into a drain, it's like you've

1048
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,840
murdered a real person.

1049
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
All right, Dash, fuck.

1050
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,280
Do you just want to stay in my room, I guess?

1051
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,080
Yeah, but don't let the cat get me, it'll actually kill me like it's killed a real person.

1052
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,680
The problem is, if you get rid of some of your stuffed animals, people will come by

1053
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,760
and say, mm, supplies look a little low.

1054
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,160
Let me run through them real quick.

1055
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,400
Let me top you off with a few more stuffed animals.

1056
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,640
This is Susan the rabbit and she has to take these pills twice a day.

1057
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,760
Okay, just more responsibility.

1058
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,360
You don't need all this responsibility on your shoulders at 20 years old.

1059
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:28,000
I think you need to divest, or maybe come up with a fictional sort of plague that sweeps

1060
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,760
through, you know what I mean?

1061
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,160
That's a dark way to take it, but if you're worried about offending the spirits or whatever

1062
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:41,760
of these stuffed animals, maybe some of them, I don't know, died and then you can get rid

1063
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
of them.

1064
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,360
I know that's a dark way to take this, but it solves the problem pretty well.

1065
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,840
Well, there's a lighter way to go with this and the answer is in the question.

1066
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:59,440
You're stuck in Toy Story 1, you gotta get to Toy Story 3 and give these to a child who

1067
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,960
will appreciate having 100 stuffed animals all over their bed, you know what I mean?

1068
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,360
It's their problem now.

1069
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,840
You need to put away such childish things and start a new journey for, you know, Mr.

1070
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,160
Bear McGuggins and give them to a neighborhood child.

1071
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,600
Don't do a Toy Story 2 though and give one of them to a weird pervert because then you

1072
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,800
actually end up with more toys at the end of the movie.

1073
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,080
It's a net toy gain.

1074
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,040
I suggest, you know people do Christmas cards.

1075
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,440
I would like to suggest a new kind of card that you can send out to everybody.

1076
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,160
People use Christmas cards to update people with their life scenario or whatever.

1077
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,880
I want to suggest a new kind of card called I'm out the game cards and basically here's

1078
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
what this would be.

1079
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,960
It would be a picture of you with all your stuffed animals and at the top it would say

1080
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,840
in huge letters, I'm out the game and on the inside it would say, see all these motherfuckers?

1081
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,300
They're headed to the dumpster.

1082
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,220
This chapter of my life is over and everybody needs to be made aware of that, but you don't,

1083
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,960
you don't do anything.

1084
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,320
You don't get rid of them.

1085
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,880
You keep them and if people come by just be like, yeah I haven't made it to the dumpster

1086
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,720
yet but soon I'm gonna get there.

1087
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,840
But then everybody will know that you're out of the game and they won't get you any more

1088
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,200
stuffed animals and you can do this with anything.

1089
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,760
Any hobby that you're over, like if nine-year-old Griffin could have said to everybody, I'm

1090
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,200
out the game regarding NASCAR, which he had a brief flirtation with, the reverberations

1091
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
echoed.

1092
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,760
I teased with it.

1093
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,720
And you didn't quite, didn't quite shake it for a while.

1094
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,380
I got a NASCAR, I got a fucking NASCAR like fat head that I had hung up on the wall of

1095
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:45,720
my room for like a minute and I was like, what am I doing?

1096
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
This isn't me.

1097
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,680
But he knew he was out the game but other people didn't know that he was out of the

1098
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
game.

1099
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,600
So I'm saying we need to make it a custom that you make, you make a broad sweeping announcement

1100
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,880
that everybody should be aware that you're out of a particular game, that you're no longer

1101
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,880
in the game.

1102
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,760
Uh, but then like what if they've already bought me, you know, the Joey Logano fat head

1103
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,600
to hang up alongside the, the, the DJ 3 fat head.

1104
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
You throw it in the trash.

1105
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
DJ?

1106
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Who's DJ?

1107
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,340
Cause it's, it would definitely be DE would be Dale Earnhardt and he's definitely junior,

1108
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
not the third.

1109
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,040
So I kind of, I, I, man, ha ha, racing, right?

1110
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,160
Like there's so many racers it's hard to keep them all straight.

1111
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,360
I think it's racist.

1112
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:33,800
If you're following toys, if you're following toy story rules, um, then if you have your

1113
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,520
stuffed animals somewhere where you can see them easily that you're robbing life seconds

1114
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,760
from them, honestly, because they can't live their lives as long as you can see them.

1115
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,780
So the kindest thing you could do for them is put them in an attic where they can build

1116
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,920
a new society free from your tyrannical rule and they can live forever up there and they

1117
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,760
never have to shut off their spirits and you can live your life downstairs and everybody

1118
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,600
can just go back to business.

1119
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
That's what I would do.

1120
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,720
That's the toy floor.

1121
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
We don't go up there.

1122
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,720
They have their life.

1123
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
We have ours.

1124
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,200
If we go up there, we kill them.

1125
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
So we have to stay here.

1126
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,200
When you see them, they're dead.

1127
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:15,880
So you would think there would be one scene in toy story of like a toy, like sneezing

1128
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,840
and everybody being like, what, right?

1129
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,600
Like the toy sneezes when it's in dead mode.

1130
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,880
Yeah, because they're just pretending to be toys.

1131
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,880
Yeah.

1132
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,880
Yeah.

1133
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,880
I mean, definitely.

1134
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,960
What's the toy movie that's sort of like the Christmas toy?

1135
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
Christmas, right.

1136
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,960
You guys read that one?

1137
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
Yeah.

1138
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,680
That's kind of like it follows toy story law sort of, but if you get spotted, you're dead.

1139
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
Yeah.

1140
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,680
That's cool.

1141
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,680
But you're still a toy.

1142
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,680
That's the thing.

1143
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,240
Just your anima, your soul is ripped from your toy body and you are then, and the worst

1144
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,440
part about that is, is like, and not to jump into the old internet, you know, toy story.

1145
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,440
What if they die?

1146
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,160
But like, then that toy's still there.

1147
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,840
It's not like the human picks up and goes, nah, soul's out of it, better get rid of this

1148
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,840
one.

1149
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,840
This one's got a soul.

1150
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,880
Got a soul dumpster.

1151
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,200
So this has been my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

1152
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,360
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1153
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,080
Sorry about killing all those toys at the end.

1154
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,980
I think it's got a little dark.

1155
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,680
And sorry about what else, the Ronald sex thing was like out of line.

1156
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,120
Really sorry about that.

1157
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,720
Even bringing that awful Brendan Fraser movie to my like attention, you manifested it into

1158
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,600
my universe and I don't know if I can forgive you for that.

1159
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,600
That's a nightmare.

1160
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,160
That maybe should be wiped from existence.

1161
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,900
So sorry about all that stuff, but we hope you've managed to enjoy yourself somehow against

1162
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,900
all odds.

1163
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,160
Is there anything cooking that we want to tell people about, anything in the hopper?

1164
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:50,000
I would like to do a little plug for a new project that I am starting this week.

1165
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,760
So me and Hal Lublin, who is, you know, another host of General Podcasts and a good friend

1166
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,320
of mine, we're starting a podcast called Surprisingly Nice, where we sit down with

1167
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:08,320
people that we are both friends and fans of and just have a super pleasant conversation.

1168
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,240
We just recorded our first episode with Adam Savage and topics of discussion included,

1169
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,260
what's your favorite kind of weather and why?

1170
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,640
What's your favorite smell that you would never find as a Yankee Candle?

1171
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,320
When you have ice cream, do you eat it right away or let it melt a little?

1172
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,000
And it's very nice.

1173
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:35,600
And the kind of hook of it is each episode, there will be a 45 minute version made available

1174
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:42,840
for free to everybody, and there will also be an extended version on Bandcamp for a dollar.

1175
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:48,240
And all money from those sales goes to a charity of the guests choosing.

1176
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,600
So in episode one, Adam Savage chose the Standing Rock Tribe.

1177
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,400
So all money from the sale of those episodes will go to Standing Rock.

1178
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,440
So if you want to check that out, all the free episodes will be on iTunes and we'll

1179
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,680
also tweet out the link.

1180
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,240
The Twitter is The Nice Cast.

1181
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:14,560
And you can also find the extended versions on Bandcamp at bit.ly forward slash surprisingly

1182
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,560
nice.

1183
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,600
Our monikers expansion came out.

1184
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:23,540
And so if you bought one of those, then you should have it or have it very soon.

1185
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,800
If you didn't, I don't think there's, is there going to be a way to get it after this?

1186
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:34,400
I think we warned people fairly well that it was a one time dealie.

1187
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,160
So yeah, I hope you all enjoy it.

1188
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,880
I'm really happy with how it turned out.

1189
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:45,280
It's cool that we have like a card game thing that like has all our dumb jokes on it.

1190
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,000
And thank you to the monikers folks for doing that with us.

1191
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,760
It was a lot of fun.

1192
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,240
Our CISO show is coming out soon, in like a month, and that's going to be really good

1193
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,240
too.

1194
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,760
There's going to be more stuff about it coming out soon, more video stuff that I think y'all

1195
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,760
are going to like.

1196
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use of Our Theme Song Instead of Parture

1197
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,040
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1198
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,640
It's a very, very, very good album to listen to during this long winter.

1199
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,160
Also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us.

1200
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,280

1201
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,720

Uh, well folks, that's it.

1207

Yeah, so I have a final yahoo here and it's sent in by, wow, what's wrong?

1208
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,680
Yeah.

1209
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,360
It's just like Justin suddenly forgot how he ended every episode of the show.

1210
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,360
Yeah.

1211
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,360
Sorry, I'm still getting over this call.

1212
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
I don't feel great.

1213
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
I'm just trying my best.

1214
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,360
Don't say that you didn't like this episode because I was trying my best.

1215
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,680
Who's trying his best, everybody?

1216
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,400
I'm trying my best, believe it or not.

1217
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,400
This one was sent in by, man, a lot of people sent in some really good ones this week, but

1218
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,880
this closer was sent in by Level 9000 Altaba user Drew Davenport.

1219
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,200
Sorry, is that the hat trick?

1220
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,200
Yeah.

1221
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Damn.

1222
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,920
Thank you, Drew.

1223
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:26,320
It's from Altaba answers user Brian who asks, what hookah tobacco smells like sex or a sexy

1224
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
