1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on the wall, I have seen it.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What's up, you cool kids?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you, my dear wizard.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As excited as you all are to see us, I promise we're twice as excited to see these beers.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I forgot the paper Yacht is backstage, is that going to be a problem?

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh no!

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So ruined.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like Chilean Meyers emerging.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not going to kill it.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is my brother, I'm going to make you a show from the Bajoran era.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I'm your sweet, pain-y man, Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Can I get a shout?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can I get a shout for the Dog Pound?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's up, Dog Pound?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I know what you're thinking, oh no, we got shitty seats.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You actually got great seats.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're not going to look at you the whole shit over.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But every once in a while, I'll indicate to you or acknowledge that you were there.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to expect something back.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A lot of love, as they say.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, audience one, I don't know.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Audience one, I want you to know, I want to say a lot of thanks to the Dog Pound.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're still number one in my heart.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't forget about that.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That Justin, you can't trust that guy.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You and me, we got something special going on.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Dog Pound, you know what I mean.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dog Pound, yeah!

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How are you?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is show number four for you.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, yeah, I crossed the river going, I'm halfway there.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You know, it is so weird seeing what it would be like to have an actual job.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've done something.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, because doing comedy podcasts.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, sitting down and jerking off for two hours.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, man.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't imagine the jerking off for two hours.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It would be really exhausting.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Unproductive.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Should we, I guess we should.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And do like what we do with the show, like questions and stuff.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, I thought we might explain that we're going to take live questions probably.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We're going to run out of stuff to talk about.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So start thinking of things you might want to ask us up here.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Not about poopy.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Not about poop.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Not about sleeping with your best friend's girlfriend.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not about asking for gas money.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Cover.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Otherwise, it's a fair game.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Have fun.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Get crazy.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Get it right, because if not, you will be mocked.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It will be bad.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You will feel bad about yourself.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You won't feel like all those rippers.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They were ribbing me.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You'll feel mocked.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And if you guys want any of the snacks on the table,

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
feel free to just come up and grab them, because the last show brought us trinkets.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can't complain we got beers.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But somebody brought like a whole thing of cheer wine from Florida that they shipped here,

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
which is great.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I know.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the best marriage.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Start.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Jump in.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Begin.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just finished my shows to each degree.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It said there to hold for applause.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are these people that are here?

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is Steve.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't say, is Steve here?

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because I was afraid.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Steve, what's up, Steve?

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry I made an art sound about your degree.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I'll be moving into an apartment closer to my new school this summer.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The problem is, I don't have any life skills.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't cook.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know how to iron clothes.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And paying bills is a totally foreign concept to me.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Basically, I need whatever wisdom you three have on being an adult.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Steve, I want to know something, Steve.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've got a real question for you, okay?

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
After you decided to sit in the front row, was there a moment when you were like, oh,

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
man, I've got a question.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't know shit about shit.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to have to sit before a council of my elders and admit my failings five feet

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
away.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why isn't there like a website that's just like, when you graduate college, you get a

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
membership.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And it's like, here's how you pay a bill.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Here's how you do another thing.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because that's supposed to be everything leading up to that moment.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's fucking not, though.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I learned all about how to measure the volume of shapes or whatever.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But they don't teach you how to register to vote ever.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ever.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Not once.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I learned what voting does.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I learned all about what a bill is, but I don't know how I participate in that conversation.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We had a life skills class where we had to create a budget, learn how to fill out a check,

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
which was a lot of fun.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We had to pick real estate from the book.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We went to the same fucking school, right?

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We had a budget we had to live off of.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you had to pick real estate, and you had to make a food list of things you're going

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to buy for your family.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Fruit roll ups, fruit roll ups, fruit roll ups.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And everybody in my class was picking real estate out of the book that cost like $200,000,

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
$300,000.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Bolin!

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
These are some Bolin heists.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, they're Bolins.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And even at my young age, maybe this is when I decided to deviate from the pack, I'm a

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
young age, and I was like, you dumb motherfuckers, you don't really live there.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I bought the dandy duplex, it was called, and it cost me $20,000 imaginary dollars.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I didn't spend one goddamn day there because I was 11.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'm looking around at my fellow students like, we're 11.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know they won't make you move into this fake house you bought with your imaginary

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
money, save it for the little debbies that you're not going to borrow with your imaginary

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
money.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I did.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I budgeted a lot of little debbies.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
People made fun of me for it.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I guess because maybe I got a reputation because I brought those in my lunch every day.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We got off-brand little debbies.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
When I took that one, I remember playing that game.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Give it up for Star Crunches, everybody.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I remember playing that game in high school, and what happened to me was I got approved

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
for a loan for like the $200,000 house, and instead I got a $75,000 house and used the

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
rest to buy imaginary beds because I thought it was just free money.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And then the teacher explained to me that I'd have to pay that back, and I had to petition

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the class to let me return the 150 animals I bought.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And as you can imagine, they were not forgiving.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You might have had it all wrong.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You may not have had a revenue stream, but you had a zoo.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because I had a hundred of these stray dogs.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The worst fucking zoo ever.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It sounds like we all sort of subscribe to the blank Czech school of economics.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, what a bouncy castle.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm putting a water slide in my house.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you have any idea how much it costs to upkeep a bouncy castle?

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, I don't.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Steve, learn to cook five things.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because by the fifth day, you'll be ready to eat the first thing again.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So anybody who knows how to cook more than five things is just showing off.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm at the point in my life where Tuesday is tostada night, and I gained a lot of security

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
from that.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's not as scary as I thought it would be when I was younger.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, it gives me a lot of comfort.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
At least there's tostadas.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At least I have something to look forward to.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We'll always have tostadas.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
At least I have something to look forward to.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I mean, yes.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
One brief shining moment, and it's black and white.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I just can't put up with the new Tuesdays are coming.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah, sweet tostada Tuesday.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If I can just hold out until tostadas.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The light shines in my dark prison cell life for 15 minutes a day.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But Tuesdays are coming.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am getting a somewhat dirty look from Saltwater's co-host, Cindy Mackerel.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I do want to acknowledge that, yes, I do understand you're seven months pregnant.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I am definitely looking forward to that in addition to tostada night.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Basically even though.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ladies, the tostadas.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
These go back and forth.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How can you ask them to choose?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can actually learn to cook really easy by buying a slow cooker.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You put anything.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Put a bunch of shit in it.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Just put a bunch of shit in it.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then make rice.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And put the shit from the pot onto the rice.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Dinner is done.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's figured.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's how I make my tostadas.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Listen, everybody I'm going to let you in on both tostadas.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
See your dog pound.

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know what's up.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You put.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You get chicken.

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hold on.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So I need a pen.

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll tell you what happens.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Chicken dinners.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Put them in a slow cooker.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A little cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic.

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then you dump a jar of salsa on top of it.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
On high for two hours in a slow cooker.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are going to have tostadas.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So Steve, I hope that answers your question about how to make tostadas.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How do I make tostadas?

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Are you going to make one?

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Perfect.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We did great.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Good job.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Ten out of ten.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Are there white cables?

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So what else do you need help with?

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Cooking is covered.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Cooking is covered.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How to iron.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Take a hot thing and smooth it out.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But don't do it wrong or else it will fuck it up forever.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You just got to keep moving.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't wait.

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, ruined.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Steve, life hack.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't iron anything.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hang it up in the shower.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Turn the shower on full blast.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Close the bathroom door.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Twenty minutes later everything is steaming clean.

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Doesn't actually work.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know what's up.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You can also just throw it in the dryer with a damp washcloth.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It does the same thing.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So you forgot to empty the dryer so now everything is wrinkled?

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No it's not.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Put a wet towel in there for ten minutes.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oops.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's all fixed.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This has been Steve's Life Hacks on Steam.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Because it's all this great podcast, they turn my life around and now I'm hacking your

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
life because they helped me so much pay it forward.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you doing okay by the way?

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
In the last record setch I revealed to Justin how I'm going to pay it forward in and he

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:11:06,240
said he was going to be sad for the rest of the day and I was worried about his podcast

238
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:29,240
because I was going to be sad for the rest of the day and he said he was going to be

239
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,240
sad for the rest of the day and I was worried about his podcast because I was worried about

240
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:48,840
his podcast because I was worried about his podcast because I was worried about his podcast

241
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Edward Snowden's super hot.

242
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I just wanna say, wouldn't it have been mind-blowing if Edward Snowden had walked around this whole time?

243
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,840
And that's what he sounds like, he was actually on our show, he's dangerous, I don't know.

244
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
I am Edward Snowden.

245
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Oh, you're Edward Snowden.

246
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I heard I had a...secret admirer.

247
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't tell.

248
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I want to contact him for acquaintances.

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Never mind, I already know who they are.

250
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I found their secrets in the internet.

251
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
What?

252
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I found their secrets in the internet.

253
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I found their secrets in the internet.

254
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Sorry, I had a frog in my throat.

255
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I love that Edward Snowden and Amelie were introduced so well.

256
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,840
We've been like one episode of each other and now they've fused into this.

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
We're very different.

258
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I understand you, Snowden.

259
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Sure.

260
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Copyright, copyright.

261
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Sorry, that's my bad.

262
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,840
That guy looks more like a Hollywood actor than a CIA agent.

263
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Never mind.

264
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
He likes to have hearty shmuttering.

265
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I don't even care what he does or say.

266
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,840
I just want to tie him up and do many things to him.

267
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,840
That's not an okay thing to say about anyone.

268
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Personally...

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I just want to tie him up and do stuff to him.

270
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I think if you want to tie me up, you're more fair.

271
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Well, the U.S. government has failed and no one can tie Snowden.

272
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I know the secret way to untie every knot.

273
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Hold on, hold on.

274
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
They cannot tie me.

275
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Does Snowden know all secrets?

276
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I know all secrets.

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Ask me anything.

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Tell me about the secret McDonald's video.

279
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
That is in the previous episode.

280
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Continuity.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
That's the continuity for people at home.

282
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Nobody in the theater that we're performing for right now.

283
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Personally, how do you rate his looks from 0 to 10?

284
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,840
0 seems super fucking harsh to apply to any...

285
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
That's like you don't have any body at all.

286
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
When I look at your face, it's just a gray mass.

287
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
It's just a blob.

288
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm a chevin.

289
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Strong, strong chevin.

290
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
So hush, Snowden journalist.

291
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
You're in the right light with your 7.5.

292
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,840
The few cocktails.

293
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Snowden can't do real.

294
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
He's not an eco maniac.

295
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
You're doing all right over there.

296
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Wherever you are.

297
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
They say it's Russia, but that's a false flag.

298
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
That's a false flag.

299
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm doing fine.

300
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I would like to meet a special someone.

301
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
To keep him busy?

302
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
To let them meet the secrets.

303
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
To enjoy the secrets.

304
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
It must be really hard to...

305
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
I don't know.

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Go on.

307
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,840
It must be hard to find someone that will let you in.

308
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Because once they let you in...

309
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,840
You'll hack fucking everything about them.

310
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Did you see that movie, Little Red Riding Hoodie?

311
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
It was emotional.

312
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Not really.

313
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Are you a vampire?

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,840
I am a vampire of secrets.

315
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
For real.

316
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Right now there's a person in the audience who's looking at the person next to them.

317
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
What the fuck?

318
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Why did you bring me to this, Jeff?

319
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
What is this, Jeff?

320
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
First the thing about the horse dissection and now this guy...

321
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
What is this guy even doing?

322
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
I've seen that cat on television.

323
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
That's not how he sounds.

324
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I really have to pee.

325
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
I can't do that.

326
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
You've got to use this.

327
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Next question.

328
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm a professional writer.

329
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Wait, did we cover it?

330
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
We covered it.

331
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Covered is Snowden Haught?

332
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah, I think we covered it.

333
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm a professional writer.

334
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Over the years I, for the most part, developed a healthy attitude in regards to reviews and criticism.

335
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,840
But last November, a comic mini-series I wrote got a scathing review from a Mr. Clint McElroy.

336
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Why would he...

337
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
And it haunts me still.

338
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Why would he put this in the show?

339
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,840
How do I deal with criticism from your dad?

340
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,840
And that's where Chris Hastings...

341
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Chris, are you here?

342
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Hi, Chris.

343
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah, I don't think so.

344
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Travis is the host.

345
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Travis takes the hostess pose like her dad.

346
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Listen, Chris, if you figure out how to deal with criticism from my dad, I hope you won't let me down.

347
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Can you even get our dad off your job for a second?

348
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Dad's not here yet, right?

349
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
No, en route.

350
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
En route, as they say.

351
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
He was texting a lot of pictures of himself driving, so we'll see if...

352
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You know, who the fuck is he?

353
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,840
What's he done with his life that's so great?

354
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I mean, us.

355
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,840
God, that's a toughie, because normally you'd just be like, fuck that guy.

356
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Or like, whatever.

357
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Or like, live your life.

358
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
He's our dad.

359
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Maybe you should just listen to him.

360
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Maybe it was like, weak.

361
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Not weak, but maybe it had elements that could be polished on down.

362
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Like a bump sign chair.

363
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Like a bumpy chair?

364
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Was your comic like a bumpy chair?

365
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Maybe you should just listen to our dad, whatever he said.

366
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
How odd.

367
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Great points now.

368
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
This is a man who thought Man from Hunkle was a really sweet show.

369
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
You know what you could do?

370
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,840
You could criticize his comic books that he made.

371
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
And really turn the tables on him.

372
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
If you could find the comic adaptation of Freejack...

373
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
He fucking ghost wrote that, you can't say that out loud.

374
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Oh, shit.

375
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
I'll say the comic of Universal Soldier.

376
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
If you find the comic adaptation of Universal Soldier...

377
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Was that also ghost written?

378
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
That was Clint McElroy's drawing.

379
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
We gotta fucking edit...

380
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
None of you can tell...

381
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
We're fucked.

382
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
What else?

383
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
What else can't we tell them about?

384
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Well, he made Green Hornet Dark Tomorrow, which was the alternate universe Green Hornet.

385
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Where Green Hornet was of Asian descent and Kato was white.

386
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
And that was the only choice.

387
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
That was like how he put this script?

388
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
No, that was just one of the things that was in the thing.

389
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
And he did one about vampire hunters?

390
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Blood is the Harvest.

391
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I guarantee you can have some weak shit in Blood is the Harvest.

392
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
The title of it is Blood is the Harvest.

393
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Yes, right there.

394
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
That was not his title.

395
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
It was about two vampire bounty hunters named Deep and Wide.

396
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
And I'm pretty sure he was gonna go with that.

397
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Fuck you guys.

398
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
This is a pretty good comic book.

399
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Who the fuck are you?

400
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Who the fuck are you?

401
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Where's your comic book?

402
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Not you Chris, but the rest of us.

403
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Where's your comics?

404
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Dick shits.

405
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Talk about my dad.

406
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
You're real confrontational.

407
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
You're real excited.

408
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Real excited.

409
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
It's gonna be like Lenny Bruce shit in here.

410
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
The guy seemed angry at me.

411
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Is that Bill Hitz? No, it's me.

412
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
It's all to my dad.

413
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
I'm trying to remember if my dad's ever like genuinely criticized us for shit before.

414
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
No, dad's problem is always he's too supportive.

415
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
So he would say like, yeah, you can be active.

416
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
You're great at football.

417
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Fucking sober not great at football.

418
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
I guarantee.

419
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
You try to stick with wrestling, it's gonna take off.

420
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Didn't ever really see that.

421
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Justin, you good enough at acting that you should spend your college career majoring in acting?

422
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
What's four years?

423
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
This is the craziest thing.

424
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I remember in high school, dad saying it's too bad you gave up on wrestling.

425
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Because now with your Bill, now?

426
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
You'd be so good.

427
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
For half of a second, I would go, hey.

428
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
And I'd go, oh no, wait, right.

429
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I wrestled two years and never won a single match.

430
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
So maybe it's just a no.

431
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Then you wrestle like a sickly boy.

432
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I beat a kid with a flu once.

433
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
But I count that as a tie.

434
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Really?

435
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Did you get the flu afterwards?

436
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
No, I didn't, so I guess I win.

437
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Next question.

438
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
How about you?

439
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Please.

440
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Which one of these are we gonna have?

441
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
That one.

442
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Yeah, do it.

443
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
This one's sent in by Ira Ray.

444
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Are you Ira Ray?

445
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Who wants to know?

446
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Fucking yeah!

447
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
You nailed it.

448
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
You nailed it.

449
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Don Power, I didn't know if you guys did it or not.

450
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
I wasn't looking at you, did you?

451
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Perfect.

452
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
This was sent in by, or was asked by Jane2000.

453
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Who asked?

454
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Min.

455
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Oh, God.

456
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I just bumped a girl as an excuse to touch her.

457
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Awesome, awesome.

458
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Great, great, great, great.

459
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Cool life, cool life you have.

460
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
You can't hug, yet it's too much.

461
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
And shaking hands is too formal.

462
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Is it an excuse to touch a girl?

463
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,840
We're the worst.

464
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
We're the fucking worst.

465
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Just dudes?

466
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Here's the thing, though.

467
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Dude, are there any dudes in here today?

468
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
No, they're all quiet.

469
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I don't know.

470
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
This seems like a trap.

471
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Good instinct, dudes.

472
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
There has to be at least one dude, though, that has like,

473
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Hey, this is my girl.

474
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Never watch this.

475
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

476
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Her knuckles are so soft.

477
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Give me a petri dish.

478
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Fuck, this is just the worst.

479
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
I don't have anything to say about this except it's the worst.

480
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Oh, wait, hold on.

482
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
I mean, so many answers.

483
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
All the time, it gets my heart pounding.

484
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Yahoo Answers, take action against this user immediately.

485
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Where are the moderators?

486
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Just swoop in like Batman.

487
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
No, too creepy.

488
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Get out.

489
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
You've been bounced from Yahoo.

490
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
If you get bounced from Yahoo Answers for being too creepy,

491
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
do you even like move into the woods or something?

492
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Because you may not.

493
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Don't do that.

494
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Fellas.

495
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
How do you sleep at night?

496
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Touching is so overrated, you know?

497
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah, I'd rather just yell at a girl from a car.

498
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
If you have to say...

499
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,840
I'm just trying to make a connection.

500
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
If you ever have to say the words in sequence,

501
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
excuse to touch someone.

502
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
You fucked up somewhere along the way.

503
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah, somewhere by the haywire.

504
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Because they'll know.

505
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh, no.

506
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
You can tell from a fist bump of somebody that wants to touch you,

507
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
it will creep you out through your fists.

508
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
And I guarantee you,

509
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
any woman who has ever had that trick pulled on her

510
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,840
has had this expression on her face.

511
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
To be fair, I feel like that's how anyone should react

512
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
when someone goes, fist bump?

513
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Yeah.

514
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
You want to punch my face?

515
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Because it's not 1971 anymore.

516
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I feel like any fist bump or high five,

517
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I actually extend this to high five,

518
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
where you have to say,

519
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
what is going to happen to me in this?

520
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Hey Pat, let me have this with you.

521
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
No, it's got to be...

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
You will know when it's time to high five,

523
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
and both people will know.

524
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
They will understand that a high five is coming.

525
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
This situation calls for it.

526
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
If you say it aloud, you are forced to say it.

527
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
No question.

528
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
But it could be a courtesy thing,

529
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
because what if you go for a five and they go for a bump?

530
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
You smack them in the face.

531
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
High five.

532
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
And you punch me in the stomach.

533
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
We're not friends anymore.

534
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
But I didn't get to touch you.

535
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
You got to give me that.

536
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Because the other side of that is

537
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
if anyone ever fist bumped and the girl went,

538
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
now I'm in love with this boy.

539
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
I felt that magic spark.

540
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Sorry to interrupt you live Justin.

541
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Great spoofs, us.

542
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
We are nailing it.

543
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
We are...

544
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
This is so funny.

545
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Actually, this was the second one?

546
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Yeah, this was the weakest one.

547
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
No, I thought the next one was the weakest.

548
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
You all got some dog shit to look forward to though.

549
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
No, I'm just kidding.

550
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
They were all decent.

551
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Thank you all for coming to those New York Shorts.

552
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
And thank you to everybody who came out to the LA Life Show.

553
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
We're going to be parsing these out a little bit

554
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
because we got travel plans and we don't want to go...

555
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Babies coming.

556
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Babies coming. We don't want to go a week without an episode.

557
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
So we're spacing these out.

558
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
We'll probably have another regular episode next week.

559
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Sorry about the audio quality on this one.

560
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
I know it's not ideal, but we did our best.

561
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
The LA Life Show should be good though.

562
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Should be so nice.

563
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Let's get paid maybe?

564
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Let's get paid at the Money Zone.

565
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I know you've probably tried Hulu on your computer

566
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
sitting at your desk

567
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
while the boss is looking over your shoulder.

568
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
But it doesn't have to be a secret thing.

569
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Why would the boss be looking...

570
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
If the boss was looking over your shoulder

571
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
at you watching Hulu, he would be very upset.

572
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
The boss is looking over your shoulder

573
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
because he missed South Park.

574
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Okay.

575
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Sounds like a pretty cool boss.

576
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Yeah, he is a cool boss.

577
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
But you don't have to just do that.

578
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
There's something more than that.

579
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
You can take your relationship to a deeper,

580
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
bettering level with Hulu Plus.

581
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
That's like Hulu,

582
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
but it makes Hulu look like dog shit.

583
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Whoa, don't say that.

584
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Whoa, come on.

585
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
It's much better than Hulu.

586
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,840
You can watch an insane amount of television.

587
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Parks and Recreation is on there.

588
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Here's one.

589
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Fox canceled my hit TV series,

590
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I Want to Marry Harry.

591
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
You son of a bitch.

592
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
How could you watch this?

593
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
But Hulu's like, give us your poor,

594
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
give us your tired, give us your hungry.

595
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,840
We'll put that whole series up online.

596
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
No problemo.

597
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
There's like a billion seasons of Survivor

598
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
and Amazing Race we've been digging through.

599
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
They just added Top Chef too.

600
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Nice.

601
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Block off a day to binge.

602
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Get in there, watch it all for eight bucks a month.

603
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Anytime, anywhere.

604
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
iPad, Roku,

605
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Xbox, whatever.

606
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

607
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,840
There are over 9,000 TV programs on Hulu.

608
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Vegeta.

609
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Gohan.

610
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Super Saiyan Gohan.

611
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
I mentioned eight bucks a month.

612
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
That's actually not for you.

613
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
You're too special for that.

614
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,840
You are gonna get a two week free test run.

615
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Piccolo.

616
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,840
If you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

617
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
we're gonna get you two weeks of access completely free.

618
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
You can try it out, watch a bunch of shows,

619
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
and then realize that your life has been missing

620
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
this entire time.

621
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

622
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
That's HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

623
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Man, that was a great ad, Griffin.

624
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,840
We're gonna have a lot of fucking sweet money

625
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
coming in from that.

626
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Frankly, I don't know what to do with it.

627
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah, they're gonna pay us a lot of extra money

628
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
because of how fucking sweet a job we do

629
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
at HuluPlus.

630
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I have an idea, though.

631
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I think we should go to Simple

632
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
because Simple's apparently the best bank ever.

633
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
It's the way banking should be.

634
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
They took banking and they said,

635
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
this thing's fundamentally fucked.

636
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Let's start over, start from scratch.

637
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Imagine, if you will, a checking account

638
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
with no minimum balance, no monthly fee,

639
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
no overdraft charge.

640
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
No fucking checks.

641
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
No fucking checks.

642
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
55,000 fee-free ATMs.

643
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
You can deposit checks with a photo

644
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
and you can spend without it being stressful

645
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
and terrible.

646
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Money can be fun again.

647
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Fun money.

648
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Thank God.

649
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Money is back.

650
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Money is back in a big way for 2014.

651
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
People thought I got done with money for a while,

652
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
but money is back.

653
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Money, Simple lets you save automatically

654
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
so you can tell it I have a goal

655
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
and it will help you reach that goal

656
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
because it cares about you

657
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
and it wants you to be happy.

658
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Just like Gohan helped Goku reach his goal

659
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
of becoming the ultimate Super Saiyan warrior.

660
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I don't think we can do that.

661
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Okay.

662
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Simple.com, you know what was nice?

663
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
I'm a Simple customer myself.

664
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
I signed up and I sent a message to them

665
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
because I had a question

666
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
and they just responded in the app.

667
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
It was not even a big deal.

668
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
They just chatted right back with me.

669
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
It's super nice.

670
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
They can pay your bills.

671
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
It's like a real bank.

672
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
They're not just going to take your money

673
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
and put it in their butts

674
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
and then fly to Cuba or something.

675
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
The thing is so popular

676
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
that there's a waitlist right now,

677
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
but we can help you get past it.

678
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
How can we do that?

679
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Simple.com slash my brother.

680
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Go there.

681
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Go get your banking right.

682
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Wait till you get your money right with Simple.

683
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
That's the new thing I've been working on for them.

684
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
The jingles are back also in a big way,

685
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
just like money.

686
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Hey, Jacqueline.

687
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Jacqueline.

688
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Yes, you Jacqueline.

689
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Got a message for you from Brendan

690
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
who says,

691
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Hey, Jacqueline.

692
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
You sure did graduate, didn't you?

693
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
By the time this reaches you,

694
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
we'll be living in a sweet new house.

695
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
I'm so stupid lucky to be able

696
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
to come home to you all the time.

697
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
So much love.

698
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
That's usually what we think

699
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
is something funny to say here,

700
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
but that just sounds like a nice situation

701
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
you have going on over there.

702
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Jacqueline, you're nailing it.

703
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Jacqueline's doing really good.

704
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Got a sweet,

705
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I don't know the nature of the relationship,

706
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
but I'm just going to say lover.

707
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Got a sweet lover in Brendan.

708
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Got a new diploma.

709
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Got a new house.

710
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I bet it's a real big,

711
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
maybe like 2600 square foot ranch style house

712
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Oh, that sounds like a white picket fence.

713
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
White picket fence.

714
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Somewhere that's green.

715
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Got another message for Will.

716
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Congratulations, Jacqueline.

717
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Yes, so proud.

718
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Got a message from Will Lilspoon Barley.

719
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Love it.

720
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
That's Will Lilspoon Barley

721
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
from Jeff and Jesse.

722
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Presumably they're the big spoons.

723
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Congratulations.

724
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
One of them has to be the biggest spoon, right?

725
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
One of them is the largest.

726
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
One of them is the soup spoon.

727
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Congratulations to Dr. William Lilspoon Barley

728
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
on receiving his Ph.D.

729
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Will channeled the power of his favorite

730
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
warrior cat Bramblepelt

731
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
to finish his dissertation.

732
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Thanks to the Brothers McElroy

733
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
for helping Will become a fake doctor.

734
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Starting this fall, he'll be a professor

735
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
at the University of Illinois,

736
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
so might provide some future

737
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
farm wisdom.

738
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I have so many questions

739
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
about his whole scene.

740
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Did he get like a Ph.D.

741
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
in agriculture?

742
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah, I think maybe there was a missing bit

743
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
of information there that would

744
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
inform that, because I don't know

745
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
why being a professor

746
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
in Illinois would inherently

747
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
make it,

748
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
you know, make you more likely

749
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
to come up with farm wisdom.

750
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I think if you're in the agriculture business

751
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
and your last name is Barley,

752
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
that's a pretty fucking good start.

753
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Yeah, you're like halfway there.

754
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm Dr. Jack Carrot.

755
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
My name is Dr. Jack Carrot.

756
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Hi, I'm Dr. Jack Lettuce, and I'm here to

757
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
teach you about how to get

758
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
sweet vegetables from the ground.

759
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
The top gains. I'm gonna blow out your lettuce

760
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
with sweet gains.

761
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
I'm also the creator of Farmville.

762
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
So, congratulations, William.

763
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
And thank you for listening to our program.

764
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
And now we're gonna head back

765
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
to live us

766
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
and Travis

767
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
back when he was alive.

768
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
I miss him.

769
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Miss you, sweet boy.

770
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Uh...

771
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
I need a fucking palette cleanser is what I need.

772
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Does anyone in the audience

773
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
have a question?

774
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Yeah, come on down.

775
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Do you remember the criteria?

776
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
We explicitly outlined the criteria.

777
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Do you understand the fucking dangerous game

778
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
you're playing?

779
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Every time you call someone up, it is the scariest...

780
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
It's the most dangerous game.

781
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
It will get savage.

782
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Hey, guys.

783
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
We will savage you if you fuck this up.

784
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
No pressure.

785
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Now, don't be shy. Get up close to the mic.

786
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Yeah, I actually did get up close.

787
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Okay, too close.

788
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
So, my roommate and I just moved in to a new place.

789
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Okay.

790
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
And we found the last person's checkbook.

791
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Oh!

792
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Actually, you found Will!

793
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
You've come to the right place.

794
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
How much do I take?

795
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Oh, my God.

796
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Okay.

797
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Whoa, criminal!

798
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
I thought the question was going to be like,

799
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
what's the easiest way to get back to them?

800
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Is there information on this checkbook?

801
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I can use to locate this person.

802
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Here's the thing. You're going to need to write $1,000,000.

803
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
I didn't get your name.

804
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Sam.

805
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Okay, so you're going to blank check it, right?

806
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Yeah, right.

807
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Let me figure this out.

808
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Just write $1,000,000,000.

809
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Okay, here's what I want you to do.

810
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Give another friend.

811
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Sit on their shoulders.

812
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Put a checkbook on them.

813
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
And go to the bank.

814
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm a nice little tall man with a very big heart.

815
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I'd like to withdraw $1,000,000,000.

816
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Please.

817
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I think you're in prison for fraud.

818
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,840
I would like to turn this into this mini, please.

819
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Hello, I'm a grown up.

820
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,840
And I would like to exchange this for a deposit half.

821
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Yes, my name?

822
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Herschel?

823
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Grown up.

824
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
That's me.

825
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Can you ransom the checkbook off?

826
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
That's the thing.

827
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Don't write any checks because that's illegal.

828
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
But ransom is...

829
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
You can sell it to...

830
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
You're not a bad person.

831
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
You're not going to write a bad check.

832
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
But you could sell it to a worse person.

833
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
You seem like the kids.

834
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
$30, please.

835
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
You could also just make the check out

836
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
for a non-money denomination.

837
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
But try to cash this person's check for like one hug.

838
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,840
And then the video goes viral.

839
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
I don't have that sense.

840
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
This man asked for a hug with a check.

841
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
You won't believe what happened next.

842
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
He didn't get it.

843
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
He did not get it.

844
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
He was arrested.

845
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
That's not how checks work.

846
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
You're just looking for an excuse to touch me.

847
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Nice try.

848
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,840
I turned you down for a Facebook video.

849
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Why do you think...

850
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Let's have a...

851
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Here, let's go less answer, more intervention.

852
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Okay.

853
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Don't commit this crime.

854
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Sam, no.

855
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Sam, everything is working for you right now.

856
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
You got a room and a place to live.

857
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
You can't jeopardize your future like this.

858
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Let me throw this out.

859
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Take these checks.

860
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Make a framed collage.

861
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
They're just account numbers.

862
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
When friends come over, you want all yours.

863
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You can use whatever you want.

864
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Take the account information.

865
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
You're saying you give these checks out like party check.

866
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Yeah, you just hand them out.

867
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Let them tear one off as they leave.

868
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Here's your check.

869
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Rather than being the victim of identity theft,

870
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
you want them to be caught in some sort of

871
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
insane psychosexual web

872
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
where hundreds of strangers

873
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
have access to their checking account.

874
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
That'll be more palatable.

875
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
How do I monetize that, though?

876
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
That's a fucking fine question, Sam.

877
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
It's not a question.

878
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
It's not even a question.

879
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
It's a paper chase.

880
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Life is so much bigger than forged checks.

881
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
There's so much more out there for you than that.

882
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
You could go through,

883
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
if they balance their book,

884
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
you could look at all the purchases they made

885
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
and then go out in the world and make all those purchases

886
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
and win a day in their lives.

887
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
And just tally Mr. Ripley up.

888
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Yeah.

889
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Well, spoilers.

890
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
In a way.

891
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Sam, thank you so much for joining us.

892
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Do we have any more?

893
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
More questions?

894
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
We've got a hot question right here.

895
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Come on up.

896
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
This is favoritism.

897
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Hey, how's it going?

898
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
My name is Brent.

899
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Hi, Brent.

900
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Well, I have a little big problem

901
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
and a little big problem.

902
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
It sounds like the audience is angry.

903
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
They sound like they're saying, oh.

904
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I get it.

905
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Small problem.

906
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
You know the criteria.

907
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Yeah, I do.

908
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Small problem and a big problem.

909
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Small problem, I could really use a Pepsi Max.

910
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
That's the first problem we've ever solved!

911
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Yeah!

912
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Yeah!

913
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Yeah!

914
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Big problem.

915
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I have a magically cute dog.

916
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Now let me explain.

917
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
This dog needs exercise.

918
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
He's five months old.

919
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
He needs to expend the energy

920
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
so he's not aggressive around the house.

921
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
He's magically cute.

922
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I can't make it one block

923
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
without the foot traffic of New York City

924
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
stopping to make a comment

925
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
and make me feel obligated to not keep walking

926
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
because he's so fucking cute.

927
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
What do I do?

928
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I make either myself or my dog

929
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
more standoffish

930
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
or more unapproachable.

931
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
You're doing it great.

932
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Thank you.

933
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Come on, we're pals.

934
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Wait, it's fine.

935
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
We're going to have to ugly your dog up.

936
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Can you buy the dog Uggs?

937
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Like mini Uggs?

938
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
You understand that Ugg

939
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
doesn't stand for ugly, right?

940
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Women don't wear Uggs

941
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
to be like, I need to ugly myself up

942
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
and stop trying to fist bump.

943
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
I don't know, have you ever seen Uggs?

944
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
I got to go to the bathroom.

945
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Holy shit, it's actually happening.

946
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
Brent, you want to hop in here?

947
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
No way.

948
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
You can advise yourself.

949
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
This is my friend.

950
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
We've done a bunch of live shows.

951
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I thought, what if I have to pee

952
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
in the middle of a live show?

953
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
You got to make sure Brent's there.

954
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Pressure's on.

955
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Pack your bags, move away.

956
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
I don't care.

957
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
His question was boring.

958
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
I just want the Pepsi Max.

959
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
The Yahoo answer.

960
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
I got to say, this is kind of weird.

961
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Totally.

962
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
It's asked by Jacob Locker.

963
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
What are you going to do when Justin gets back?

964
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Just sigh and walk away.

965
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

966
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
It's asked by Yahoo.

967
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
She has 1%.

968
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
According to this,

969
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Are you sad for someone on Yahoo?

970
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,840
She has negative 47 points this week.

971
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
It's a bad week for Jim.

972
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
She should find a different social media platform.

973
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Fuck, he's already back.

974
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
This has been a pleasure, you guys.

975
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
See you later.

976
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Do you want to talk about it?

977
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Not much to say, my man.

978
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Just to catch you up,

979
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
We're doing a Yahoo answer.

980
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

981
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
It's asked by Yahoo answer.

982
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Then we made some jokes about

983
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
She's not very good at Yahoo answers.

984
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Then everybody laughed.

985
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
It was a really great moment.

986
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Is this like that bit in That Thing You Do?

987
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
It's really clicking with this new guy.

988
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
We did.

989
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
You already did with That Thing You Do bit.

990
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,840
What if my fiancé gets an erection during our ceremony?

991
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I am 35 and my fiancé is 38.

992
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Wait, hold on. Stop.

993
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
I'm going to stop you right there.

994
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Why do their ages come into play in this class?

995
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Before we go on,

996
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
I want to talk about erections and our ages.

997
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
I thought I liked 35.

998
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Erectioned out.

999
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
I did.

1000
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I am 35 and my fiancé is 38.

1001
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Our wedding is set for October.

1002
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay, here's the issue.

1003
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
I love that.

1004
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Here's some groundwork.

1005
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Now let's go.

1006
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
He gets erections very easily.

1007
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I am not complaining.

1008
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
I can't believe you have such a low Yahoo score.

1009
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
This is a very titillating question.

1010
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Was there no wink? No winky face?

1011
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
No, there's not.

1012
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,840
But I have to admit, it feels like I am dating a teenage boy sometimes.

1013
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Even if he just holds my hand,

1014
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,840
he will often sport a noticeable erection.

1015
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,840
So she's checking.

1016
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
It's kind of unavoidable.

1017
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
It can be a little awkward not to mention

1018
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
when he walks around the house naked sporting one.

1019
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Okay, that live part was fucking unnecessary.

1020
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
It was pretty bad.

1021
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I didn't cut that out for the event.

1022
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I am just wondering how to handle this

1023
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
at the wedding and reception.

1024
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
He is nervous too. Any tips?

1025
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I am just worried.

1026
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
When he gets all the erections.

1027
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
It can take a long time for it to go down.

1028
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
I am sure people will snicker and take pictures.

1029
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Which would be good for him.

1030
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Ow! A nice boner, Jerry!

1031
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Quick, quick!

1032
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
You hurt everyone!

1033
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Jerry's boner!

1034
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Idiot!

1035
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Meemaw, did you see his boner?

1036
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Jerry, you idiot!

1037
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
All I can think is that it sounds like

1038
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
this is a pretty defining characteristic.

1039
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Yeah.

1040
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Anyone at the wedding is going to be surprised.

1041
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Meemaw is like, oh no, it's his boner.

1042
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah, we all know.

1043
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
What are you going to do?

1044
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
I am going to be honest.

1045
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
The ceremony wasn't perfect.

1046
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
But it felt like you.

1047
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
If he didn't get a boner,

1048
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
we will be like, who's wedding is this?

1049
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
It was your story.

1050
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
It was your story.

1051
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Your story wasn't, you look beautiful.

1052
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
And Jerry had a boner.

1053
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I noticed that's what rocked

1054
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
the hardest don.

1055
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
His don was hard.

1056
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
That's your truth.

1057
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,840
I thought it was so fun

1058
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,840
the groundwork to

1059
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,840
maintain.

1060
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,840
But it doesn't matter.

1061
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
It didn't stop that.

1062
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
The surface of the boner

1063
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,840
just ripped right through that comfort bone.

1064
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,840
You know the beast is loose.

1065
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Your hair looked perfect.

1066
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
His vows.

1067
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
The vows of the boner also.

1068
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I did want to mention again,

1069
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
we all had a great time.

1070
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Listen.

1071
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,840
You are going to kiss,

1072
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,840
assumedly, at the end of the ceremony

1073
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
there's a smooch.

1074
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
And if touching hands, if fist bumping your wife

1075
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
is enough to take the bones out.

1076
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,840
Like a smooch?

1077
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Wait, hold on. There's a bigger problem

1078
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,840
here that this man needs to live his life

1079
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
like the boy in the bubble.

1080
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Like any physical contact.

1081
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
You know what I mean?

1082
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Maybe he just needs to live at home.

1083
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
I was happy he was getting married.

1084
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Because it takes a very certain kind of person

1085
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
and that's the one.

1086
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Yes, forever.

1087
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
That's fantastic.

1088
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Well, she's not complaining.

1089
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
She listened.

1090
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

1091
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Or the super just awesome boner.

1092
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Yeah, that'd be rough, man.

1093
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
I don't really have any questions about horses.

1094
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
It's weird, right?

1095
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
It is weird.

1096
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Does anyone here own a horse?

1097
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
I want to talk about it.

1098
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Like owning a horse in town?

1099
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Has anyone here touched a horse?

1100
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Dog pound?

1101
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
You ever touch a horse?

1102
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Tell us what horses feel like.

1103
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Is that what we're doing?

1104
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,840
It's our new segment.

1105
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
What do horses feel like?

1106
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Are you ready?

1107
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I've been saving this one.

1108
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
I live in New York City, obviously.

1109
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
And walk anywhere.

1110
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Because nobody would come from out of the city

1111
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
to see his show.

1112
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Who came from an hour away?

1113
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
This is fun.

1114
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Raise your hand.

1115
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Who came from two hours away?

1116
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
I think in New York everything is two hours away.

1117
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Three hours?

1118
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Three hours?

1119
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Four?

1120
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Three and a half?

1121
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Four?

1122
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
Five?

1123
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
How long do we make this game?

1124
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
Anyone, six hours.

1125
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
Find me after the show

1126
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
and I'll give you one item from my wallet.

1127
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,840
I live in New York City

1128
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,840
and walk anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours a day

1129
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
thanks to my community.

1130
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
No matter what kind of shoes I'm wearing,

1131
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,840
socks or tights,

1132
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
I have bits of city grit in my shoes,

1133
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
annoying me until I can find a discrete moment

1134
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,840
to clean them out.

1135
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,840
The worst is when I get stuck in a situation

1136
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
where it's not socially acceptable

1137
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
for hours on end to escape and rectify the situation.

1138
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
It happens most often with my dress shoes,

1139
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,840
so I'm frequently stuck

1140
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
in a work meeting or at a fancy event

1141
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,840
with bits of debris

1142
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
making me nuts with every step.

1143
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Does this happen to everyone?

1144
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
Is New York City just extra grimy?

1145
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Am I just bad at wearing shoes?

1146
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
What can I do to help?

1147
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
And that's from Barefoot in Brooklyn.

1148
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Are you here?

1149
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Do you have shit in your shoes right now?

1150
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Is that why you almost fell down?

1151
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Dump your shoe grit on our table.

1152
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Let us examine this.

1153
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
We'll find an origin point for each.

1154
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Now, not you, but everybody else who lives in New York,

1155
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
please raise your hand if this is an issue.

1156
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
No, clap!

1157
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
People at home can't hear hands raised.

1158
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
There were approximately 18 hands.

1159
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
So this is the thing.

1160
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,840
You have come to the wrong place.

1161
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
I don't know.

1162
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
The only thing we worry about getting in our shoes

1163
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
at West Virginia is four-leaf clovers

1164
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
or friendly smiles.

1165
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
I mean, it's a very different world.

1166
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
A mess.

1167
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
A mess.

1168
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
A light mess.

1169
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
A missile of a mess.

1170
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,840
I feel like in New York

1171
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
they could build

1172
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,840
on every other street

1173
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,840
corner

1174
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
like a foot-washing station

1175
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
and then

1176
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
those would work for that express purpose

1177
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,840
for maybe four minutes.

1178
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And then they themselves

1179
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
would be so covered in grit

1180
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
and small rocks

1181
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
that you would be unable to use them

1182
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,840
for foot cleansing.

1183
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
This is great because I love an opportunity

1184
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
to come to a city

1185
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,840
and then talk shit about it.

1186
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,840
You all got dirty-ass feet!

1187
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
I love it.

1188
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Big Apple dreams.

1189
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
Broadway dreams.

1190
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
And gross-ass feet.

1191
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
What are you doing?

1192
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,840
You wear boots and still just by the end of the day

1193
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840
it's like a small

1194
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,840
gravel playground.

1195
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,840
In your shoes.

1196
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
In your shoes.

1197
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,840
Don't you have anything else to say?

1198
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,840
I'm sorry. Move?

1199
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
What's your walking?

1200
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Do you do a lot of foot scoops

1201
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,840
or walking gait?

1202
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,840
What's your gait?

1203
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,840
Can you come down for a second?

1204
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,840
This is creepy in a way.

1205
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Come on down and walk in front of us.

1206
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah, come walk so we can...

1207
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Yes, come down here.

1208
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Oh, I've seen enough.

1209
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840
You're scooping stair debris.

1210
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,840
So just start

1211
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,840
over here and kind of walk.

1212
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,840
I want to see if I can figure out the problem.

1213
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,840
We have to explain to everybody at home

1214
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
that she is wearing like three-foot

1215
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
tall shoes.

1216
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Is the grit like throwing grappling hooks

1217
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
up your shoes?

1218
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
We must reach.

1219
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
They should be velcro-sealed.

1220
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,840
They're open? Okay, so let me see.

1221
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
I don't know.

1222
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
But I will say this, a confident gait.

1223
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
I do like a confident gait. Very hot.

1224
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
Thank you so much.

1225
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,840
Thank you.

1226
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Between these two,

1227
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
this one or this one,

1228
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,840
what do you more into?

1229
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
I would say the first one.

1230
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,840
How about this one was sent by Ira Ray?

1231
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Do you want to do it again?

1232
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
No.

1233
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840
Are you Ira Ray?

1234
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Who wants to know?

1235
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Are we getting royalties from that dude?

1236
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,840
The person who wrote the original song

1237
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,840
who nobody can remember the name of.

1238
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,840
James Ray?

1239
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,840
What's his name?

1240
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Jimmy Ray.

1241
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Right there on the tip.

1242
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,840
In the song.

1243
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,840
This young dude next to me

1244
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,840
was asked by somebody whose fucking account

1245
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
was deleted. I'm so sorry everybody.

1246
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,840
They asked,

1247
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
trampoline sex?

1248
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
With like

1249
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,840
twelve question marks.

1250
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,840
These people are fast to know.

1251
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
Is it safe to have sex on a trampoline?

1252
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
I have a friend who's tried it.

1253
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Can I just say real quick,

1254
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,840
this person just shook their head really like,

1255
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,840
no. No sir.

1256
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,840
Absolutely not.

1257
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,840
It's fine, but I wanted to make sure

1258
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,840
I really don't want the embarrassing increase.

1259
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,840
That's a good point,

1260
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
because if somebody gets up there and is like,

1261
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,840
ha, popcorn!

1262
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
That's probably a plus too hard.

1263
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Your partner bounces up twelve feet.

1264
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Can we all talk about like,

1265
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
clap if you've been on a trampoline

1266
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
in the past year.

1267
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,840
Awesome lives

1268
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,840
you guys are living.

1269
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
The fabric of trampolines

1270
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
is the worst.

1271
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
When you bounce and accidentally do a knee bounce

1272
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
and you come up and your knees don't, it's just bone.

1273
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Can you imagine

1274
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
trying to like...

1275
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,840
Well people die on trampolines

1276
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,840
normally.

1277
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
That's without the introduction of bits.

1278
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,840
Yeah.

1279
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
I'm just talking about bit related

1280
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,840
injuries.

1281
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,840
There's so many springs.

1282
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
You get a bit

1283
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
caught in one of them.

1284
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Kill me! Kill me!

1285
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
No, it's just the worst!

1286
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
If I got a bit in that spring...

1287
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,840
I want to be dead!

1288
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
I would start like a

1289
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
lobbyist group

1290
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
to get trampolines banned from life.

1291
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,840
I used to be a confident young man

1292
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
getting boners all the time.

1293
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,840
The plot of

1294
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,840
Superman 7 is that he gathers

1295
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,840
all the trampolines and he

1296
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
throws them into the sun.

1297
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,840
Sorry about your ruined bit.

1298
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
I feel like if you're having

1299
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
sex on a trampoline, there is a chance

1300
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,840
that you can get a rhythm going and be like,

1301
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
wow, this guy is great.

1302
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,840
There's a chance that you can balance

1303
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,840
inopportune moments and break it up.

1304
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Dog Pound

1305
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
Dog Pound knows what I'm talking about.

1306
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,840
You're a

1307
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,840
f**k, Simon.

1308
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,840
They f**ked on a trampoline this morning.

1309
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,840
You know how a Dog Pound

1310
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
does?

1311
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
I need myself

1312
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
in the face on a trampoline once in a

1313
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
while.

1314
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
I can understand why you wouldn't want to introduce extra

1315
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
solo. This was solo

1316
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
mission.

1317
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
He was just maximally

1318
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
into it.

1319
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,840
We used to play a game

1320
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,840
where you stand in a circle

1321
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
on the outside of the trampoline.

1322
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,840
You put a tennis ball on it and it would bounce you

1323
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
and you have to dodge the tennis ball.

1324
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,840
Can you somehow have sex while doing that?

1325
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
I guess my question is,

1326
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
why do you do that?

1327
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,840
How are you guys doing?

1328
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
I forgot y'all

1329
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
were here.

1330
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
What else we got? We got anything else? It's time to wrap it up.

1331
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
We can do one more. Do you want to do one more?

1332
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
Audience questions.

1333
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
Who's got a super quick question?

1334
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Anybody?

1335
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Dog Pound!

1336
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Dog Pound!

1337
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
First off, this person is going to tell us what horses feel like.

1338
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
What horses feel like? You said you touched one.

1339
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
So, so smooth.

1340
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Grab a seat there.

1341
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,840
What's your name?

1342
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
I would say Ghost Life.

1343
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Your name is Ghost Life.

1344
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Pete.

1345
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
Pete.

1346
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,840
I was wondering if I could get a picture

1347
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
of all your Triforce tattoos.

1348
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Travis is going to take his shirt off, but otherwise...

1349
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Which I am totally open to.

1350
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Can we do that after the show?

1351
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Or can we do it during the show? Let's take a vote.

1352
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
No.

1353
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
After.

1354
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
After.

1355
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,840
I mean, I can just pull a boob out.

1356
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,840
You were voting for after.

1357
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Okay.

1358
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Pete, did you have a query to help you with that?

1359
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
Or was it just the tattoos?

1360
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
Other than that, your life is going great.

1361
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,840
That's the biggest problem.

1362
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
You're at 99.9% if only you could see my boob.

1363
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
And get a picture with it important.

1364
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
Could I flip it on?

1365
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,840
Are you going to flip it?

1366
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,840
Is it going to be Saturn after we're done with sex?

1367
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
No, I already got my trampolines.

1368
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
Perfect.

1369
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,840
I'm going to be skilled today.

1370
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Maybe just towards Justin.

1371
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
If you have a question for me.

1372
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,840
I have three kids.

1373
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,840
I was just wondering if you had any advice.

1374
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,840
Pete, that's a good question.

1375
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
Is there anything that you would like to know?

1376
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,840
Give me the number one piece of pairing advice

1377
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,840
that I can then steal,

1378
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,840
re-appropriate,

1379
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,840
put on a t-shirt,

1380
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,840
and steal.

1381
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
He's looking.

1382
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,840
To be clear.

1383
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,840
One piece of pairing advice.

1384
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Five words that are applicable.

1385
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Now.

1386
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,840
Sex.

1387
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,840
I know we're talking about babies,

1388
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,840
but sexy maybe?

1389
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
Number one piece of pairing advice.

1390
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Pete, give me.

1391
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Put me on the spot.

1392
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,840
To be fair, Pete,

1393
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,840
you walk down and sat in the chair.

1394
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
You sat in the chair, Pete.

1395
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
Now you do your time.

1396
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Pairing advice, Pete. Give it to me.

1397
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
Don't even think about it. You're overthinking.

1398
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
They're not my problem.

1399
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,840
I'm theirs.

1400
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,840
Yes!

1401
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Yes!

1402
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Pete out!

1403
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
I'll be honest. I was worried

1404
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
that anybody would be able to ride to the occasion.

1405
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Pete,

1406
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
you rock and nail it. Dog power.

1407
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Dog power.

1408
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,840
How are those beers?

1409
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,840
They're still good.

1410
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
And then he reveals himself.

1411
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Pete was the hero of the show.

1412
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Pete's the hero of the show.

1413
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Pete saved it.

1414
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Pete saved the show.

1415
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Valuable.

1416
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Okay.

1417
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Folks, we are done.

1418
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,840
I want to get a final question from Griffin,

1419
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,840
but first I want to thank

1420
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
People's Improv Theater.

1421
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Thank you guys so much.

1422
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Thank you all.

1423
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,840
Thank you

1424
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,840
New York for coming to our show.

1425
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,840
On your way out,

1426
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,840
make sure to stop by. We got a bunch of new merch

1427
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,840
specifically for this show.

1428
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,840
So make sure you check it out.

1429
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
It's the fucking dopest.

1430
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Awesome patches.

1431
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,840
These button packs.

1432
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,840
The patch says Fraternal Order of Brothers,

1433
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,840
which is actually really funny.

1434
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Thank you. I was pretty proud of it.

1435
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
Amongst all these buttons,

1436
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
there's some real big winners.

1437
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,840
One is a picture of Griffin's face with

1438
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,840
I Ate All the Potato Chips on it.

1439
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,840
It's like the fucking best face.

1440
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
There's also an I Hate Sad Libs button.

1441
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,840
So make sure to pick that one.

1442
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
And an I Hate Sad Libs button.

1443
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,840
Travis almost busted my mouth with it.

1444
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
We were having trouble coming up with how to start the show.

1445
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I was going to do a Freestyle Sadler's Ride

1446
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,840
where I just started a sentence.

1447
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,840
He lied.

1448
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,840
I hate you Ron.

1449
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,840
The buttons are awesome.

1450
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,840
We've got bumper stickers out there.

1451
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,840
My other ghost is a horse.

1452
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
My other horse is a ghost is one of those.

1453
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
But we've also got these awesome tote bags.

1454
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
And our posters are out there.

1455
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,840
If nothing else,

1456
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
stop by and grab one of these postcards.

1457
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
It's got a coupon code on the back

1458
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,840
that will give you 20% off if you buy the merch.

1459
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,840
And I think you can only get these here.

1460
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
Yeah, only here.

1461
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
Don't tweet that code.

1462
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,840
We will also be out there

1463
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
after the show to meet and greet

1464
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
and sign things.

1465
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
For like 45 seconds.

1466
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,840
All I want to ask

1467
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
is just

1468
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,840
keep it coming people.

1469
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,840
I want to see all of you.

1470
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,840
That's all I want to say.

1471
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,840
I want to thank John Lauder.

1472
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
I almost made it.

1473
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,840
I got to get the last word.

1474
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
Why am I just fondling

1475
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
this banana?

1476
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Why am I fondling this banana

1477
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
for like 5 minutes?

1478
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
I want to say thank you to Sawbones.

1479
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Sawbones!

1480
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
They're singing my show

1481
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,840
ever.

1482
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,840
I think those kids are going somewhere.

1483
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Thank you for giving

1484
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,840
us a home.

1485
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Thank you to the theater.

1486
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
Thank you to you all.

1487
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
That's everybody.

1488
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Thank you, Meredith.

1489
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
It's by Yahoo Answers.

1490
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
I can't believe

1491
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
it's another fucking time.

1492
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Mr. Gusty asks

1493
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
does the movie Air Bud

1494
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,840
paint an unrealistic picture of

1495
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
even the most athletic dog's potential?

1496
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
That's good.

1497
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,840
I'm Preston Apple.

1498
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
I'm proud to be here.

1499
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,840
I'm proud to be here.

1500
00:58:51,840 --> 00:59:09,840
Thank you.
