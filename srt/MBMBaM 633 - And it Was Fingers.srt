1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,340

That's yeah, that was

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,080
That was sweet. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, I was gonna go different. I introduced I introduced the show and I was gonna go with like a

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,820
Beetlejuice, that's cool. Okay Griffin. You want to take a run at it? Yeah, I'll do

I love it. Love it. Never gets old. Welcome to our super scary

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,280
He had to have an agent or somebody early days. He like Mike Mike should we change it Mike?

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,680
There's a pretty well-known guy and he kills babysitters bad guy. You want to change it Mike? No

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,880
I'll go by Mike Myers. Well, Mike Myers has ever worn a William Shatner mask to Halloween. Just be like

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,960
Just a feel oh I said great

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
So what what are we doing?

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,480
Special it's a Travis's idea Travis. I don't want to steal your thunder. Go ahead and lay it out for us

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,660
Well, well, the idea is basically I'm while you're listening to this in the UK

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
Yeah, I know it's for I'm from the past and the future all at once time is a flat circle and you know

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
What I said coming up. It's the spooky times

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,800
It's just it's you know clock and so it's like let's do a Halloween special

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,200
So we had people send in some spooky Halloween questions, and I assume you guys prepared a lot of spooky Halloween bids

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Yeah, a lot of great stuff

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,880
Oh no

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, I have I have a mummy game. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I made up a mummy game

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Oh, there's a whole cornucopia of delights that I didn't even know awaited me

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,840
Yeah, there's a lot of prep so hard with all my bits. In fact, you know what? I'm

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,080
Deleting them. Okay. I deleted permanently all the great crap that I did because Griffin's got this mummy game

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah, that'll probably take up 45 minutes at least

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,060
Yeah, I'm gonna erase the question list. Let me erase the question list so we

44
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,540
Know oh no, and this and then I'm tweeting the or changing the name of the show to mummy boy mummy's boys

45
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,900
Yeah, mummy's boys and cuz it's just gonna starring Griffin

46
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,420

47
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,200
Okay, so this is the first round okay of the mummy game, okay

50
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,040
Here's the first round. The first round is called the first round is called

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
under wraps Oh

52
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Yeah, and this one I have a secret and you guys gotta have to guess it are you a mummy

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
You didn't prepare anything. No, that's not it. Next. Yes

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,360
You're trying to bring back your long-lost bride on knocks on a moon. No, that's not it next

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
So do you give us a hint?

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,400
You're all scarabs. That's right. Justin got it. I'm all scarabs. I'm all scarabs inside

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,280
uh

60
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Sure feels like it some days

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,320
because

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,920
That's the first round of the mummy's maze. It's called under wraps

63
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,280
The second round of the mummy's maze is called the pyramid of shame

64
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,720
Oh now a lot a lot of lesser people. Yeah said I want to space this out

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Let's do some more the regular episode and I'll come back for round

66
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,560
No, I just want to get I just want to be done with the mummy's maze

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,480
I came up with it, but I also fucking hate it. Oh

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So it's like one of my beds

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,640
Yeah, like I came up with it last night in a sort of dream

70
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Sweat like the be Ronak gets in made him up, but then it tortured him. Yeah, he was like, this is so good

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,120
Fuck he's like, I don't want to make this to make it

72
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,320
I don't want to do the mummy's maze, but fuck like it has to get out

73
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Yeah, I have to get it out of me. So this pyramid of shame

74
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,040
Yeah in this one. We're gonna

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,800
In this one, we're all gonna tell people what we're super ashamed about

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, wait, we have to yeah and the big and the idea is it's a pyramid, right?

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,720
So you want to start big? Okay, you go for a shame a big shame a huge shame a big shame

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Mmm, gosh, go ahead Griffin. Yeah. Yeah, if Griff's gonna go first. Yeah, sure. Okay, I

79
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,980
Just I add a party

80
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:52,740
Um whenever there's a party I usually don't get I don't get invited to those very much. Oh

81
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,440
And that's a shame that's something you're ashamed of yeah other people go

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,220
To them and get invited to them other dads. Yeah, I guess I should say now that my boys in school

83
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:12,500
Other dads like really have you guys noticed brief sidebar? All the other dads know each other

84
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,780
Okay, we can agree on this all the other dads know each other, correct?

85
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,180
Yeah, they walk in and the party don't start till that dad's there then that dad every dad knows every other dad

86
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,700
every other dad and this dad and they and they're over there over there and they're over there talking about like

87
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,140
How to repair their like sports projectors

88
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,140
Unless it's a car or not. I know how to repair things unless it's a relationship. Anyway, that's my shame

89
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,100
But I laid the first brick of shame. Okay, my shame is that I've been mine was real and raw

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,860
Mine was real and rock. Go ahead. Just to remind you. I've been telling the other dads not to invite Griffin to parties

91
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Justin do you know about it? Um, you know, it doesn't work if you're not I think my younger in my younger days I

92
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,740
was not as thoughtful of a person as I like to think I am now and I feel like

93
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,620
That if I've been more dialed into that, you know, like thinking about other people rather than just myself

94
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,420
I would have had sort of more friends and connections. That's great. Maybe more dads would maybe more dad

95
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,860
Maybe maybe this is an issue. We all still suffer from and that's why dad's hey

96
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,060
Dad's hate this one. You can see the possibility for me. Is that these same dads?

97
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,380
Were already popular. Oh, yeah sure now they're just like still

98
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,740
still

99
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,060
Popular right ads, but they're dads now and I'm still not in there

100
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,140
Oh, here's my shame, even though I'm really excited whenever a new mission impossible movie comes out

101
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't really have a lot of passion regarding Top Gun Maverick and I don't know why it just doesn't do anything for me

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,820
But like the idea of like oh another mission impossible fuck

103
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,340
Yeah, but then they're like and they made another top gun. I'm like that doesn't doesn't click for me for some reason

104
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,460
I see people on planes watching it and it seems like they're having a really good time

105
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,820
They enjoy it, but I I just can't seem to get interested in watching Top Gun Maverick for this next round

106
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,320
We're not even rented it. I paid a rent on my iPad and I'm on

107
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,200
Bathroom paper go get bathroom paper for then. These first two rounds are hard because

108
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,940
The first two rounds are hard because you have to really dig deep and say a bunch of stuff about yourself that maybe you don't

109
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,220
Want to say in front of our audience, but that's just loosens you up for the third round, which is a fun one

110
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,020
Okay, and this round is called under wraps and but it's not but this round is called under wraps and for this

111
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,100
You'll need bathroom now Griffin, but the first round was called under wraps for this round

112
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,580
You'll need to do bathroom paper Justin's returned Justin has some we are actually rationing it in my home

113
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,540
So I can I use wrapping like can I use toilet paper with the guys?

114
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,900
I mean you don't get to play this round. I just it's just Justin gets to play it

115
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,300
Okay, and Justin you have ten seconds to turn it itself into a mummy ready set go one

116
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,020
the neck for three four five six seven eight nine

117
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,780
Ten oh stop. Don't wrap any more stop put the tissue down put the bathroom paper down

118
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay

119
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,620
That's not a very good job. No put it back on the roll though cuz somebody's gonna use that

120
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,380
Now sit there like that for the rest of the podcast Wow wait question though. Yeah, do it. So

121
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,580
Well, he didn't get to do it

122
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,540
He didn't get to do it cuz he wanted to fake it and he's been faking it this whole fucking time

123
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,020
But you my road dog you've been over there the real

124
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,980
Realist the realest mummy is what you are

125
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,540
Now hold on can we jump back cuz I don't think it's fair that you get to judge my level of shame about not watching

126
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,980
Top Gun Maverick because for all you know that might be the biggest shame in my life

127
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
I don't have a lot to be embarrassed by

128
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,900
Everything I've done is perfect. Yeah, hey, bud

129
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,220
Man I'm gonna let me take a long hard look Justin wins the mummy's maze your next year when we play it

130
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,980
maybe Travis will get his head out of his ass and

131
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,220
And actually engage with the sport of it that I worked all night long to prepare

132
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,940
That's actually my greatest shame is that I didn't go for it. I'm sorry. All right. Well save that for next year

133
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,160
I'll say one this time this feels more like you know what this feels less like a Halloween episode

134
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,580
And more like a Halloween party at school. Yes, kind of like and I thought about it. Like why can't we have

135
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,580
Why can't podcasts have like hard a party? Yeah

136
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,980
Thank you, this is like our office. This is our office party. This is our like our office party

137
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,280
I don't know why podcasts can't have party episodes where it's just like yeah, they weren't really

138
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,680
You know trying to make it good. Yeah, like they were just but they seemed like but they were hanging they were having real

139
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,980
Yeah, they brought in a lot of individually

140
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,060
Pre-packaged foods so that it was nice and safe and everybody could enjoy a juice boxes and what-have-you. Yeah

141
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,420
Um, let's uh, let's ask one of your very scary questions here. Okay. I need some advice regarding tax on

142
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,940
This is cruel

143
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,100
Folks, you do it. This is cruel when you write them, you know who reads them. Okay, this is cruel. I

144
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Need some advice regarding

145
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,700
taxonomical

146
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,980
Accuracy nailed it does the term werewolf describe only the monstrous wolf creature of supernatural lore

147
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:44,100
Or does it describe both the monster and the seemingly innocuous person who becomes that monster is a werewolf?

148
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,100
Who is in her human form still a werewolf?

149
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
That's for lady lycanthrope

150
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Labeler in London, Ontario

151
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Well, am I a ghost?

152
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,340
No, no

153
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,180
Okay, but one day I'll be a ghost so like

154
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,740
By that logic you hope by that logic I'm I'm a ghost already. I'm already a ghost walking around a cliff

155
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,620
And I'm sorry, but I have to quibble. All right, because

156
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,960
I have to quibble

157
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,060
Once you become a ghost you can't go back to being a human unless you have the machine from Casper the friendly ghost

158
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm Chris. Correct. Your your thing is actually very dumb Griffin because if you now I didn't say that

159
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,020
Well, let me go ahead and Justin can say shit like that because he won the mummy's maze

160
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,420
and that means that like he's in charge and he can say whatever he wants if someone's like hand me a piece of paper and

161
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,980
You get the trunk of a tree and you bring it to them and you say here you are

162
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,860
And then I'll say that's not paper and then you say well it will be

163
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:53,140
That's yeah, that's nothing. That's nothing. Yeah, I do think it's okay. Here's the here's the thing. I do think

164
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,840
They are well once they have been

165
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,200
Infected in some way once they're cursed once they're whatever what have you to become a werewolf, right?

166
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
and they change either at will or

167
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,200
under the force of the full moon whether they are human form or

168
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
Beast form they are now a werewolf

169
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,400
That said I think it's unfair and probably a little gauche

170
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,720
Probably like ruin a party if you see them in a human form like and you're a werewolf and like hey, hey, come on

171
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,280
Hey, that's not okay, but here's the thing that fucks me up all the time

172
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,720
Where werewolves here's the thing werewolf isn't real vampire vampire isn't real

173
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,440
Frankenstein zombie isn't real skeletons walking around dancing. Skeletons are real bones. Yeah. Okay skeletons are real

174
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
but

175
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,520
mummies

176
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,780
Mummies are real mummies are real in that wild that is wild

177
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,180
But skeletons are also real in that way Griffin

178
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,860
Not real enough to Griffin not walking around though

179
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,340
But they did it was some point guys I just drank I had an old coffee here from like zombie coffee

180
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Like just just ripped it nice, dude

181
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,560
Anyway, um, I don't think I think aware. I don't I think if you say oh

182
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
Werewolf and you point to just a person that's not that you are not being

183
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,720
Helpful, you may be being accurate with your language, but you're not being helpful. There is which there it is. Yeah, I think that's true

184
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,200
Yes, that's true. Good. That's it feels good to settle one, you know, yeah, sure

185
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,680
Um, hey, you know, who else is real the wizard and he wants us to learn

186
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,600
By way of Zack who sent it in how to live in a haunted house

187
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,080
This is a you just moved in and now you have had really bad feelings about the place

188
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,080
Chances are the place could be haunted you may be frightened, but don't be reading this. I really not buyers or more

189
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't worry about that and this economy is a ghost reading this article can help you cope with the ghost presence

190
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,360
It would be cool if you may be frightened, but don't be was a phrase

191
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
with any amount of

192
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,520
efficacy

193
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,040
Like whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah as a parent if I could

194
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Pull out that card from my deck that blue-eyes white dragon and slap it down and have one of my beautiful boys be like, oh

195
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Okay, that would be so sick

196
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,160
But here's how to live in a haunted house step one take a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd with you into the house now

197
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,640
Hey, I know that this just step one like ghosts don't care about dogs

198
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
What's the ghost gonna do?

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,160
Like the dogs gonna bite the ghosts like come on dogs easily detect the presence of the spirits

200
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
It will be daring to you also with the dog

201
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,200
What?

202
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
It will be daring to you also

203
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,400
With the dog. Okay. Okay. I just feel like clearly and I think we can all agree

204
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,120
Cats have much more of a connection to the spiritual world. Well, yes

205
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,720
And so like if I was going to take a guard animal in with me, it would be a powerful kitty cat

206
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,880
Yeah, but the cat the loyalty there is a question. There's a definite

207
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,600
There's a definite issue of like will they just be like, oh nice ghosts. No, that's fair. That's a good point

208
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Yeah, right away. I would want a big and I would want like a like an elephant or a rhinoceros something that like good

209
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,520
Yeah, cuz you can't see these thing. You can't see these dudes. So you want like something big that can

210
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,640
You know law of large numbers eventually is gonna impale him on his big

211
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,960
You know what if we're gonna do that, then just give me a drill bit Taylor

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,200
Give me a drill bit Taylor big old beefy Owen Wilson to go in in front of me to protect me from God

213
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,600
He looked so big and strong in that so fucking ripped in that man

214
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,560
Look like he ate Luke

215
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,120
Remind yourself that before you move anything into the house walk through the entire place doing this will give the ghosts a chance to scope

216
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,760
You out and accept your presence in their home. I

217
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,240
Did buy it. Yeah, that's the thing is that buying a house is

218
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
virtually impossible

219
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,080
today and so if that does happen and you've jumped through the

220
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
infinite hurdles that are

221
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,700
Terrible society is created between you and a home

222
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,420
I don't think I'm going to have much patience for a spectral hurdle

223
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:43,500
Yes, a dead a dead person who like already had their chance and frankly blew it. Correct?

224
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,940
Because they died like you had a chance to be the resident of this house and you fucked up

225
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,060
You know what Griffin you have you have just enlightened me made me realize how much like having a landlord

226
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,340
is like living in a haunted house where just like sometimes you come home and you're like wait something's different or like

227
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
Like you're like, should I fix that like no, we don't change anything

228
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,740
Yeah, if we if we change something they'll get mad and this is just sort of like a little

229
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,500
Marie Kondo tip from me from yours truly to you is that you should walk through the whole house

230
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Before you move anything into the house

231
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,380
Maybe before you buy it before you buy it even like you should you should see the whole house

232
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,700
I think before because otherwise you're just gonna like carry in a couch and then be like

233
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,980
This room looks this room seems like a good couch room. That's not a good way

234
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,180
Or you can walk a bike. There's no floor. I should have looked first. I should have made sure this house

235
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,200
I floors

236
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,900
Remember before moving all your stuff into the place move in as few items as possible at first this will avoid riling the ghost

237
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,660
Parentheses s ghosts to the changes going on during the transition from former occupants. Sorry ghosts

238
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:59,340
I only got my friends one pizza. I'm not doing pizza again for them. We gotta get everything in on this one Saturday

239
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,100
I got my dad's truck and my dad normally uses that truck on Saturdays and he rearranges schedule

240
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,740
I don't know what to tell you ghost. Do you have a truck? No

241
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,820
If it's a malevolent spirit like the ghost of a mummy or something like that. Yeah

242
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,300
Oh, that's the one then they're gonna be watching you like a hawk. And so I do actually think there is some great wisdom to

243
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,740
Bringing in the credenza first and then like the two ghosts the two mummy goes on your house being like I'm gonna fuck this

244
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,420
Dude's whole day up. But then the other one would be like Josh. It's a credenza like yeah, it's just a credenza

245
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,080
He's not gonna do but then you slowly like the next day. Maybe you bring in a futon

246
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,440
And you know murder by a thousand cuts which which is how most ghosts

247
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,300
Are made keep in mind while moving furniture or other objects in be alert for any feelings

248
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,600
You may have about where an item should be placed

249
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah, if you can make a ghost happy by placing a chair in a particular space

250
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,600
It could save you lots of trouble later on. Okay, so I guess they're saying that your feelings will mimic the ghosts

251
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,360
Feelings I guess like be aware of your feelings

252
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,560
Oh, okay. Hey, hey wiki how article

253
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,960
Are you saying that if my house wasn't haunted and I put a chair somewhere and I said I fucking hate this

254
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,300
Keeping that chair right there. This is this is the kitchen

255
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,120
Without any ghosts around there's no reason to not put a chair where I hate it

256
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,400
Well, we're carrying this couch through the kitchen to get to the family room, but I feel happy

257
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,880
So set it down because that's a ghost telling me that

258
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,840
Are you sure you don't want to just put the couch down? No, no, this is ghost feelings

259
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,320
Yeah, you don't even live here Doug. Just with the coach couch down. It's good

260
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,160
Try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life may have been like in the house if it is an old house and try

261
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,400
To do something former residents would have done in the house while they live there like eating some meals in a formal dining room or listening

262
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,440
To period music from the time the house was built

263
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,760
I feel like we've we that has come up in a different like dealing with ghosts scenario wiki

264
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,100
How because we have definitely talked about that if you try to say like I bet

265
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Well, you had a hard time with the plague because like fuck off dude, like you weren't there

266
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
I don't wanna hear it. No, but they're taught not talking about that

267
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,680
They're talking about get out the get out the the old, you know

268
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,800
Phonograph and should throw down the fucking Charleston and you will hear ghosts just like yes

269
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Yes

270
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,040
Fuck yes, it's

271
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:40,040
2022 what if it's a ghost from the 90s or something who are like what the fuck play some like where's my disk master?

272
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,200
Come on, man. Okay. Well, then you're gonna need sort of a now. That's what I have called music

273
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,920
But to the next point Travis try to talk about big events that would have happened while past owners would have been living here

274
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,160
For example on October 29th of a year try to talk about how past residents would have felt about the stock market crash in the beginning

275
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Of the Great Depression

276
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
How do you think I became a ghost you dick, yeah

277
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,720
Yeah, you know what? You can just you just play we didn't start the fire and if they're from that

278
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,800
Like that era they're gonna fucking love it

279
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,880
But this wiki article sounds like it wants specific day-to-day trivia

280
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
Yeah, it could be cool if you're just like sitting in your bedroom and ghost hovers up beside you

281
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,960
But okay, let's take a look October 10th. Hey, it's Susan Sarandon's birthday. Like the ghost is gonna fucking love that. Yeah flip

282
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,920
That's very grounding for me

283
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,720
Thank you

284
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,600
Avoid the area the ghost is in if they are in one particular place try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost

285
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Alone. Oh, yeah, the ghost will love that

286
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,360
That's like a mystery to that scenario of air wiki hell. Yeah. Yeah. Here's my broken rowing machine

287
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,040
You sleep in the room with that now idiot also wiki how?

288
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't like I shouldn't don't like it shouldn't have died if I can pinpoint where the ghost is

289
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,600
Yeah, I think I've got a lot more going on here than where to put like where to put the good TV or whatever

290
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,080
If it's like on the ghost also ghost ain't gonna stay in that one room. It's a ghost. Yeah, it moves around

291
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
Does the ghost do you think goes have to stay in your house?

292
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
house

293
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,200
We've definitely talked about this before but yes, I mean if you we I don't maybe it's been a while

294
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
I think that there should be a rule that if it's been like three years

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We're allowed to talk about the same shit again

296
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Cuz I feel like there's only so many things but if you see a ghost on the street that would fuck me up

297
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,460
I need them to be in a I need them to be contained inside of

298
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,960
Buildings. Well, the only way if they have very strong feelings about that Street

299
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,000
If they were like a crossing guard to like lived to protect that corner, I could see that happening

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah, but that's it. That's the only way but I don't want to try to spend a night and the old haunting

301
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,520
Dickerson mansion and then like make it to 1 a.m

302
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
And just be so freaked the fuck out that I have to get out of there and I run away

303
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,220
But then old man Dickerson is like floating with me like on my block and I'm like, what are you doing?

304
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,120
Like I got out of the house. He's like so what like so what I'm bored. I follow you now

305
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,840
But I think it would also be pretty positive experience though

306
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,680
If there's someone was like yeah, this house is haunted and you spend all night there

307
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,040
You're like, I don't see any ghosts in here and you look outside and there's like a ghost on the lawn

308
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,080
And you're like I live with that. That's actually that's fine. He's out there

309
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,760
Hey, try to spend a night in the place

310
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,040
Some goes try to communicate with the living through dreams the line that goes to get its message through to the living may put it

311
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,240
Into the haunting and send the ghost on its way. I would say if you buy a house try to spend a night in a place

312
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Hey

313
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,280
Give it a shot

314
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,500
It's worth it's worth an attempt. I hey slow down your jet-set lifestyles really keeping you away from your house

315
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,880
365 nights a year try sleeping that place at least

316
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah, you have you have a family that

317
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,500
Sleep in the house. Yeah the house except the ghost while this may be difficult for some to do

318
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,600
Most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence like, okay, you lift it up

319
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,120
My whole dining table to the ceiling and then you dropped it. So I saw that I saw that okay, like

320
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,960
Heard all day heard got it. Thank you. You're there you are there talk to the ghost

321
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,520
Let it know it is welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone

322
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,200
That's a slippery slope. I think why?

323
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,360
I just feel it just feels like if they slip up. Does that mean like

324
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,680
Spam email it's like, okay. Yes, and I'm not gonna reach out to you anymore

325
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,240
Yeah, and then what before you know it like more ghosts show up and you're like, hey and he's like

326
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm how is me having a ghost party that you can't even vibe with aside from like if you walk through one of us you

327
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,000
Get cold

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,160
Like how is that bothering you? Like how am I being a nuisance to you right now?

329
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:05,560
A living person also old to think that the concern here is that ghost doesn't know if it's allowed to stay or not

330
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,040
Yeah, the narrative here is really shifting but let's end it with this last bit

331
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,880
which is remember if the ghost does something scary, let it know you are upset and

332
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,680
That if such behavior continues, it will not be tolerated. So so just like

333
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Ah, no, no, no. Hey, listen, everyone's allowed to get frustrated. I understand that you're frustrated

334
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:33,040
I get that you're allowed to be frustrated, but we do not swing the dog around the room while going blue. That's not okay

335
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,100
That's not how we express our feelings. Do you understand? Hey, look at me. Hey, we're talking

336
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,040
Are you listen? What did I just say? Not we do not make a gooey portal on the ceiling

337
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,980
Okay, and pull and pull the little girl through it and then she gets in the TV now. Do you understand me?

338
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,300
Do you hear me? Do you want to sit down? Do you want to sit on the no-no step? Yep ghost

339
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,260
Do you want to be in the no-no crypt? You're going in the no-no crypt ghost because you are not listening

340
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,740
We're trying to do it. I see you. I see your eyes. That's a good choice. You made a good choice

341
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,220
Thank you ghost

342
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,300
See ghost I I love you so much and it's and it's why I'm not like I'm just disappointed I guess

343
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,740
Listen, I think I think there's no such thing as a bad ghost

344
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,420
I think there's just a ghost that makes bad choices. You know, let's make choices around here. And yeah, we can watch some iPad

345
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
What do you want to watch?

346
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,140
So

347
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,500
Yeah, there's not really any good questions after this

348
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,500
A lot of people have because we we really have plumbed the depths at this point

349
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,740
And I don't know that there's much else to like if there's more to say about ghosts like we'll be the ones to discover it

350
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:45,220
Yeah, I mean not something on wiki how but that's just that's just how to live in haunted houses. You got to talk to the

351
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,820
Ghost about all the cool stuff that's happened since the 1930s

352
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,980
But then also don't talk to the ghost and don't go near it. Let it have its space

353
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,580
But if it does try to fuck around then it's tell it it'll kill it again or whatever that ghost. Hey

354
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,940
You know what? No one talks about

355
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,180
The ghost flickers the lights and shit and like makes cold spots and it's like hey, man

356
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,500
That's my electric bill and my heating bill. Could you not like you please not?

357
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,280
Hey, you're scaring me. That's fine. You're messing with my financial. I just bought a house. Do you know how hard that is? Yeah

358
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,060
Anyway, that's um, that's ghosts. I'm having people over to my apartment for Halloween

359
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,380
And I've realized that I don't know any good ghost stories to tell I want to set the tone for the evening with something

360
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,880
Scary spooky, but I'm at a loss. Do you have any good ghost stories? I can use

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,800
alternatively, do you have a formula for a

362
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,560
Badass ghost story cursing that's from uninspired in Arizona a

363
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,960
badass ghost story

364
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,760
Cool, like like a cool ghost story. I think that no matter what I like the idea of a formula

365
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,560
I don't like the idea of sitting here and trying to come up with a ghost story

366
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,560
That sounds like comedy boys into me, but I mean the formulas formula we can work with formula simple, right?

367
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,360
It's got to start with something like oh, you know

368
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,400
It was blank years ago. Now. This is where it's tough, right? It can't be two

369
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Six months back in March

370
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,500
You've lived here since January, yeah, I know I was

371
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,720
I didn't tell you about this because not only is this a badass scary ghost story. It's an embarrassing one

372
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,760
It also can't be so long ago. You can't be like 500 years ago on this very spot someone

373
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Sure

374
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Absolutely, let's just pick a year

375
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
230 right

376
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,920
Too far. That's way too far 100. It was a it was 83

377
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,160
It has to be a round number

378
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I think cuz then it also it's like for some reason it's like a hundred years ago and goes like who an anniversary

379
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,920
What about what about one and you're like, let me tell you about the Holy Ghost

380
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,880
He's this guy that's pretty scary actually I did just get scared of being at a party and not happening

381
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,240
You know scary means life without him. So that's the beginning

382
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,560
That's the beginning obviously the end of the story

383
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,160
No matter what a common great element for a badass ghost story is if you keel over dead

384
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,700
Yeah at the end of the story and a ghost comes out of your body and like

385
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,640
And screams like happy Halloween and like flips over the table

386
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Yeah, okay. It was a hundred years ago and you had to drop down that at the end. Yes

387
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,060
Now, let me take it a little different. Okay, it starts like this. Hmm. Okay, it was

388
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:40,060
1989 years ago and a man he was put he died and he was buried but then

389
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,040
Three days later. He came back from the grave

390
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
read this literature

391
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,880
Oh pretty scary. Okay. I am so distracted. I'm so distracted by the fact that you set this

392
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,480
Bit in 1989. No, it was

393
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,300
1989 years ago. Yeah, right because he died when he was 33 Justin so it couldn't be

394
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,140
2022 years ago. I did you I did you the math?

395
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,760
Travis is we record with camera now and I Travis went to a

396
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Sunken place. Yeah

397
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,640
99 and that wasn't it. That was when Jesus had a righteous 23

398
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
The calendar begins on the exact day

399
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Yeah

400
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Any other good ghost story

401
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,720
One thing that I always think is very impactful and ghost stories is that

402
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,560
Someone is eating something that turns out to be a body part

403
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,720
Oh

404
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,520
Yeah, I mean like and yeah

405
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,280
And the payoff is always like this is I think the moment right before the death of fright is like and it was fingers

406
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,640
Oh, that's yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. I

407
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Know this is excellent. It was a hundred years ago. Uh-huh

408
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Something something something

409
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,280
and it was fingers and then

410
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,320
Dad dad

411
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,480
It helps if it's like relatable if it sounds like it happened to someone like that, you know, or like someone and so like just

412
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,880
Point at anyone in the room and be like they were there they can tell you

413
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,160
Yeah, and then when they deny it be like, maybe you're the ghost, right? That's cool. Like a second person sort of

414
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,640
horror story

415
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,140
Justin almost drink the back. I almost drink the back. You really need to tight tighten and it was fingers. Oh

416
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,400
Wait, is there something in this bad coffee? Is there something in this this? Oh, yes

417
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,760
They open to the universe bringing ideas to you a hundred years ago

418
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,520
I threw a party in their apartment that was and everybody everybody drank the punch

419
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,520
But he had put poison in it and kind of like this punch that you've all been drinking

420
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,240
Let's let's say it was my uncle. Yeah years ago my uncle

421
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes, because no one's gonna challenge you on it cuz that would be rude cuz it's your uncle

422
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,520
Yeah, my right is your uncle well enough to know if it really happened. My dad was a real lady

423
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,180
No, not my baby. No, cuz my uncle was there a hundred years ago

424
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,240
My uncle was 70 years old or to my dad 100 years ago. My uncle

425
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,080
My very good. Okay 100 years ago my six-year-old uncle and then it's like yeah, cuz he's a hundred

426
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,120
Yeah, he started living a good clean life and exercising

427
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,680
No, but on a completely hold on on an unrelated

428
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,120
He stopped eating chicken fingers cuz they were real fingers, okay, that's

429
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,840
Dead a hundred years ago a hundred years ago my very young uncle

430
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,480
This also sounds like a mnemonic device

431
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,400
My very young uncle just ate chicken fingers then stop because they were human fingers

432
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,960
But I never stopped eating the fingers and now I have cardiac problems

433
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,100
You're yeah, but that's like it's what you just added like a post credits

434
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:17,800
Scare that can't be after the end where you die right? Yeah, and I was the uncle the whole time and then you die of fright

435
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,480
Okay

436
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,920
Okay, then you die of fright. Yeah, that's gotta be and then you don't get up until everybody leaves the party

437
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,360
Yeah, that's also important and what's cool is like on

438
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,080
Different holidays you can use the story to use change different parts of it. Yeah, so like I so like for

439
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,320
You know for around Christmastime you can be like is it so saying it's a hundred years ago

440
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,640
Santa Claus and then something something something and then like be like he's eating fingers and then maybe you don't die

441
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,240
At the end of that story cuz yeah, you become more alive. Let's take a quick break

442
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,040
Travis I would prefer if you left. Oh

443
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay, I prefer Griffin and I do these alone. Can I come back after the money zone? Yes

444
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,960
Yes, but I prefer that this money zone just be something for Griffin and I is that okay?

445
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,440
I actually I need to use the rest. I need to use the restroom

446
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,360
So maybe Justin does it alone? Oh Griffin, you guys will be recording this in the future while I'm in the UK

447
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,780
Why do you need to I do need to go to the bathroom that's something you can just say as you

448
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,680
Hold on. Let me hold on. Let me think about this. Hold on. Let me figure this out cuz

449
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,240
We're recording this early because Travis is in the is not in America

450
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,620
I've been right now. He is right now Travis in America. We're recording this

451
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,740
Yes in the but in the episode when the episode comes out, he won't be in America. Sure. I need to pee now

452
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah, just try to calculate. He wants to make sure he's not gonna piss on camera

453
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,940
You can go pee now and then also when you adjust and report the money zone later if you need to pee then you can

454
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Also go pee that that's what I'm saying

455
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,860
To the episode when it comes out and you get to this point the episode this exact point. Hi

456
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:12,720
Yeah, you can pause your podcast layer and go pee then as well. Yeah, your options are limitless

457
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,380
Yeah, there's no no cause for concern really

458
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:22,180
But why wouldn't but why when we do that? Oh, we don't have ads. Sometimes they come in a little hot

459
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Huh? Is that what the situation? Yeah

460
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:32,260
There's that's one way of putting it. I'm gonna flip it on you. We're recording early because we're so responsible. Oh, yeah

461
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,740
Okay, and so I was setting up a thing where you and I will record that

462
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,220
We're gonna do it alone because Travis isn't not in America. This isn't in Ohio. Okay, good

463
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:57,140
Are you peeing your pants right now? You do have to tell me?

464
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:04,780
Wow, what a great episode so far that we recorded a hundred years ago. This is Griffin. I'm flying solo for the ads today

465
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Let's see if I still remember how this thing works

466
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,100
Squarespace is the all-in-one platform for building your brand and growing your business online

467
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:17,580
You stand out with a beautiful website when you use it you engage with that audience of yours when you use it and you can sell

468
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,740
Anything your heart could imagine your products content you create even your time sell your time

469
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,860
Sell it like in the Justin Timberlake movie just in time

470
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,980
Every Squarespace website and online store comes with a suite of integrated features and useful guides that help maximize prominence among search results

471
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,180
So when people you know Google mark Ruffalo

472
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,380
Jim shorts mark Ruffalo and Jim shorts and that's your website's gonna come up

473
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,940
First if that's what it focuses on and you used Squarespace to make it

474
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,040
You can sell pictures of mark Ruffalo and Jim shorts on an online store. Probably actually you can't do that because he

475
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,220
He would probably come after you

476
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:03,420
He's very litigious and they have powerful blogging tools you can use to share photos of mark Ruffalo wearing whatever he wears

477
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,580
You can categorize share and schedule your post to make your content work for you

478
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,780
we've used Squarespace to make all of our joke websites and some of our real websites and it could not be easier to use and

479
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,180
Easier to make something that looks real good head to Squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial

I have I've been buying some winter wear lately from brands online and

494
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,040
winter wear is it can get kind of pricey I guess because they use more fabric and

495
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,160
I

496
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Clicked the honey button and it found a little coupon code for me. I saved some bucks on it and I I did a celebration

Creator of goosebumps, you know, I don't really get too deep into the real fears

505
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,640
It's a lot safer to do a dummy coming to life. That's on the next bullseye for maximum fun.org and NPR

506
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,680
Ten in a little bit of a ton. What? Oh

welcome to Munch School I've a hood to

516
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,560
Did you see Count Donut Travis did it like you did it? That's wonderful. You're my hero. Welcome

517
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,400
Welcome.

518
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,240
It's a podcast.

519
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,560
Look, when I do it, it's like a,

520
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,080
like a, I'm gonna leave.

521
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,320
Yeah, pretty good.

522
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
Do you remember him?

523
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,980
Very funny, Griffin.

524
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,820
You ever watch that?

525
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,660
Thanks.

526
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,500
Aw.

527
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,340
Thanks, Count Donut.

528
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,920
One great Beavis and Butthead reference.

529
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,080
Thanks, I love them.

530
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,000
Welcome to Munch Squad, the podcast within a podcast

531
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,880
that profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating.

532
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,840
My name is Count Donut.

533
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,720
We've established that.

534
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,200
And I'm here to talk to you

535
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,200
about the latest innovations in the donut space.

536
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,120
Before I indulge,

537
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,680
does anyone have anything they'd like to say?

538
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,820
I like your beard.

539
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,660
Sorry, happy birthday.

540
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,360
Thank you, thank you, it's new.

541
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,600
Now that is weird because I thought vampires

542
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,880
don't like age or grow or change or anything.

543
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
It's a Rogaine!

544
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,480
I had it transplanted from somewhere else.

545
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,320
Oh.

546
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,600
When you said, it's a Rogaine just now,

547
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,760
it's so fucking weird,

548
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,060
but there's this other dude that comes around sometimes.

549
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,120
I forget his name, it's something like Johnny Stink,

550
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,120
but you sounded like him a little bit.

551
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,780
Can I ask you a question?

552
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,100
I've always wondered, Count Donut, is a vampire?

553
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,740
Yes, let's dig into the lore.

554
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,800
Obviously, as a vampire, you don't age,

555
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,100
and so your hair wouldn't grow, right?

556
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,060
Your body wouldn't make,

557
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,800
so if you get a haircut and you don't like it,

558
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,680
is it just, as you live forever,

559
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,080
your hair cuts just get shorter and shorter

560
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,080
until eventually all vampires shave their head

561
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,200
bellowed like Nosferatu?

562
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,200
No, Travis, the hair is grown,

563
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,500
but fed with blood, so I swallow the blood,

564
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,080
and then my excretions are through my follicles.

565
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,920
His hair.

566
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,400
But then your cells are making more hair,

567
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,240
which means they're aging.

568
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,720
No, I'm directly excreting.

569
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,560
He pushes them out.

570
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,240
Oh, like a Play-Doh fun thing.

571
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,960
Like a Play-Doh fun guy, yes, like a Play-Doh fun guy.

572
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,800
That makes all sense now.

573
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,280
Let's talk about Pink Box.

574
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,120
Like what?

575
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,360
And you ate that last word, Donut.

576
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,180
Let me try again.

577
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,680
Let's talk about Pink Box.

578
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,520
Pink Box?

579
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,360
Pink Box?

580
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,200
Pink Box, it's a frequent.

581
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,560
That can't be.

582
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Yes, it's a donut manufacturer based in the Las Vegas area.

583
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,600
Oh, of course it is.

584
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,400
Ghouls, goblins, and donut lovers alike

585
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,240
can get into this.

586
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,360
I'm glad that they've stopped being stuck in a binary.

587
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,000
Good job, Pink Box.

588
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,840
Well done, Pink Box.

589
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,880
Everybody, yes, can enjoy the spirit of Halloween

590
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,880
with these not so scary, but oh so delicious treats.

591
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,760
Be sure to stop.

592
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,520
Don't waste my time with this, Pink Box.

593
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,640
Scare my pants off with your baked goods, please.

594
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,840
For stop, Dean, if you just want a very long list

595
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,440
of creepy donuts of varying degrees of sanity,

596
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
Pink Box has you covered.

597
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,360
Oh, good.

598
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,520
First up is the Vampire, which I said like Bill

599
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,240
from True Blood for reasons that defy explanation.

600
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Vampire, it's a glazed raised ring with vampire teeth toy

601
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,600
and vampire decor.

602
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,400
Where, in the hole?

603
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,240
Where is it?

604
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,160
Did they give the whole, did they give the whole teeth?

605
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,960
And they're not like edible teeth, right?

606
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,600
These are plastic toy teeth.

607
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,920
Please remove them before eating.

608
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,640
I'll have my assistant, Beulah, pull up an image for you.

609
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,520
One moment, Beulah.

610
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,160
Well, this is new canon.

611
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,720
Yeah, I don't know how I feel.

612
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,560
Beulah!

613
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,400
Is this like a familiar situation?

614
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Did she pay you? The donuts!

615
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, actually, I see a little rat

616
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,280
and it's typing on a keyboard.

617
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,360
I actually love that. I don't know why

618
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,560
she can't make it bigger.

619
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,360
Okay, so we're looking at all the donuts right here.

620
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,920
I'm trying to, oh, okay. Don't skip ahead.

621
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,080
You see the vampire teeth.

622
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,160
Vampire donut.

623
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,200
Next up.

624
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,680
Oh, it does have a little bit more decoration

625
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,400
than just shoving some fake teeth in it.

626
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,960
Yeah, it's not just a glazed donut

627
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,400
with teeth in the hole.

628
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
It's adorable.

629
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,960
Vampire pool!

630
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,880
It's a chocolate cake topped with chocolate buttercream

631
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,800
covered with chocolate icing.

632
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,520
Halloween sprinkles and vampire decor

633
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,720
and it looks like human fecal.

634
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,240
Wait, hold on. Did you say vampire?

635
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,760
Human fecal matter!

636
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

637
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,440
The name of the, I thought you said vampire pool.

638
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,520
No, vampire pool.

639
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,120
And not the bear, the black bear.

640
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Isn't it funny how he looks funny, though?

641
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,880
Did you also think he said pool, Travis?

642
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,720
I did.

643
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,520
Vampire pool!

644
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,440
Okay.

645
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,760
Wouldn't vampire poo just be blood?

646
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,200
What it is is, yes.

647
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,760
Oh, no, hair. We've covered.

648
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,400
Wait, hair comes out everywhere.

649
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,680
Not just the top of your head.

650
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,720
Vision pumpkin!

651
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,600
Orange frosted raised shell topped with pumpkin decor.

652
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,440
That one's great.

653
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,680
That's a dead-on pumpkin.

654
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,920
I see that. That looks great.

655
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,760
And you know what?

656
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,760
What's great about that?

657
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,000
Remove the little pumpkin leaf on the top.

658
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,240
You can use that for March Madness.

659
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,200
That's a basketball, baby.

660
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,920
That's a basketball right there.

661
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,000
I want now to continue to draw you through

662
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,240
my tunnel of horrors.

663
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,560
Next up, and Travis, I apologize in advance,

664
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,280
for spider ring!

665
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,600
It's actually very cute.

666
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,440
It is a pretty cute little bag.

667
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,200
It's a purple frosted vanilla cake top

668
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,560
with spider web decor and a spider ring!

669
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,440
Oh, that one.

670
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, that does nothing for me.

671
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Creepy crawler.

672
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,280
Orange frosted raised ring topped with glazed cake peewees

673
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,880
and spider decor!

674
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,040
That one I like.

675
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,240
That one's pretty cute, too.

676
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,080
I like, actually.

677
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,280
That one is called I See You,

678
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,960
and it's a white frosted dough crow

679
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,520
topped with eyeball decor.

680
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,360
Well, that was fun.

681
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,160
Dough crow, by the way, I believe dough crow.

682
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,240
I believed when they realized crow nut was trademarked.

683
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,880
They took some other scraps of the word.

684
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,160
Because dough salt is also definitely taken.

685
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,200
Dough salt is taken, so they just got in there

686
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
and squished it all around.

687
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,320
Like my good friend Frankenstein.

688
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,640
Hey, I just want everyone to know

689
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,080
that I didn't see the real vampire doughnut,

690
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,400
and now I'm back to hating it,

691
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,960
because it is just a glazed doughnut

692
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,040
with teeth in the hole and two googly eyes on top of that.

693
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,320
They can make the teeth whatever color they want.

694
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,920
It still is a screaming doughnut that bites,

695
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,960
that does bite back, and it's miserable.

696
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,880
But I do want Count Doughnut to keep going,

697
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,920
because there's a couple on here

698
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,560
that definitely don't seem connected to Halloween

699
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,440
in any way. No, not at all.

700
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
Next up is Boo.

701
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,000
It's a white frosted raised ghost filled with orange-

702
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,120
Snooze, snort, yeah, fine, yeah, we see it, next.

703
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,320
White, I'm going to tell you the description of this one.

704
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,320
White frosted raised shell filled with lemon whip

705
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,640
and topped with Jack Skellington decor.

706
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,160
Now, I mention only this

707
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
because the name of this doughnut is Jack Lemon, which-

708
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,000
Ha! Ha!

709
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,560
Which to me is such a strange choice.

710
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Ha! Ha! Ha!

711
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,480
They must have known, it's so specific,

712
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,600
it has to be a reference.

713
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,800
This is the only reason you would choose this name,

714
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,680
is Jack Lemon, who died in 2001.

715
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,480
This is the grumpier old doughnut.

716
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,640
Grumpy old doughnut.

717
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,440
Not even someone I would connect to Halloween.

718
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,360
This man was in a movie with Marilyn Monroe.

719
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,520
You can't name a doughnut that.

720
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,040
So there's no way Pink Box got the rights to Jack Skellington.

721
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,000
They get the rights to Jack Skellington and Jack Lemon

722
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
for reasons that defy explanation.

723
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,440
Why is it called Jack Lemon?

724
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,280
Hmm.

725
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,480
The loopy Halloween, orange frosted raised bars

726
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,480
topped with fruit loops and Captain Crunch.

727
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,520
Yeah, that's the one that's just like,

728
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,240
they had some of those-

729
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,800
It looks like a coffin for a clown.

730
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,720
Okay.

731
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,920
Oh, that would have called it the clown coffin.

732
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,600
That would have been something.

733
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,040
But there's 13 doughnuts on here.

734
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,360
Frankie bar.

735
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,920
They did not need that one.

736
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,960
They did not need this mini green frosted raised bar

737
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,520
filled with Frankenstein decor.

738
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,440
Then there's strawberry mummy.

739
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,400
Strawberry frosted raised bar with mummy decor

740
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,240
and the Halloween mummy.

741
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,320
A chocolate frosted raised shovel with cookies and cream

742
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,800
topped with Oreo crumble and mummy decor.

743
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,120
And then lastly, at the end,

744
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,120
there's one called It's Your Birthday.

745
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,440
It's Your Birthday.

746
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,120
It's Your Birthday.

747
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,560
They don't want kids whose birthday it is.

748
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,960
You know, so many kids with Halloween birthdays,

749
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,560
they don't get anything.

750
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,400
They get nothing.

751
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,240
They get no recognition.

752
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,920
They get no attention.

753
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,320
But now Pink Box says, It's Your Birthday.

754
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,160
It's Your Birthday.

755
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,000
That's so good.

756
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,840
That's great.

757
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,680
Thanks, Pink Box.

758
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,200
And thanks to me.

759
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,040
Thanks.

760
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,280
As you know, I can only live for one night a year.

761
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
What?

762
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,600
Yes, this is the one day I could walk about the Earth.

763
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,160
And you stayed with us.

764
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,080
And I spent it with you.

765
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,360
What are you gonna do next?

766
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,280
I don't really, I don't pity you

767
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,120
because for you, that time, you don't feel that time.

768
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,960
You know?

769
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,800
It's like seven.

770
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,640
Well, you assume that, Griffin.

771
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,480
Hold on.

772
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,320
You assume that?

773
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,440
You go to sleep midnight 2022, Halloween.

774
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,200
You wake up, you know, 12.01.

775
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,280
I walk the Earth every night trying the donuts

776
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,200
that always cause me to retch immediately afterwards.

777
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,040
And the hair comes out.

778
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,920
Because I cannot tolerate them,

779
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,560
despite my love for them.

780
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,160
But this is the day that I could walk amongst the sunlight.

781
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah.

782
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,080
Oh.

783
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,880
That makes, I understand now.

784
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,520
You should check out an aquarium if you have time.

785
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,680
Yeah, do you know about like human stuff?

786
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,600
Sorry, what is an aquarium?

787
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,000
An aquarium is like a fish prison.

788
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,840
Yeah.

789
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,720
What is, wait, hold on.

790
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,360
A water zoo.

791
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,600
What is a fish?

792
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,760
Oh, well, this is actually really interesting

793
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,480
because there's not a scientific class.

794
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,360
Water kills me.

795
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,560
So I, but like, well, water kills me.

796
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,240
So I have never seen a fish.

797
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
Okay.

798
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,800
Now wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

799
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,200
Not even like in a book?

800
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,560
Or like when you were alive at some point

801
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,640
before you got turned.

802
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,520
What would I read?

803
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,360
Why would I read?

804
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,440
Why need I read?

805
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,640
But you didn't start off as like this spectral form, right?

806
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,840
You were alive at some point.

807
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,960
I don't know why you're trying to tell Count Donut

808
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,800
things about himself.

809
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,680
I at some point forgot how to read

810
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,840
and I've never thought to relearn.

811
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,200
I have no cause for knowledge.

812
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,040
You don't need that.

813
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,760
I thirst only for blood.

814
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,600
And Donut.

815
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,520
Have you seen a frog?

816
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,360
What?

817
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,440
Sometimes I see a frog.

818
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,800
And other times I have never seen a frog.

819
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,120
But you know what a frog, you know what a frog.

820
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,280
I see them sometimes,

821
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,200
but it seems like there are more that I'm registering.

822
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,520
Hey, Count Donut, just so you know,

823
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,440
that's the universal experience.

824
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,280
There's not a human being on Earth that's seen every frog.

825
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,720
Well, I suspect sometimes they're in water.

826
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,840
So I would have no awareness of that.

827
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,280
Okay, so now we're dealing with a sort of object permanence

828
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,200
when something goes in water.

829
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,760
It's a cruel trick of fate.

830
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,480
I am permanent while the world around me spins chaotically

831
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,320
and continues to evolve.

832
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,000
Well, no, when the frog goes in the water,

833
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
it's definitely still there.

834
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,360
It's still there.

835
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,080
Also the Earth rotation is pretty sad.

836
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,320
Hold on, Travis, hold on, Travis.

837
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,200
Don't just say yes.

838
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,840
People feel bad for me

839
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,000
when I have not been on the show for a while,

840
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,920
but truly they should feel bad for you

841
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,600
because this is the one moment you exist

842
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,280
when I am perceiving you.

843
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,600
Oh, I see, oh no.

844
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,520
Whoa.

845
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,680
Right.

846
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,120
Count Donut, what a skewed view.

847
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,320
One thing about me.

848
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,120
Hold on, I'm thinking, yes.

849
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,400
One thing about me is I lack object permanence.

850
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,560
So you do not exist to me when I'm not directly

851
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,960
looking at you.

852
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,480
It's cool that you're aware of that.

853
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,880
Like that's a huge, that's a power in and of itself.

854
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,960
Yes, my wife Drew Barrymore reminds me every morning

855
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,800
when I awaken.

856
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,440
Whoa, wait, what?

857
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,640
Yes, I live on a boat with Drew Barrymore.

858
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,560
So when you say you walk this Earth, try and go there.

859
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,120
Well, I walk onto the pier and then I walk the Earth, yes.

860
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,720
Okay, but every night.

861
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
And then you go back to your boat home.

862
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,080
Your boat home, which is about as close to living

863
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,520
in the water as you can get without living in the water.

864
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,320
You've never even looked over the side of your boat home

865
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,880
and seen a fish.

866
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,080
You've never been like, what's that in there?

867
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,760
I thought it was part of the water.

868
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,160
Have you been to Red Lobster?

869
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,720
Red Lobster, I like the red part.

870
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,160
I feel like if I ate crates-

871
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,280
No, come on, this is a land-based restaurant business.

872
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,360
And I know Drew Barrymore goes there.

873
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,200
I know she's, I've seen her at Red Lobster.

874
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,440
Even if you're not eating there,

875
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,160
you would take her because you love her.

876
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,240
Yes, I have, fine, yes.

877
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
We can do this, like this if you like.

878
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,080
I have been to Red Lobster.

879
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,120
I do wanna do this.

880
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,960
I have been to Red Lobster.

881
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,360
So have you looked at the menu?

882
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,080
Highly craveable.

883
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,120
Yeah, great, cheddar bay biscuits, we love those.

884
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,960
But like, if you look at the menu-

885
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,560
I am the one who must open the shrimp vortex every year.

886
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,960
They're named English shrimp.

887
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,400
Okay, see, no, that's shrimp.

888
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,240
You just said shrimp.

889
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,680
I just slit my, well, I create.

890
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,800
Yes, they're crispy and broiled shrimp.

891
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,960
The amazing miracle food that comes from the vortex.

892
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,680
Every year during Endless Shrimp,

893
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,120
I must slice open my palm

894
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,440
and let three drops of my blood fall onto the tablet.

895
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,280
Yeah, we know.

896
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,800
And then the Endless Shrimp vortex can open.

897
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,640
It's a merit-

898
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,320
It says it on every menu.

899
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,880
Skip this. We know.

900
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,880
Yeah, skip dialogue, next, we know.

901
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,800
Okay, so the miracle is that this food,

902
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
this miraculous food of shrimp,

903
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,520
comes from the vortex, completely prepared.

904
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,360
No.

905
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,120
No discernible source.

906
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,960
No.

907
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,800
No, no, no.

908
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Shrimp lives in water for the most part.

909
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,160
And so they are a type of fish, technically speaking.

910
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,000
They don't look-

911
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I don't want you to look at a shrimp and be like,

912
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,040
that's what a fish looks like.

913
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,560
Because honestly, I would say they are kind of the exception

914
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,360
to the rule.

915
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,400
Most shrimps aren't,

916
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,840
most fish aren't like sort of curvy like that.

917
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,720
Travis?

918
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,880
Yeah?

919
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, you're Travis Griffin.

920
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,640
Yeah.

921
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,800
Oh, are you telling me,

922
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,280
are you telling me they have souls?

923
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,600
If they have souls, then I am surely damned.

924
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,640
There is no god on any plane

925
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,040
that would forgive the number of shrimp

926
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,880
that I have summoned from the vortex

927
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,280
if they possess souls.

928
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,080
Let me comfort you there, Count Donut.

929
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,160
There is no-

930
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,840
There's no fucking way shrimps got souls.

931
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,680
Yeah, there's no way.

932
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,360
They barely, you know,

933
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,080
they're like, the fact that they move

934
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,000
is all that separates them from like a carrot, you know?

935
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,960
You're telling me shrimp don't have souls?

936
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,800
No way.

937
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,760
Then how do they reach shrimp heaven?

938
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,720
Thanks, everybody.

939
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,960
I really appreciate you listening to our podcast.

940
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,800
What?

941
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,640
Whoa, Chad.

942
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,640
My brother and me, it was all building to this.

943
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,120
The prestige is that I turned down my hood

944
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,600
and transformed back into your brother, Justin.

945
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,800
And I hope you had a really instructive time.

946
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,920
Make the mouth hole donut go the fuck away, please.

947
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,080
Oh, I'm so sorry.

948
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:33,920
I'm so sorry.

949
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,320
It is, there is something about the placement of the eyes

950
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
that did make that look like it was screaming, right?

951
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,160
Yeah.

952
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

953
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,400
What if you don't take the teeth out?

954
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,720
That seems like a big risk, actually.

955
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,880
Anyway, thanks so much for listening to our podcast,

956
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,280
my brother, my brother, and me.

957
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,120
We hope you're ha-

958
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,080
I hope Travis is having a good time.

959
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,920
Oh, I'm sure I am.

960
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,120
I'm in a castle.

961
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,040
That's my natural habitat.

962
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,880
And I hope that you will come see our shows

963
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,120
if you would like to do that.

964
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,680
Travis, please help.

965
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,240
Yes, so we have rescheduled dates

966
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,080
for our San Jose and Denver shows,

967
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,000
which we're very excited about.

968
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,080
April 27th, San Jose, California,

969
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,960
Adventure Zone with Aabria Iyengar.

970
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,560
Then we have San Jose, My Brother, My Brother, and Me

971
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,880
on April 28th.

972
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,240
My Brother, My Brother, and Me in Denver on April 29th.

973
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,440
So get those tickets.

974
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,560
And if you already have them,

975
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,680
all existing tickets for rescheduled shows

976
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,240
will be honored for the new dates.

977
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,640

Go check out all the great merch over at McElroyMerch.com.

990
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,240
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

991
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,840
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

992
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,960
My Life Is Better With You.

993
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,440
Montaigne, they are currently on tour now.

994
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,920
Shredding Australia saw a clip of Montaigne

995
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,480
playing our theme song on a stage

996
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,600
and people bouncing to it.

997
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,920
It was very life affirming.

998
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,520
So thank you, thank you for that.

999
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,440
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1000
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,520
It's a good time.

1001
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,640
We're having a great time over here.

1002
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,320
And then that's it for the show.

1003
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,160
All right.

1004
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,200
Happy Halloween.

1005
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,040
Yeah, happy Halloween.

1006
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,880
I don't even think my Halloween present to you

1007
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,920
is that I'm gonna let you have the final bit

1008
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,600
and you just kind of say like an inspirational,

1009
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,480
but in this case, it could also be like spooky,

1010
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,320
not scary, but spooky.

1011
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,160
Okay.

1012
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Okay, here it comes.

1013
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,200
So, when light,

1014
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,880
I had to gin up a whole mummy's maze

1015
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,920
Whoa, that wasn't prepared?

1016
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,120
No, of course it wasn't fucking prepared, Travis.

1017
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,120
Did you not hear that?

1018
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,120
Sometimes I use this like tone of voice

1019
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,120
that's like, kind of like he's doing his not smart voice.

1020
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,800
And that's me like, just sort of trying to buy myself time.

1021
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,800
But, and now you guys are having me do an additional thing

1022
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,120
at the end of the episode on top of the mummy's maze.

1023
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,360
That was like 10 minutes of good content.

1024
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,400
So when you guys do this to me,

1025
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,320
you're basically saying like, hey Griffin,

1026
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,840
we know that you've been doing most of the content

1027
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,160
this episode.

1028
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,600
Justin, hey Justin was Count Donut for like 25 minutes.

1029
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,320
That was good, but I feel like we helped you.

1030
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,400
I feel like we helped with Count Donut.

1031
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,080
Okay, I want to actually suggest this.

1032
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,280
Oh yeah, go ahead.

1033
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,680
We should do an impromptu who did the least.

1034
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,640
Oh, okay.

1035
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,680
At the end of each episode,

1036
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,240
we should actually, instead of put it on Griffin every time,

1037
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,600
just decide who did the least.

1038
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,440
Who did the least.

1039
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,560
Well, for my own personal reasons,

1040
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,480
which I don't need to go into,

1041
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,000
I'm not wild about that idea.

1042
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,880
It's not important why.

1043
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,880
Okay, I will close it out this time

1044
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,880
and just say that you can always go trick or treat,

1045
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,600
no matter how old you are,

1046
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,040
if you got a costume.

1047
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,120
If the people are home or not.

1048
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,680
No, you should, but do it all by rules and laws,

1049
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,080
but you can always trick or treat.

1050
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,680
How successful it will be, I don't know.

1051
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,840
But you can always do it,

1052
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,800
unless it's like a gated community where the HOA is like,

1053
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,520
please, come on, can we not?

1054
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,640
But that's my inspirational thing.

1055
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,280
You can always trick or treat.

1056
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,240
Okay, it's more of an observation.

1057
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,560
My name is Justin McElroy.

1058
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

1059
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1060
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,640
This has been my brother, my brother, me,

1061
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,760
kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1062
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,760
It's better with you, my life, oh, it's better,

1063
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,280
it's better with you, my life, oh, it's better,

1064
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:05,280
it's better, it's better with you, this is true, oh, it's better,

1065
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:29,280
it's better, it's better with you, my life, oh, it's better with you.
