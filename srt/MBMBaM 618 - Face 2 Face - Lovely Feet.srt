1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:19,120
Travis claims he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,760
Also this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,040
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,400
What's up, you cool babies?

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,040
It's better, it's better with you.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,040
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

8
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,040
This is true, it's better, it's better with you.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,040
My life, it's better with you.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me to my show for the modern era.

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:33,040
I'm your oldest brother, Dustin McElroy!

12
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:42,040
And I am Travis the Middle-est.

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
I don't need it, I already had you.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I already had you in the opener, I don't need it, I'm Griffin.

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I don't need it, I already had it.

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Mm, yum yum, secondsies.

17
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Second breakfast, yum yum.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I know, I hate to embarrass him, but Alan, is Alan here?

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
You gotta be more specific than that, it is not-

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
No, Alan, he was my Uber driver, I told him I'd put him on the list.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,040
He drove me from the airport, Alan.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Alan, my Uber driver, he said he definitely-

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
You drive for Uber?

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Your name is Alan?

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
No no no, I'm sorry, Lyft.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Alan from Lyft?

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
That was a confusion.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Can you imagine Alan was sitting there like, oh, but I was Lyft.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Alan, I put him on the list.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Did he say, I'll be sure to make it?

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
He said, I will definitely try to make it.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Oh, what's that, Justin, your family's not traveling with you this time?

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I'll be there, don't worry.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Yeah, I'll be there to support you.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll be your family.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Alan.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Oh man, Alan?

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
He says his own name like a Pokemon.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,040
It might have been Alon, A-L-A-N, Alan.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
I mean, any form of that.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Alan, if you drove me in your car.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Alan?

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Is there an Alan here?

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Alan?

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Hey, middle name, middle name Alan.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
What's up, Alan?

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Hey, a little shaky ride today, please.

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Thank you, Alan.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,040
If you could try to not take those turns quite so tight.

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Thank you.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Sorry to put you on blast.

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,040
I actually did meet a fellow at the Atlanta airport today.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Hey, what's going on?

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
What?

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
He did come, and I saw him, and he was like, hey, are you Justin Smacker?

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
I was like, yes, I am.

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
We exchanged blood and truths, and he said, I'm going to St. Louis.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
I said, me too.

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I said, you should go to the show.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
He said, yeah, I should.

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,040
And before he could say anything else, I said, I'll leave you a free ticket.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,040
And then as I was walking up the stairs, I thought, why did I do that?

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I should have made him buy a ticket.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Why did I give him a free ticket?

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
You took money out of our pockets with that.

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Yeah, that was rude of me.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
It was rude.

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm glad you could make it, though.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,040
So this is an advice show.

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
But this is a last bit, I promise.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
This is the last bit for the evening, I promise.

72
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
No more bits for the rest of the evening.

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Is anybody here in town for what is called Shutterfest that just happened to also realize there's...

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,040
There's a photography convention happening at our hotel where we live and sleep and eat

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:23,040
and walk through the hallway in our pajama pants like a Bigfoot on a Sunday afternoon.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,040
And the number of times I have just lumbered through a door into like a wedding shoot

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
or a boudoir session in the middle of a hotel hallway.

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
The boudoir sessions are wild.

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
There is a restaurant like 10 feet.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm just trying to go eat some buffalo chicken sandwich.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
And there's a boudoir shoot.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
You have boudoirs.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,040
It's a hotel, buddy, a boudoir.

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Before I knew that the thing was going on, when we first got to the hotel,

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
we came up and we got out of the elevator and I'm pushing a stroller

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
and I've just gotten off an airplane and I feel like a big piece of crud.

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
And right as we open the door to like try to squeeze our stroller through,

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
there just appears to be a goddess just like standing.

90
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,040
And I was like, oh, hi, hey.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
And she just goes, oh, you can go.

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
I was like, okay.

93
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Let me just round you.

94
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Thank you for this blessing on this thing.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Thank you.

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Thank you.

97
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
What should I do now, man?

98
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Okay, so we asked you, the people of St. Louis, for questions that we could help with.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Holy shit.

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Y'all sending a lot of stuff.

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,040
This is either like very participatory, which I love,

102
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,040
but you also have a lot of problems.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,040
A lot of socially uncomfortable slash awkward stuff happens in St. Louis, it seems.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Yeah, a lot of people need our...

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
St. Louis, you need help?

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Oh, thank you for asking.

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
The original name of the film was Meet Me in St. Louis, if it's convenient.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I mean, if you're already going to St. Louis, it would be cool to hook up,

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
but it's fine if you're busy.

110
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
And once you're there, we have some stuff to talk about.

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
We got to shoot some real shit.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
So here, let's get into it.

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Okay, please.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Oh, wait a minute.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,040
It occurs to me that we've been off the road for two years,

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,040
so I can say now that much like the Chilean miners,

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,040
we have reemerged from the depths of the earth

118
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
to appear before you here in St. Louis.

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Now we can begin the show in earnest.

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I celebrated my five-year wedding anniversary in November.

121
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Not Justin.

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I didn't.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
This is someone here.

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Don't cheer for them.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
They're not up here.

126
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
They're not up here.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Who's that?

128
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,040
This is important to the story because I found the thank you notes

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I wrote for my wedding gifts in my garage when I moved earlier this year.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:52,040
They are all, get this, written, sealed, addressed, and even include postage.

131
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Somehow I just forgot the last step, sending them.

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
The easiest step, one might say.

133
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
The most satisfying one.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
What's better than that?

135
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Literally the only step someone else does for you.

136
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
You hand them off to a government worker who takes them away

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
and takes care of them for you.

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,040
They took hours to write, and I want to get credit for all of that work,

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,040
but I also don't want to remind my judgy family

140
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
that they never did get those thank you notes.

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I bet they've been talking about it behind my back this whole time.

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
They have.

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Brothers, do I send these old super out-of-date notes anyway,

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,040
or should I cut my losses and toss them, hoping no one remembers by now?

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Everyone remembers.

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Everyone remembers.

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
They'll never forget.

148
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
It's the worst thing that's ever happened.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
That's from losing some laurels in Lake St. Louis.

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Are you here?

151
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
All right.

152
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Now, it is possible that the family has forgotten,

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
but they've only forgotten on the surface level,

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,040
and then deep in their subconscious, when they think about you,

155
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
they're like, no, I don't like them.

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I don't know why.

157
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
And I don't enjoy them.

158
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm going to save you a lot of time.

159
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
I can actually fix this one pretty easily.

160
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Okay, great.

161
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Get on internet.

162
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Go to the stamp place where you get rubber stamps.

163
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Not stamp stamps, rubber stamps.

164
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
That's confusing when it comes to envelopes.

165
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
That's why I clarified.

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Get a rubber stamp that says Post Office Error,

167
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,040
and then stamp it on every single one.

168
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Just stamp it.

169
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
This is doable.

170
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
This is doable and practical.

171
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
This is foolproof.

172
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
One question, though.

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,040
What agency will then deliver those for real?

174
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I had not thought about that.

175
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Okay.

176
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,040
And also, Justin, in this rich fiction you've created,

177
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
the Post Office is also like, oh, man, we fucked up.

178
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Get the stamp.

179
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Let them know we fucked up.

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
The whoopsie stamp.

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Why not just dip it?

182
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Unless there's a second government agency that just looks over

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
what the Post Office does and goes, oh, they fucked up again.

184
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,040
I think that's what the Postmaster General does, I'm pretty sure.

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I'd love to hear what else you think the Postmaster General does.

186
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Well, when people come to wage war on the Post Office,

187
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
he commands the troops.

188
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Also, he's in charge of the court marshals.

189
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Right.

190
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,040
You could also dip it in old coffee and then dry that out

191
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
and, like, burn the edges like an old treasure map.

192
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
And I don't know what the story is there,

193
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
but people will receive it and be like,

194
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
look at this busted-ass old mail I got.

195
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
But, like, you need a postmark from, like, Borneo or something.

197
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Apparently, get that at the same place you got this number stamp

198
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
that says Post Office there.

199
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Just stamp that on there like, oh, they must have sent it to Borneo.

200
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Yeah.

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Another Post Office error.

202
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Yeah.

203
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Right.

204
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Thanks for the free mail, hashtag pirates.

205
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Yeah.

206
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
I don't know why they would put a hashtag.

207
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
A dash would have made more sense.

208
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Well, they're trying to build up their S.E.O.

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Right.

210
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Can you just handwrite a little note then that says, like,

211
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
sorry, Post Office Greg.

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Like, sorry, says Post Office Greg.

213
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
My fault.

215
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
My fault.

216
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Please don't tell the general.

217
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Oh, what about this?

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
You're going to need to travel a lot for this,

219
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
but go to each of their houses individually,

220
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
slip it somewhere in the house, and then be like,

221
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
you got that letter, right?

222
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
And they're like, no, I never got it.

223
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
And they're like, are you sure?

224
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Check around.

225
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Maybe under that book.

226
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,040
You are going to go to all of their houses individually?

227
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Yeah.

228
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
You're going to invite yourself over for no reason at all?

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Yeah.

230
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
And then they'll be like, who is this?

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I actually don't like you.

232
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I don't remember why.

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm pretty sure Travis is suggesting a reverse burglary.

234
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Yeah.

235
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Right.

236
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
You could also just throw it in the window tied to a brick.

237
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
And they'll be like, what the fuck?

238
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Oh, it is the thank you note.

239
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
I have been waiting on that.

240
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Just drive by and chuck it into their lawn

241
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
or behind some ferns or something.

242
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Really?

243
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Let me help you look for it.

244
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Yeah.

245
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Tear it up a little bit.

246
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Why is that better than what I said?

247
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
What?

248
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Because yours is inside the house.

249
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Fair enough.

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Fair enough.

251
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
You can tear it up a little bit and put it in a dog house.

252
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
And then it's a dog's fault.

253
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
That's good.

254
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Dogs love that, to eat mail.

255
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
It wasn't me, I swear.

256
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Why do you think they attack postal service workers?

257
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Is it because they want access to that delicious mail?

258
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
They're the ones waging war on the post office.

259
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
The postmaster general fights the dogs.

260
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
It's science.

261
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Look it up.

262
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Read a history book.

263
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
How about another question?

264
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I would adore that.

265
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Who?

266
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
What?

267
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I want it.

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I want it so bad.

269
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Okay.

270
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
The other day some pals...

271
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Just a t-shirt, huh?

272
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Does she...

273
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Just a t-shirt?

274
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,040
The other day some pals and I were watching TV...

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I don't know where you get a suit.

276
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
You're in 35!

277
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Is it still the Macy's clearance rack?

278
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I went to Skeffington's in Huntington.

279
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
You can just do that.

280
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Did you expect?

281
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
You know Skeffington's?

282
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Some Skeffings in the house!

283
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Real Skeffheads!

284
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Their slogan is, when you're too far from being a menswear, come to Skeffington's.

285
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Because those are the two stores that you can do a tuxedo in Huntington.

286
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
So I went and when I walked in the door she said,

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Are you here to get something for the prom?

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Huh.

289
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Am I here to get...

290
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
You see me, right?

291
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Am I here to get something for the prom?

292
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,040
No, I'm a 41 year old man.

293
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
No, I'm not here to get something for the prom.

294
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
So they hooked me up with this.

295
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
You look like a million bucks.

296
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Yeah, I asked for tails.

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
They didn't have them.

298
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Next time maybe.

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Okay.

300
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
The other day some pals and I were watching TV at my friend's house.

301
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
One of my friends left to use the bathroom.

302
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,040
And a minute later I felt someone lean over behind me and whisper,

303
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
What are you watching?

304
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Assuming it was a friend, I put them in a one-armed headlock without looking back.

305
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:05,040
After a moment of dead silence, I looked back to see I was holding my friend's dad by the neck.

306
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I apologize profusely, but I can't...

307
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Why?

308
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
But I can't help...

309
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
You did the right...

310
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Correct.

311
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
But I did...

312
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
But I can't help but feel like I have screwed up irreparably.

313
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Brothers, what can I do to repair this relationship?

314
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,040
I go to their house all the time and I want to be able to look in this man's eyes without dying of shame.

315
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,040
That's from Strangling in St. Louis.

316
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Are you...

317
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Are you here?

318
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
You did nothing wrong.

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Yeah.

320
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Hey, listen, real quick PSA.

321
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,040
If you're sitting behind that person,

322
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
keep the whispering to a minimum because apparently they're headlock happy.

323
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Just lean forward and just go,

324
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Werenbergs.

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Don't do that.

326
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Don't do that.

327
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,040
I also, and this is not a criticism of the two question askers so far,

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
if anything, I'm so delighted by it because, you know,

329
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
it's been a while since you all have been to a live event.

330
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,040
But the screams of acknowledgement have been so anguished.

331
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Well, it's when you hear your problem said out loud in front of a lot of people.

332
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, that's a fair point.

333
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
What have I done?

334
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,040
I also have not been asked to scream in a large crowd in a while.

335
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,040
I don't know what would come out of me if the moment came.

336
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Okay, we do need to clarify.

337
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,040
We're going to get to the advice in just a second.

338
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,040
What were you watching?

339
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Our Flag Means Death.

340
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Our Flag Means Death.

341
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Excellent choice.

342
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Okay.

343
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Excellent choice.

344
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Been enjoying that lately myself.

345
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
That's not relevant.

346
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
It's just a good show.

347
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:49,040
The father of your friend needs to figure out how to look in your eyes without dying of shame.

348
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Because you got him.

349
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
You got him so fucking good.

350
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
You got him.

351
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
He was sneaking up on you trying to get all up in your business.

352
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Got him.

353
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
You got him.

354
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,040
That moment of silence that you thought was awkward because you got someone in a headlong

355
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
was actually awkward because he was thinking, oh, that got me.

356
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
It got me good.

357
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
I have been gotten.

358
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
That moment of like, I'm going to lean forward and ask them what they're watching.

359
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
I don't want to scare them.

360
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
I'm going to ask you to quietly grab.

361
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Oh, man, I fucked up.

362
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Is exactly what they were thinking.

363
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I guarantee it.

364
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
If anything, you've done him a service because he needs to know that that is not acceptable

365
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
under any situation.

366
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,040
To lean close enough to be able to grab someone in a war, that's right here.

367
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah.

368
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
That's here.

369
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,040
If you're in the combat zone, you will receive combat.

370
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,040
That only is okay if you're the parrot that lives on my shoulder asking me what I'm watching.

371
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,040
That's the only time that's acceptable, and I'm still going to get that guy in a headlock.

372
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I am so appreciative you came tonight.

373
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
I was thinking about pirates.

374
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Yeah, sure.

375
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm so appreciative you came tonight and for your patronage.

376
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I would suggest humbly, it may be time to revisit your headlock policy in general.

377
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Just broadly speaking, there is a very different version of this question.

378
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,040
It's like, I just asked my friend what they were watching, and they put me in a headlock.

379
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Is that okay?

380
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Is that normal?

381
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,040
There is a wide gulf, Justin, between, hey, what are you watching over there?

382
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
What are you watching?

383
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Yeah, see, I wanted to do it.

384
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
You see?

385
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
He almost did it.

386
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
There is also a different scenario in which you uppercutted your friend's den, and instead,

387
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
it was just the one on our headlock.

388
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
So, I think you got off easy, and so did he.

389
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Yeah.

390
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Was it a particularly raunchy, erotic scene of Our Flag Means Death that you were like,

391
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:43,040
kind of like, you got caught watching something that had like a, you know, a breast or...

392
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Have you watched the show?

393
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
No.

394
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,040
You're saying it doesn't rock like that?

395
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Not as a rule, no.

396
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,040
It's more subtextual.

397
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Okay, all right.

398
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Well, that's a shame, right?

399
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
What is this?

401
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,040
So, this is my new guy.

402
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,040
In the two-year break, I've been working on this new guy.

403
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Tell me all about him.

404
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
I'm obsessed.

405
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Well, you know what he's into, so I don't know what else there is to say about him.

406
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Hey, can we talk to the wizard for a moment?

407
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Sure.

408
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Mighty Throne.

409
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Paul, can I have some white wine components?

410
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Thank you.

411
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
And may I have my other can?

412
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Thank you.

413
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Do mine first, Paul.

414
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
It's not a race, Paul.

415
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
I don't need mine, Paul.

416
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm drinking responsibly, like it says right here on the can.

417
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,040
You didn't see him backstage.

418
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Don't applaud for him.

419
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
He's an animal.

420
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Thank you, Paul.

421
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Thank you.

422
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
No, no, no.

423
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Please, thank you.

424
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Watch what Justin does.

425
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
One sec.

426
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Oh, rip that shit.

427
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
That is the sound of comedy.

428
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Now, if you've been watching Justin swirl his drink, just know that this is what he's been swirling.

429
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
They know.

430
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
They know how we do it.

431
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
It's to avoid the stratification.

432
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
White Claw and Red Wine want to stay.

433
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
It's on white.

434
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
You just leave the can.

435
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Thank you.

436
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Can I keep the can?

437
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Thank you.

438
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Red Wine and White Claw like to naturally separate.

439
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Yeah.

440
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
So he has to keep them.

441
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
That's fine because you can float quarks.

442
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Sorry to interrupt, but while we're at a stopping point, because Rachel has long since pressed pause on the recording.

443
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Bradley, are you here?

444
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Make a noise.

445
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Cool.

446
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,040
I totally have your debit card.

447
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Okay, wait.

448
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
And you'll have to fight him.

449
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Hey, Bradley.

450
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Wait, wait, stop.

451
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Everyone be quiet.

452
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Everyone be quiet.

453
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Bradley, can you woo again with the knowledge that has been important to you, please?

454
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
That's good.

455
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
That's right.

456
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Bradley, just for future reference, if you're in an event like this and someone asks you to make a noise, you have no clue what's about to come.

457
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Timber is like, yes.

458
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Yeah.

459
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Because it could be like your card just flipped over.

460
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Let's also be clear how I phrased that.

461
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I didn't say I need to give you your debit card.

462
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I said, I totally have your debit card.

463
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
He's bragging, if anything.

464
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
I mean, that sounds like the beginning of Blackmail to me.

465
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Seriously though, just come like down to the stage once the show's done and show me some ID.

466
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,040
With your head hung in shame.

467
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Bradley, did you think Paul was going to be like, hey, good news, you won $1,000?

468
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
The adoption papers came through.

469
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
You're my son.

470
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
You're my son now.

471
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I've adopted you.

472
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Paul and Stormin Bradley.

473
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
So a lot of people sent this one in.

474
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,040
And I feel especially equipped to try and answer this given the photography convention that I've kind of attended.

475
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Yeah.

476
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
So thank you, everybody who sent it in.

477
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
It was co-authored.

478
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh, it has a name on it.

479
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Tracy Halverson.

480
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Are you here?

481
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Probably not.

482
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Who is a modeling agent.

483
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Okay, so this is going to be a lot of good info because it is how to be a foot model.

484
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Are you all going to be fucking weird about this whole thing?

485
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Because I can stop right now.

486
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
We are grown-ups.

487
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
They're just feet, people.

488
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Foot modeling.

489
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
The type of parts modeling.

490
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
An important part of fashion modeling.

491
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
It's not parts modeling.

492
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
That's not what you said.

493
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
A type of parts modeling.

494
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Oh, that can't be it.

495
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Remodel the parts.

496
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Okay, this is the whole sentence.

497
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Foot modeling.

498
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
A type of parts modeling.

499
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
An important part of fashion modeling.

500
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Period.

501
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Many large designer shoe companies require foot models for their advertisements.

502
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
If you have...

503
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,040
One more time, please.

504
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
If you have...

505
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,040
That was Urchin.

506
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
One more time, please.

507
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
If you have lovely feet.

508
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Okay.

509
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Now, I don't want to yuck anyone's.

510
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Young people do have lovely feet.

511
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Sure.

512
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Name them.

513
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I am submitting a formal request to the government that you do not name them.

514
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
It's been denied.

515
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm sorry.

516
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
The postmaster general said no.

517
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
He needs to hear this too.

518
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
If you have lovely feet, you might...

519
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
This sounds like...

520
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I'll get through this sentence.

521
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I swear to God.

522
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,040
But it does sound like the start or maybe the end of a lawyer commercial that's like,

523
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,040
if you have lovely feet, you may be entitled to...

524
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,040
If you have either mesothelioma or lovely feet.

525
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Or lovely feet.

526
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Or both.

527
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
They're not mutually exclusive.

528
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,040
My mesothelioma gave me lovely feet.

529
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I wouldn't change a thing.

530
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Worth it.

531
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,040
If you have lovely feet.

532
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
If you have lovely feet.

533
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:55,040
And mesothelioma.

534
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
If you have lovely feet.

535
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Come on, man.

536
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
You can do it.

537
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Everyone believe hard enough.

538
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I just got to fucking ramp it.

539
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
If you have lovely feet, you might be able to make extra money or even an entire career

540
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
as a foot model.

541
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Here we go.

542
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh, there's a lot of cartoon feet happening on this page now.

543
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Any SpongeBob's?

544
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Yeah, a lot of good ones, SpongeBob's.

545
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Practice using your feet to articulate emotion.

546
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Huh.

547
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Huh.

548
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Sadder.

549
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Many of the most sought after feet models have more than just beautiful feet.

550
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm assuming they meant lovely feet.

551
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,040
They know how to use their feet to evoke emotion during a photo or video shoot to help sell

552
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
a product.

553
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Your feet may have to look like they've just been tickled or your, or your curled toes

554
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,040
might need to convey excitement.

555
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Practice striking poses with your feet in the mirror and quickly changing between different

556
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
foot positions.

557
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
On the set of a photo shoot, you want to be able to immediately follow the instructions

558
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
you're given about how your feet should look.

559
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Curl your toes in ecstasy.

560
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Holy shit.

561
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
That was so fast.

562
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
They're the one, smut.

563
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Create a portfolio.

564
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Smile with your foot, smut.

565
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
No, that's smankeling.

566
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
You're smankeling right now.

567
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
No, that's smose.

568
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,040
You're smiling with your toes, smut.

569
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
You're smooching your boots right now.

570
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
That's not right.

571
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Create a portfolio of your feet.

572
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,040
This will help you to find modeling jobs and have pictures on hand when you need them.

573
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Someone in the audience is trying to cover the fact that they're taking hasty notes right

574
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
now.

575
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Yeah, I got that.

576
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I got the portfolio of my feet.

577
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,040
You can keep this portfolio organized online in a website or even on Instagram.

578
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Password protected, if you may.

579
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
No.

580
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Include an about me page or a list of your work, history, and modeling.

581
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Make sure you have pictures from different angles and various styles of lighting with,

582
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm assuming, different emotions expressed by each individual foot.

583
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Don't confuse those.

584
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Man, I hate to see a sad foot with happy lighting, right?

585
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Because I'm like, what could possibly be happening here?

586
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Look at that lighting.

587
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Get it together, foot.

588
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
This one's easy.

589
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Sign with a modeling agency in your area.

590
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Yeah.

591
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,040
In my area, it's Skeffington's, weirdly enough.

592
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,040
You can sign with multiple modeling agencies there, hot feet, to book more jobs when you

593
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
are first beginning.

594
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Sometimes there are specific agencies for body part models, like foot models.

595
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Here's the deal.

596
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
We only do middle toe and pinky toe.

597
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,040
That's our department.

598
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Any other toes, you go down the street.

599
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Throw up the horns.

600
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
No, not like that.

601
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
No.

602
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
The downtown horns.

603
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Oh, sorry.

604
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You're looking for happy toes?

605
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
That's next door.

606
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
That's next door.

607
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
It's for children.

608
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
We only rep adult models.

609
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Tasteful, discreet, adult foot models.

610
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Can you really sign with multiple modeling agencies at the same time?

611
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
I don't think that is right.

612
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I don't think it's right.

613
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
One gets the right foot, one gets the left foot.

614
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,040
But what if any of us are competing shoots on the same day?

615
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
This one's name is Jersey Dave.

616
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
He's the bad boy of my feet.

617
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
He does a lot of S&M and leather stuff.

618
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
And over here, this is Daisy.

619
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,040
She's the good foot.

620
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Sorry, I thought Jersey Dave was a sandwich shop.

621
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Jersey Mike's.

622
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
It can be both.

623
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay.

624
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Why can't a foot open a sandwich store?

625
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
And this is my foot.

626
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
It's a sandwich.

627
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
What?

628
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Consider moving to a city with a large advertisement market.

629
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,040
It doesn't say or also with a lot of feet, folks.

630
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,040
You'd love to think you could do it all from home.

631
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I get that with the Zoom and everything.

632
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,040
But you really got to go where the money is, where the foot money is.

633
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
How is the foot money not on the internet?

634
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,040
How is the foot money not on the internet?

635
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
A sentence?

636
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Well, I thought I actually would say, I'm not surprised that I said that in my life.

637
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
You've definitely said, I think all of us have said that sentence out loud at some point

638
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
with the exact tone of voice that you said it.

639
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,040
This says, for example, Parts Models, located in New York, is one of the largest body parts

640
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
modeling agencies in the country.

641
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
So wait a second.

642
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Because I feel like that sentence needed a comma in it somewhere.

643
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,040
We got the biggest feet here at Parts Models.

644
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,040
The more you say it, the more it sounds like some Dexter-ass shit, right?

645
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh, we model body parts.

646
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
You mean like on people, right?

647
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Yeah!

648
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Well, how much you got?

649
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
This is where the article really betrays itself.

650
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Accept other types of modeling jobs.

651
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,040
When you're beginning your modeling career, you may want to diversify the types of modeling

652
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
positions to seek out your consistent work.

653
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
The rest of my body is fucking gross, but my feet...

654
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Oh, my feet.

655
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,040
What's great is in the ad sidebar right next to that was a picture of Buzz Lightyear.

656
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Just kidding, they're very brown.

657
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
What are you talking about?

658
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
What's going on over on this article?

659
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Mmm.

660
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Determine what type of foot model you want to be.

661
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
In all sectors of modeling, you can be either a fashion model or a fit model.

662
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,040
A fit model works directly with designers to make sure that the shoes fit to size and look good.

663
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Fashion models work on advertisements and photo spreads with companies and designers.

664
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
That's me.

665
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Oh, no, I pivoted into learning.

666
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Sorry, Justin.

667
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Okay, here, we'll move on to caring for your feet.

668
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Exfoliate that shit.

669
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Yes!

670
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Oh, man, actually just say...

671
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Actually just moisturize that shit.

672
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm going to speed through these.

673
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Exercise that shit.

674
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Rub your feet or have them massaged regularly to keep the circulation good.

675
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You should be doing that anyway.

676
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
You know, we're comfortable in protective shoes.

677
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
As a foot model, your feet are your source of income.

678
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,040
In your daily, everyday life, you want to do everything you can to keep them free of strain or marks?

679
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Yeah, I guess if you kick a rock the wrong way.

680
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,040
But I like to think if you're a foot model, you wouldn't be taking chances like that with a devil-maker attitude.

681
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
If you're the bad boy of foot modeling, like me...

682
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Yes!

683
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,040
I want to buy shoes from a foot model where the feet have, like, been through some shit.

684
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Yeah, their character.

685
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,040
They're like cowboy feet that are all fucked up.

686
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Yeah!

687
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Like a horse kicked this foot.

688
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Yeah!

689
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
The open range.

690
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
A real American foot.

691
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Yeah.

692
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Lost a toe gangrene in the Adidara by my shoes.

693
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,040
The exact ones I was wearing at the time.

694
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Anyway, this segment got a lot grosser and judgier than I thought it would.

695
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
And so I'd like to apologize on both accounts.

696
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,040
When my boyfriend and I moved into our current rental, the toilet seats were super cheap.

697
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Plastic seats that allowed us to feel unsupported while on the throne.

698
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,040
What are toilet seats traditionally made out of?

699
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Chrome.

700
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,040
You know, it's just you can have a nice plastic.

701
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
You know, a nice, thick, durable plastic.

702
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Or like a marble.

703
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't think that.

704
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Just like a circular hibachi table.

705
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Mother of pearl inlay.

706
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Right.

707
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,040
So we purchased two new toilet seats that were a few steps up in quality.

708
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
About $25 each.

709
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Ooh la la.

710
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I asked the landlord if she wanted the original seats back.

711
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
We have no storage space.

712
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
And she said no.

713
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Flash forward to now.

714
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Wait, just real quick.

715
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
What else was the landlord?

716
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Do you want to hold on to these?

717
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Yeah, do you need these?

718
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
That someone has used.

719
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Flash forward to now.

720
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
We are moving in a few months to be closer to work.

721
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
My question is this.

722
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Do we have to leave our toilet seats since we trashed the original crappy ha ha seats?

723
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Back in there?

724
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Yeah.

725
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Pause for laughs.

726
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Continue to pause.

727
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,040
What about the toilets since we paid for them and leave the rental seatless?

728
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
That's from toilet seat stress in St. Louis.

729
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Scream like you're being tortured?

730
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Oh.

731
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Someone doesn't want friends coming over to use your incredible toilet seats.

732
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I respect it.

733
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I do.

734
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
My problem with taking the toilet seats.

735
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Just one.

736
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Main problem with taking the toilet seats.

737
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Is that it presupposes a reality in which you arrive at your new domicile and it has everything your heart could desire.

738
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Except toilet seats.

739
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,040
What are you going to do with your new spare toilet seats?

740
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
I think Travis and I can-

741
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Pay it back.

742
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Take those old toilet seats from the new place.

743
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Make them the new toilet seats of the old place.

744
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Wait.

745
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Stop.

746
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Absolutely cheer.

747
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Wait.

748
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Are you saying in your mind's eye that the new toilet seats at the new place are worse than the purchase?

749
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Because $25 is like good.

750
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
I don't know toilet seat prices.

751
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Hey, hold on.

752
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Can you do this bit standing up so everybody can see the tuxedo you're wearing so you can talk about fucking toilet seat quality?

753
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
And I want everyone-

754
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Hold on.

755
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I want everyone to just sort of think about the sort of putrid-

756
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Your fly is down too by the way.

757
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
It's extremely down.

758
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
No, fix that.

759
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I want everyone to just sort of think about the rotting corpse of late stage capitalism as Justin speaks about the $25 toilet seat and how they are unsatisfactory.

760
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Have you heard about this bidets?

761
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Now they got bidets.

762
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Thanks for giving it a drink.

763
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm just trying to poop over here.

764
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
It's pretty good.

765
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
This is not the character I thought it was going to be.

766
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Justin, say something about bidets and confused and see if you win them back.

767
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Um, imagine-

768
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Where is anybody even buying these things?

769
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Nice.

770
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Good start.

771
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Where is any-

772
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
It's so hot. Do you feel like it's so hot?

773
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Where is anybody even buying these?

774
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Talk about toilet seats?

775
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Probably Home Depot or Lowe's.

776
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Home Depot or Lowe's, one of the two.

777
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Where is- I wanted to leave the new-

778
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
The throne.

779
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Some throne this is.

780
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I think he's crying.

781
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
I think he is too.

782
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Some-

783
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Airplane food, huh?

784
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Yeah, that's right.

785
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Bring it home.

786
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
That's my time. Thanks.

787
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:09,040
We really didn't give you much to work with when we sent you out there and I am sorry for that.

788
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Come on. I'll be fine.

789
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
I just need a little red wine. I'll be fine.

790
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:25,040
There is no reality in which you can leave the next tenants of this place you have lived in for a while now zero toilet seats.

791
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:37,040
It runs the risk of starting a change reaction in which when you go to check out a new house or a new apartment people having to with a straight face ask the question, and do the toilet seats come with it?

792
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Do the toilet seats commute?

793
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Are they included?

794
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I think when you-

795
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
This is how they get you. Do we have to pay extra for the toilet seats?

796
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I've been around the block.

797
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I think once you make a capital improvement to a rental property you have to accept that as that sunk cost.

798
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
That money is gone.

799
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
It's like national parks rules.

800
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Leave it better than you found it.

801
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Don't take the toilet seats.

802
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Don't take the toilet seats. You're improving it.

803
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,040
If you had repainted you wouldn't lick the walls clean before you left.

804
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
What are you talking about?

805
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,040
I paid for it. I'm going to eat every drop.

806
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
It's my legal right.

807
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Is that what Willy Wonka did when he had to vacate the factory?

808
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Hey everybody lick the walls.

809
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
This just tastes like paint.

810
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah but keep going please.

811
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
That's what he didn't tell Charlie. It's all yours Charlie. All of this.

812
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm going to take the fucking toilet seats.

813
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
You think I'm just going to leave you the big room where everything is made out of candy?

814
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Do you think that was free Charlie?

815
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm taking the Oompa Loompas.

816
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
I hope you know how to make candy.

817
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
And the boat's a lease.

818
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
So...

819
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
So...

820
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
It's better with you.

821
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
It's better with you.

822
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
It's better with you.

823
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Hi everybody.

824
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,040
It's me your middle-ist and dare I say Travis brother.

825
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Travis McElroy.

826
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm here to tell you a little bit about I was going to say sponsors but maybe even friends this week.

827
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
First Bombas. Bombas' mission is simple.

828
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated.

829
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
So when you buy Bombas you're also given to someone in need.

830
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Bombas designs their socks, shirts, and underwears to be the clothes you can't wait to put on every day.

831
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Everything they make is soft, seamless, tagless, and has a cozy feel.

832
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
I very much vouch for that.

833
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,040
I am wearing Bombas socks and underpants as we speak.

834
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
It's wonderful.

835
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Bombas no-show socks are designed for comfort while being specially engineered to never fall down.

836
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,040
So let your ankles be free to soak up the sunlight my friends.

839
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Bombas dot com slash my brother.

840
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
And now we'll talk about Stitch Fix.

841
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Because what's that?

842
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm wearing over my Bombas underpants while it's my Stitch Fix clothes.

843
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Of course, whatever your style, now more than ever is the time to rock it.

844
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
That is absolutely true.

845
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
No truer words.

846
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
But maybe you can use just a little nudge to find some new looks.

847
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
That's where Stitch Fix can help you out.

848
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:31,040
I just got sent a Stitch Fix that contained a combination of clothes which I like to think of as a dad at beach wedding.

849
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
But like a cool dad, right?

850
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Like a dad who's watched every James Bond movie and actually took some style tips away from it.

851
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
That kind of thing, right?

852
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
So first, here's how Stitch Fix works.

853
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Take a few minutes to set up your Stitch Fix style profile.

854
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Answer a few questions about what you like to wear, what you don't, and how open you are to trying new styles.

855
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Then Stitch Fix's expert stylist will go to work finding items exclusively for you.

856
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Every piece is hand-picked for you and is unique to your style, size, and in your budget.

857
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
And they'll send you five pieces to try on at home.

858
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
You only keep what you love.

859
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
You send back what you don't.

860
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040

And finally, Babble.

866
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Right?

867
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
What's that?

868
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,040
I'm wearing Barbra's underpants, Stitch Fix pants, and what's that in my mouth?

869
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
It's Babble words.

870
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
There it is.

871
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Yeah.

872
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Right?

873
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I have a dream of someday when the kids are older, right, being able to go to France and

874
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,040
at the very least talk to people and not have them think that I am just an absolute, you

875
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
know, baby.

876
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,040
And so I've been working with Babble to try to learn some French.

877
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
And you know what?

878
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
It's fun.

879
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
It's easy.

880
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,040
And I actually think for once in my life I'm actually retaining some of the language I'm

881
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
learning.

882
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040

And now, back to the show.

914
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Hi, I'm Janet Varney.

915
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,040
And just like you, I survived high school.

916
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
And we're not alone.

917
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,040
On my podcast, The JV Club, I invite some of my friends to share the highs and lows

918
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
of their teen years, like moments with Aisha Tyler.

919
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,040
But when you're a kid, the stakes are just pretty low.

920
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Go to school, try not to get in trouble, get laid.

921
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Jamila Jamil.

922
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,040
I watched television probably every waking hour during that time when I was shitfaced on medicine.

923
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
And Dave Holmes.

924
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
We talked and talked, and then everybody left.

925
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
It was just us two, and I was like, I love you.

926
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Learn how you too can be a functioning adult after the drama and heartbreak of high school.

927
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Every week on The JV Club with Janet Varney.

928
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Find it on Maximum Fun.

929
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Or wherever you get your podcasts.

930
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
This is a judgment-free show.

931
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Hi, I'm Biz, host of One Bad Mother.

932
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Whether you're a parent or just know kids exist in the world,

933
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,040
join us each week as we honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

934
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,040
I signed my stepson up for a camp that is actually in another state.

935
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
I feel really stupid, and I don't think we're going to get the money back.

936
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,040
And then he found out that the car manual is a book about cars.

937
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
So now he's reading our car manual.

938
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,040
We are excited.

939
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

940
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
and remind you that you are doing a great job.

941
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Download One Bad Mother on MaximumFun.org.

942
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:39,040
And yes, there will be swears.

943
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:54,040
And then a different song.

944
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I want to munch.

945
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:03,040
I want to munch.

946
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Welcome to Munch Squad.

947
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,040
It is a podcast within a podcast.

948
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,040
We're profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

949
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
And we got a lot of excitement.

950
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,040
I don't know if you guys looked at the calendar, but it's 420, baby.

951
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
It's 420.

952
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
And I wanted to take a moment with you.

953
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
Wait, sorry.

954
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,040
What does 420 have to do with anything?

955
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
It's 420.

956
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Yeah.

957
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
And I wanted to take a moment with you to tell you about all the great

958
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,040
specials that are happening now in Earth about weed.

959
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
Oh.

960
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
Yeah, because it's weed day.

961
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Doghouse rolled out stony baloney items in honor of 420.

962
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
I swear to God, when you started this bit, I was like,

963
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
none of these are going to get me.

964
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
And the first one out the gate.

965
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
Stony baloney.

966
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Stony baloney items.

967
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
They're coming out for 420.

968
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:08,040
In honor of satisfy your munchies, the absolute worst way with

969
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Doghouse's new stony baloney.

970
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Don't look.

971
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Oh, it's worse.

972
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
W-U-R-S-T.

973
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
I thought there was like, this shit's terrible.

974
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
This shit sucks.

975
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Our joke sucks.

976
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
We suck.

977
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Please help us.

978
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,040
In honor of 420, the award-winning gourmet hot dog sausage and burger

979
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,040
concept, just say restaurant, is launching two dope menu items.

980
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
I get it.

981
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,040
It'll be available through, wait for it, May 31st.

982
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah, bro.

983
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,040
How about as a strength of your convictions?

984
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,040
That's cocaine day, bro.

985
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,040
These one-of-a-kind creations will turn any case of dry mouth into a

986
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
mouthwatering craven.

987
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
It doesn't matter what's on.

988
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,040
There is a stony baloney breakfast burrito, which is three, count them,

989
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,040
three sunny side up eggs with a beef patty, beef dog, chili, white American

990
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,040
cheese, cheese sauce, crispy tater tots, onion and spicy mayo in a flour

991
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
tortilla.

992
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Don't, ugh, if you're not high, friends.

993
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Does it cost $23?

994
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,040
And does it come with baloney in it?

995
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,040
In addition to the stony baloney menu items, Doghouse is offering its

996
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,040
2022 Mixologist collaboration cocktails.

997
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,040
The best part, for each purchase of the featured cocktails, Doghouse will

998
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,040
donate $1 to its national charity partner, No Kid Hungry.

999
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,040
A strange addition to this particular press release.

1000
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Listen, it's not all fun and games.

1001
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,040
At Doghouse, we take every opportunity we can to craft unique creations

1002
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
and 420 munchies were a great inspiration.

1003
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
Says cool dude.

1004
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,040
Says your dad.

1005
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,040
Says your dad, Chef Adam Gertler.

1006
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
We're offering these through May to make sure all our guests get a chance

1007
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
to try them.

1008
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
We look forward to hearing what everyone thinks about the items, all

1009
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
while giving back to a great cause.

1010
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,040
Where's the strength of your convictions?

1011
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,040
If you're doing one about weed, be more like Chiba Hub, which is a

1012
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
restaurant about weed that doesn't actually sell weed.

1013
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
It's so important.

1014
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
It's weed themed.

1015
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,040
Chiba Hut toasted subs.

1016
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Chiba Hut is offering plenty of deals to patrons to celebrate weed

1017
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
enthusiasts' favorite day of the year.

1018
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
Well, they just said it.

1019
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,040
They're offering, yes, Chiba has the strength of its convictions.

1020
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,040
That's what I'm saying.

1021
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
They don't do a wink and a nod.

1022
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,040
They're like, you like weed?

1023
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
We like making money.

1024
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
Here we go.

1025
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:48,040
They're offering $4.20 food and drink specials, giving out grinders

1026
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
and over a thousand rad prizes.

1027
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Rad prizes, you say?

1028
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Rad prizes, like free food for a year.

1029
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,040
Tubular.

1030
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,040
And a dream Colorado vacation, dude.

1031
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,040
It's all part of their 420 promotion with top shelf deals that go on for

1032
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
the entire month of April.

1033
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:16,040
The food special offers 420 nugs served on a special edition 2022 frisbees.

1034
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:25,040
You guys like this too, right?

1035
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,040
They had to be like, hey, do we have any sort of just weed stuff lying

1036
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,040
around?

1037
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Well, we got a bunch of frisbees from that summer promotion that failed

1038
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,040
back in 2003.

1039
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah.

1040
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Get those.

1041
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Waystoys love flinging that fruit.

1042
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,040
They can wash down their meal with either a delicious Pabst blue ribbon

1043
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,040
draft pour and a side shot of fireball.

1044
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
That's your day.

1045
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
That's your day.

1046
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:55,040
A side shot of fireball or two PBRs for the fitting price of 420 as well.

1047
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,040
This is another example of how we aren't your basic sub shop.

1048
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
We have awesome bars within our huts.

1049
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,040
We're not a cover for the government.

1050
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,040
We've teamed up.

1051
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,040
We've teamed up with some great partners this year, like Pabst and

1052
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,040
fireball.

1053
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
No, get out.

1054
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,040
In my experience, those two working together rarely leads to a satisfactory

1055
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
outcome.

1056
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,040
To bring our 21 plus crowd some insane drink specials and sweepstakes.

1057
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
And that's from Mel Bannister.

1058
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
I don't know if you all know.

1059
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,040
Mel, are you here?

1060
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Mel.

1061
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
That's not all.

1062
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,040
Each location is offering a special interactive grinder.

1063
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
What?

1064
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,040
What?

1065
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Each location is offering a special interactive grinder.

1066
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,040
I mean, I interact with most sandwiches that I get my hands on.

1067
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,040
It's an interactive grinder to the first hundred people to stop by on April 20th,

1068
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:01,040
which has a QR code that is scannable until July the 10th.

1069
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
To do what?

1070
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
To start an ARG?

1071
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,040
That can't be right.

1072
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,040
Is it?

1073
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Is it?

1074
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
Hey, honey.

1075
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,040
What are you going to throw in this wrapper room, Jeebus?

1076
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Okay, so that over two months.

1077
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,040
I'm getting around to it.

1078
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,040
I'm getting around.

1079
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,040
I'm going to scan that QR code here in the next three months.

1080
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
I was envisioning.

1081
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
I was envisioning.

1082
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
I didn't know it was on the wrapper.

1083
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Both are wild.

1084
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,040
I thought I was envisioning somebody like a sandwich artist having to like

1085
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,040
draw out the QR code with mustard on each.

1086
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
This means something.

1087
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,040
The grand prize is a vacation to Colorado for one person and a guest

1088
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
with flights and activities like whitewater rafting,

1089
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,040
horseback riding at the Garden of the Gods,

1090
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,040
and a cannabis tour included.

1091
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,040
Customers will also be getting hooked up with Willie's Reserve rolling papers.

1092
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,040
Every store will have its own special events going on,

1093
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
so be sure to stay plugged into your local Chibas.

1094
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,040
You can't just sneak in that you're distributing paraphernalia in there.

1095
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Like, yeah, what's up waste-oids?

1096
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,040
Do you want to come skateboard with me, a cool adult?

1097
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,040
Anyway, we will give you a big fucking bong and like half an ounce.

1098
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,040
Is that a lot?

1099
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
I don't know.

1100
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Do you think you have to take the rolling papers?

1101
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
I just wanted a sandwich, dude.

1102
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,040
I'm on my lunch break.

1103
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,040
I'm on my lunch break.

1104
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,040
Oh, come on, man.

1105
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
Scan the QR code.

1106
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
No.

1107
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
No.

1108
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
Give me until you have until July.

1109
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
I'm throwing this away now.

1110
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,040
Wait.

1111
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,040
So you want me to scan something and then register all my information into it

1112
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,040
as you hand me these rolling papers?

1113
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Totally cool.

1114
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,040
Just put your home address and previous criminal record, dude.

1115
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Got any ties?

1116
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
Any shady groups you should know about?

1117
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,040
Go ahead and put your thumb right on the screen, dog.

1118
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Del Taco's rolling out new iteration of 20 under $2 value menu and new poppers drinks.

1119
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,040
As inflation continues to skyrocket, prices on everything from gas...

1120
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Who cares?

1121
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,040
Tell me about the weed stuff.

1122
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,040
I mean, Del Taco doesn't really need to say,

1123
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,040
hey, weed friends, come and get it if you're high.

1124
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,040
I think people who are high are like, Del Taco, I'm sold.

1125
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,040
How do we get high people in here to eat our cheap tacos?

1126
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Guests looking to try the new chicken cheddar rollers are in for an additional treat.

1127
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,040
To celebrate the rollout, Del Taco's Del Yeah rewards members

1128
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:40,040
can get five chicken cheddar rollers for $4.20 on Wednesday, April 20th.

1129
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,040
And there's three asterisks there, I guess to stand in for eyebrow raising.

1130
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,040
Huh? Huh? Huh? Get it?

1131
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:55,040
For one day only on what Del Taco is calling Roller Days with a Z.

1132
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,040
Additionally, fans unable to pop into their local Del Taco restaurant

1133
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:07,040
for the one day only deal can access the offer and free delivery through the Del Taco app.

1134
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,040
Del Taco's 420 Roller Days with a Z deal is time to coincide

1135
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,040
with the unofficial national cannabis holiday.

1136
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
God almighty.

1137
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,040
It's so great because it goes from like, you have over here Chiba Hut,

1138
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,040
who is clearly a cop, to this side where it's like your friend

1139
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,040
who just bought marijuana for the first time ever is like,

1140
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,040
yeah, I've got some of that stuff.

1141
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,040
If you want to come over on.

1142
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,040
I understand what Del Taco is saying, but I do have to ask,

1143
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,040
what would it take to make it the official cannabis holiday?

1144
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,040
Are you envisioning a reality where our incredible,

1145
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,040
our incredible by Camaro house is join,

1146
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,040
join hands for one gleaming moment and say, let's make this baby official?

1147
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,040
There's a lot that we don't see eye to eye on.

1148
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,040
We can all agree.

1149
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,040
Today's the funny weed day, right?

1150
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Let the children out from school.

1151
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,040
AOC, Lindsey, you're with me, right?

1152
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,040
It's the funny weed day.

1153
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,040
Have you seen these fucking values at Del Taco?

1154
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Make it official.

1155
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,040
The first unanimous vote across all of government, city to federal.

1156
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,040
It's coincide with the unofficial national cannabis holiday

1157
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,040
to fulfill those mass munchy needs.

1158
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:40,040
But whether you wake and bake or don't partake, fuck off.

1159
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
Like, seriously?

1160
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
Oh, thanks for letting me know.

1161
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
I can buy Del Taco even if I'm not high.

1162
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
What are you talking about?

1163
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Del Taco, presumably you write every other press release

1164
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
for people who don't smoke weed.

1165
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,040
Why do you have to include them in this one?

1166
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,040
They can enjoy a smoking deal.

1167
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:04,040
But wait, our tour of the nation's 420 deals would not be complete

1168
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,040
without DJ Khaled.

1169
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,040
DJ Khaled!

1170
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
Another one, virtual brand.

1171
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
DJ Khaled's virtual brand.

1172
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,040
What's that mean?

1173
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,040
It adds plant-based wings.

1174
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Sorry, hold on.

1175
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
Sorry, hold on.

1176
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,040
We've talked about his restaurant before, right?

1177
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
Yes, I thought so.

1178
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
It says virtual brand, right?

1179
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
It's a ghost kitchen.

1180
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,040
I would like to think that I have something resembling a virtual brand

1181
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,040
and I did not know I could just add chicken wings to it.

1182
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,040
I am going to say some of the proper nouns from DJ Khaled's restaurant

1183
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,040
as if it is the first time I'm saying them,

1184
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,040
but I want you to know I'm saying it because they delight me so much.

1185
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,040
DJ Khaled's another wing unveils like wings.

1186
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,040
New plant-based additions to its U.S. menu

1187
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,040
in partnership with Likemeat, a live kindly collective brand.

1188
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,040
The unique collaboration marks Likemeat's first ghost kitchen partnership, etc.

1189
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,040
Likemeat's juicy and delicious plant-based wings

1190
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,040
come smothered in another wing's signature flavors

1191
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,040
including U Loyal lemon pepper,

1192
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,040
Wow.

1193
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,040
honey, honey, hot honey sriracha.

1194
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,040
Sorry, did you add the extra honey for effect?

1195
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Honey, honey, hot honey sriracha.

1196
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,040
And my personal favorite, they don't want you to win Truffalo.

1197
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:38,040
To celebrate the launch, another wing will co-host a pop-up wing dispensary

1198
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,040
aptly named Another Wing Dispensary

1199
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,040
in partnership with The Flowery in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood on April 20th.

1200
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,040
Oh.

1201
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,040
Yeah.

1202
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,040
Shit, all these are today, it's too late for me to get any of this stuff.

1203
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
This is DJ Khaled.

1204
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,040
This like wings collaboration is an incredible opportunity

1205
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,040
for people who don't eat meat to enjoy the incredible flavors of Another Wing.

1206
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,040
As you know, I'm very picky about what I eat, and I'll eat these wings.

1207
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,040
This collab combines the flavors of Another Wing with the plant power of Likemeat.

1208
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
Says DJ Khaled, let's win more.

1209
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
The noted power expert.

1210
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
Let's win more with Likewings.

1211
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Is it like me? Is that the bit?

1212
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
Because that's not a good name for it.

1213
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,040
All the other ones were taken.

1214
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
We've already gone beyond meat.

1215
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,040
What else do we have?

1216
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
Beyond, beyond meat.

1217
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,040
If someone sent me something and I said, is this meat?

1218
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,040
And they said, it's like meat.

1219
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
Okay, I'm good.

1220
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,040
Michelle Collette, the head of food service for Likemeat says,

1221
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,040
we're flying high with this new partnership

1222
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,040
and are beyond excited for Another Wing's fans to try these awesome Likewings

1223
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
the next time the munchies strike.

1224
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
It's not fun anymore.

1225
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
Yeah, weed's not fun anymore.

1226
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,040
Weed's not fun anymore.

1227
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,040
Let's change it to another day.

1228
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,040
Let's make it July 13th or something.

1229
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,040
July 11th, just after the QR code runs out.

1230
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,040
This is like July 11th.

1231
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
That's 7-Eleven.

1232
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
7-Eleven would love that.

1233
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
Come on in for that.

1234
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,040
I don't think that could be the weed day too.

1235
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
It's fine.

1236
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
7-Eleven.

1237
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,040
You know, I stopped at the fast mart on the way up here

1238
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:30,040
and I got my snacks and my drink and they said 7-Eleven

1239
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,040
and I said, no, it's not.

1240
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
It's fast mart.

1241
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,040
That's good.

1242
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,040
And the guy gave me nothing.

1243
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,040
I thought it was pretty, anyway.

1244
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
That's good.

1245
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,040
This is Likemeat's first flight into the ghost kitchen world

1246
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
and we're in it to wing it.

1247
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
That's not a good thing though.

1248
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:52,040
Described as the world's most ambitious restaurant launch.

1249
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,040
Holy shit.

1250
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,040
Another wing debuted in November 2021 across 150 locations

1251
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,040
and three continents at the same time.

1252
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,040
So DJ Khaled has plant-based wings with his grape flavors.

1253
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
That's the story.

1254
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,040
That's all of the 420 that's happening out there.

1255
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,040
There's probably much, much, much, much more.

1256
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
No, there's actually not.

1257
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Oh, okay.

1258
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
You found it all.

1259
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Yeah.

1260
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,040
A lot of people said I would never be able to find all the weed stuff,

1261
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,040
but that's everything.

1262
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Good job.

1263
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:39,040
I am a law student.

1264
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,040
I've been told by multiple attorneys and professors that it's very important

1265
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:49,040
to have lawyer face, i.e. not showing any reaction or emotion.

1266
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,040
The problem is I have an extremely emotive face.

1267
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,040
It's not a secret that what I'm feeling at any time.

1268
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,040
Brothers, how can I develop a lawyer face?

1269
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,040
Do you have any tips for practicing non-reactions?

1270
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,040
That's from straight faced in St. Louis.

1271
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,040
Are you here?

1272
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
That's perfect.

1273
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Nice.

1274
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
That's a good story.

1275
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Appropriate.

1276
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Objection.

1277
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
Even that was a little too just.

1278
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,040
Maybe you could just pick one emotion all the time.

1279
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,040
Oh, that's great.

1280
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,040
I'm super emotive, but it's always confused.

1281
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
No, wait.

1282
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
That's a terrible lawyer.

1283
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,040
That's the worst lawyer emotion that you can possibly express.

1284
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,040
He got hit by a big truck?

1285
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,040
Huh?

1286
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
There's a video of it?

1287
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Oh, no.

1288
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,040
But my guy's the truck guy.

1289
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,040
Oh, no.

1290
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,040
Griffin does raise a fun point.

1291
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,040
He was drunk?

1292
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,040
That's my guy, though.

1293
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:59,040
Maybe your thing could just be the one super emotive lawyer.

1294
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,040
You could be the one who's like, oh, man.

1295
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
Why is it always disappointing?

1296
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:11,040
Your Honor, and I have here the call logs from that evening.

1297
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,040
And you just hear from the back of the place, oh, man.

1298
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
Not the call logs.

1299
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
Oh, dang it.

1300
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Oh, you were right, Doug.

1301
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
They found it.

1302
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
They got it.

1303
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,040
You were right.

1304
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,040
You said they wouldn't have it, and I said they definitely wouldn't.

1305
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,040
You were right.

1306
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Oh, man.

1307
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
I know.

1308
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,040
You said they'd find it.

1309
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,040
I was like, nah, man.

1310
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
Steve Jobs locks that shit up.

1311
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:37,040
And then you were like, Steve Jobs famously died a long time ago.

1312
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,040
And I said, what?

1313
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
Hey, Vicky, straight up.

1314
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,040
I got to give it to you.

1315
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,040
You are a good lawyer, for sure.

1316
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,040
I wouldn't have found it in a million years.

1317
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
That's so choice.

1318
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,040
At least you didn't find the bloody clothes, though, did you?

1319
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Yay!

1320
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
Sunk!

1321
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
Ah, damn it.

1322
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,040
Oh, man.

1323
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Let's call it a tie.

1324
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,040
Hey, Judge.

1325
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
We will take that plea deal now, actually.

1326
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,040
Yeah, actually, now that we will do it.

1327
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Is it too late to turn state's evidence?

1328
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,040
That's not a thing in this case?

1329
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
Okay.

1330
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,040
Damn.

1331
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:13,040
I would say that all lawyer commercials are the same, which is usually a big lawyer standing

1332
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,040
on top of a truck holding a hammer or some shit.

1333
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,040
That's just that one lawyer in Austin.

1334
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,040
No, but they're always, they're like throwing lightning bolts down.

1335
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,040
Smiting their enemies.

1336
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,040
Smiting doctors.

1337
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,040
Or like a truck is, there's a lot of trucks.

1338
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Like a truck is speeding at them and they just hold up a hand and the truck flips over them.

1339
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,040
See, in Cincinnati, there's one guy who just is like, how hard I'll fight for you.

1340
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,040
And he has boxing gloves and he's punching a punching bag, which I was like, listen,

1341
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,040
if things go south and it doesn't look like you're going to win,

1342
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,040
we're going to fight our way out.

1343
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:55,040
But if there was a commercial that for a law firm where everyone in it was crying the whole time,

1344
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,040
I would be too curious to go anywhere else for my legal needs.

1345
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,040
You know what, I guarantee that if that was your thing, like in court,

1346
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,040
if you get any bad news, I'm going to break into huge tears.

1347
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,040
You'd watch the judge like, I'm going to have to rule.

1348
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,040
Oh, please don't cry.

1349
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Oh no.

1350
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,040
You know what, it is it.

1351
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
It's a tie.

1352
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
It's a tie.

1353
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,040
I couldn't.

1354
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,040
There's an attorney in Austin I'm sure I talked about on the show before called David Comey,

1355
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,040
the attorney that rocks.

1356
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,040
He's here.

1357
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
God, I would fucking love it.

1358
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,040
If you are here, David Comey, just come backstage and if someone tries to stop you, push them aside

1359
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,040
because you're very big.

1360
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:39,040
But he does look like a Geico caveman and I've seen so many billboards with this gentleman on it

1361
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,040
and been like, that's who I would, that's absolutely who I would rock with if accused of a crime.

1362
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:50,040
He may be bad at being a lawyer, but I'm so curious.

1363
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
That's a good way to hire anyone.

1364
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,040
Yeah, right?

1365
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,040
Yeah.

1366
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,040
How bad could it be?

1367
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,040
He has good billboards.

1368
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,040
He rocks.

1369
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,040
I know he rocks.

1370
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,040
You can't just say that without proof.

1371
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,040
What's up, guys?

1372
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Jurisprudence.

1373
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,040
How many points do I get for that?

1374
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,040
I'll fight anyone in here.

1375
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,040
Kick your ass, judge.

1376
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,040
You have to do something more distracting than your face.

1377
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,040
Huh.

1378
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,040
I don't have a rest of that paragraph.

1379
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,040
Yeah.

1380
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,040
Well, you could be the masked lawyer.

1381
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,040
Oh shit.

1382
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,040
It works for Magic's Greatest Secrets, that guy.

1383
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,040
Yeah, we never found out who that dude was.

1384
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,040
Or Magic, I mean, there's Masked Singer, that's huge.

1385
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,040
Yeah, that works.

1386
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,040
That's never turned out bad.

1387
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:44,040
But then everybody who's like, God, here comes the masked lawyer, I know it's Rudy Giuliani.

1388
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
How does Masked Singer keep the magic alive?

1389
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,040
No, they wouldn't hire him if they thought it was Rudy Giuliani.

1390
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,040
Well, that's why he wears a mask.

1391
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,040
Of course they wouldn't hire Rudy Giuliani to be there.

1392
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,040
Didn't you see Borat 2?

1393
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,040
He's a bad person, Travis.

1394
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,040
They wouldn't hire him.

1395
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,040
He's bad and mean.

1396
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
You guys are right.

1397
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
I really blew that one.

1398
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Remember the Four Seasons?

1399
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Remember?

1400
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,040
Yeah.

1401
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
He's like bad.

1402
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Yeah.

1403
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
They wouldn't hire him.

1404
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,040
And you remember when the evil ran down his face like Zerg?

1405
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,040
You know, like Zerg in Fifth Element?

1406
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,040
You guys remember.

1407
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,040
Remember Ghostbusters?

1408
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,040
We're going to lose some fans here, guys.

1409
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,040
Rudy Giuliani's bad, and that's the end of this episode.

1410
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
We'll say it.

1411
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,040
The cheapest.

1412
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Our dad came out here in a fucking blues jersey,

1413
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,040
and that was the cheapest request for applause, I think,

1414
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,040
that we've ever done.

1415
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,040
I want to help more people.

1416
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,040
I'm not done.

1417
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,040
I can't stop.

1418
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,040
I'm the mother of three grown sons.

1419
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,040
This is a question.

1420
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,040
I'm the mother of three grown sons.

1421
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,040
People seem to enjoy asking which is my favorite

1422
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,040
or even telling me who they think is my favorite.

1423
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,040
I don't have a favorite.

1424
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
How can I convince people I love all my boys the same?

1425
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
A good, good mom?

1426
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,040
Are you here?

1427
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Okay.

1428
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,040
All right.

1429
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,040
Loving them all the same is not the same as not having a favorite.

1430
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,040
Thank you, Travis.

1431
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
Travis speaks from experience.

1432
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,040
No more to be said.

1433
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,040
I got two kids.

1434
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,040
I love them both equally, and they're both my favorite

1435
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,040
at different times.

1436
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
Yeah.

1437
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,040
I love my kids equally.

1438
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,040
I like my kids different.

1439
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:31,040
One of my kids only refers to me as the big baboon.

1440
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:38,040
And folks, I mean, exclusively, in good times and in bad,

1441
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,040
feast and famine.

1442
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,040
Even when she wants something from him, which is fun to watch.

1443
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,040
I am the big baboon.

1444
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,040
So guess which of my kids I like better?

1445
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,040
Yes, it's that one.

1446
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,040
I have self-esteem issues.

1447
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,040
What part wasn't a joke, but okay?

1448
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,040
You can't tell me that in the history with these three grown sons,

1449
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,040
there wasn't a time where two of them were acting like assholes

1450
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,040
and one was being totally chill and cool, and you didn't think,

1451
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,040
thank you.

1452
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,040
If you like one more than the others, sometimes don't say anything.

1453
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,040
Yeah.

1454
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,040
All right.

1455
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
All right.

1456
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,040
I gotcha.

1457
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,040
I have a favorite brother.

1458
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,040
That's Paul.

1459
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,040
He brings me drinks.

1460
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,040
Yeah, everybody has, I mean, I don't think you need to love people.

1461
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
You can love somebody.

1462
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,040
That goes deeper than liking.

1463
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,040
I dislike a lot of people I love sometimes.

1464
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,040
You know, it's normal.

1465
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,040
Why are you looking at me?

1466
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,040
It's normal.

1467
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,040
I also think, though, anybody who looks at you and goes,

1468
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,040
who's your favorite?

1469
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
They're an asshole.

1470
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1471
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
It's an unsoaked thing.

1472
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,040
We all get it.

1473
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,040
Sometimes you look at your kid and you're like, fuck you.

1474
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,040
It happens.

1475
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
The other option that, sorry, unless.

1476
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,040
Unless.

1477
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,040
You could also, next time you're asked that question, you say,

1478
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,040
well, let's take it to the leaderboard.

1479
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,040
And then you have a big leaderboard with points.

1480
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,040
I have one of those at home, and I'm like, Henry, I wrote here,

1481
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,040
elbowed your dad right in the penis while you were flossing.

1482
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Minus 50 points.

1483
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,040
Wait, what kind of flossing?

1484
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,040
The dance.

1485
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,040
If you could stand up and demonstrate real quick, just like.

1486
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,040
We really showed you, Justin.

1487
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,040
It was a little frenzy, but I'm really excited.

1488
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Will you teach me that later?

1489
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Because my kids keep it.

1490
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,040
I'm going to give you a deal.

1491
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,040
Teach you how to floss.

1492
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,040
I'll teach you how to dougie.

1493
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
Fair?

1494
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
That sounds totally fair.

1495
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,040
I abstain.

1496
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,040
Yeah.

1497
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:36,040
And that's why dad likes him the least.

1498
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,040
I remember going up and dad would look at us like, dougie on three.

1499
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,040
And I'd be like, wait, I can't, dad, no.

1500
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
It hasn't been invented yet.

1501
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,040
The Cali swag boys are at nursery school.

1502
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:51,040
To step outside the bit, Justin's been talking about dougieing a lot lately.

1503
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,040
Seemingly, too.

1504
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,040
It's been like a recursive thing where he said, oh, I'll do this thing right.

1505
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,040
Teach me how to dougie.

1506
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,040
And we said, no one talks about that anymore.

1507
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,040
And he took that as a challenge to talk about it a lot more.

1508
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:11,040
I feel like he got a promo code from masterclass to learn how to dougie.

1509
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Which, you know, we all get promo codes from masterclass all the time.

1510
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,040
Right, and that's what you elect to spend yours on.

1511
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,040
Do you want someone to ask you?

1512
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,040
Is that the problem?

1513
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,040
No, I don't want anyone to ask me.

1514
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:30,040
First, they must scale the 7,000 steps of his sacred mountain to find his temple at the top where he awaits.

1515
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,040
Waiting for the true pupil.

1516
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:39,040
There you'll find Justin, but wait, it's Tilda Swinton in a Justin outfit.

1517
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,040
Didn't expect that, did you?

1518
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Oh, shit.

1519
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,040
Just pick a favorite son.

1520
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,040
Hey, thank you so much for coming to our program.

1521
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:54,040
We appreciate you very much.

1522
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
I want to say thank you to, gosh, where to start?

1523
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,040
Clint McElroy.

1524
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,040
Who's lovely book, Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding, I think May 10th.

1525
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,040
May 10th.

1526
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
Order it.

1527
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,040
Don't throw it on the stage and piss on it.

1528
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,040
I feel real bad about it.

1529
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Or pretend to piss on it.

1530
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,040
Both equally bad, I think.

1531
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Thank you to Paul Sabourin.

1532
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:27,040
Thank you so much to Rachel and Amanda for being here and helping to support us and recording our shows and making sure the trains run on time.

1533
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,040
Thank you.

1534
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,040
Thank you to the Stevel Theatre.

1535
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Thank you, Stevel Theatre.

1536
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,040
Beautiful.

1537
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,040
Thank you to my wife, Rachel.

1538
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,040
My wife.

1539
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,040
For everything.

1540
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,040
Thank you to my partner, Teresa.

1541
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,040
I'm not going to give you the setup.

1542
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,040
My wife.

1543
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,040
My wife.

1544
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,040
Okay.

1545
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,040
My wife, Teresa, for being here and being supportive and to my kids for being here.

1546
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,040
Justin, anything you want to say?

1547
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,040
When I walked through the airport today, I could not wipe the smile from my face.

1548
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,040
Everyone would ask me, Justin, how's it going?

1549
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,040
And I'd say, I'm traveling without my kids.

1550
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,040
If you want, I could fly.

1551
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,040
And so I love you guys.

1552
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,040
I hope you're doing good.

1553
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:17,040
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

1554
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Okay.

1555
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Now we need a celebrity impression.

1556
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,040
This is the dumb.

1557
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,040
How did this?

1558
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,040
Someone here.

1559
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,040
The first like three rows.

1560
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Yeah.

1561
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,040
Just raise your hand if you have a good one.

1562
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Okay.

1563
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,040
Yes.

1564
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,040
Yeah.

1565
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,040
Right here.

1566
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,040
Oh.

1567
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,040
Yeah.

1568
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,040
Dearly departed Gilbert Garfrey.

1569
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,040
Go ahead.

1570
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,040
Whenever you're ready.

1571
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,040
Please tasteful.

1572
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,040
He's a little respectful.

1573
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Please, Griffin.

1574
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,040
He's not dead.

1575
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,040
He is dead.

1576
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,040
Yeah, Griffin.

1577
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,040
I wish we'd let him do it before we told him.

1578
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,040
Griffin, go on.

1579
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,040
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

1580
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,040
Now this, I will say we've done a lot of live shows.

1581
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,040
This is a unique energy to close on.

1582
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Please just one sentence.

1583
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Griffin, do anything.

1584
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,040
Griffin, please end the show.

1585
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,040
Just end the show.

1586
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:11,040
Just say something like Gilbert Garfrey and we'll talk about it after.

1587
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Please.

1588
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
Please, Griffin.

1589
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,040
Listen, folks.

1590
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,040
Shut up.

1591
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:29,040
Because this is a fucking tribute now.

1592
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,040
I feel it too.

1593
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,040
Listen, folks.

1594
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,040
I made a few mistakes here and there.

1595
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,040
Told a joke or two I shouldn't have told.

1596
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,040
But it's me, your friend Iago.

1597
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,040
Remember me forever.

1598
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
My great contribute.

1599
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,040
I can't do it.

1600
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,040
My name's Justin O'Connor.

1601
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,040
My name's Justin McElroy.

1602
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,040
I'm Travis McElroy.

1603
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1604
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,040
This is my brother, my brother and me.

1605
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1606
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:09,040
It's better, it's better with you.

1607
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:22,040
It's better, it's better with you.

1608
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:33,040
It's better, it's better with you.
