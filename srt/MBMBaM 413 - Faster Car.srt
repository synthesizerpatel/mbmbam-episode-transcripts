1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,680
And folks, it's a special time of year for me. There's an event going on right now I'm very

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
passionate about called Summer Games Sun Quick, where the whole video game speedrun community

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
gets together and starts just burning these bad boys down. Crash is there, Sonic's there,

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
Mario is not there, because he said too many cuss words last year. But I was thinking, Justin and

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
Travis, this could be an exciting opportunity for us to sort of expand the brand, reach out to this

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,560
thriving speedrun audience, and maybe we get into the scene, pick some stuff that we think we could

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,120
really knock down the world records for, and climb that climb that time mountain. And what I thought

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,080
I would start out with, and I would pitch it to you guys and see what you thought, is I'm gonna

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,160
speedrun Boyhood. Okay, the movie? The Richard Linklater movie Boyhood. Okay. Okay. Because I

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,240
watched it, and because I try to be a good Austin boy, and I watched all of it, and I just thought

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,400
I could watch this so much. It's not optimized. I could get through this a lot faster. You watch

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,840
the boy, and the boy learns like a lesson when he's a little boy, and there's, you know, there's

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,960
so many shitty dads in that movie, and it's like I could easily find the skips to get past at least

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,280
two or three of these shitty dads. And I'm working on this new strat where he doesn't go to college,

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,600
and so that's, that's, I'm picking up some time there. Okay. I guess, Griffin, what I'm confused

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,440
about is like you could just fast forward, or you could just like, it's a cheat. Skip scenes. No,

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,560
fast forward is cheating, and everybody knows that, but if you can get the shitty second dad skip,

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,480
and then get right to grown-up Patricia Arquette, then you get, you see the, you know, you get what's

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,320
going on in the movie, but then the boy got really older, and you did it in less time. So I've been

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,160
working on, I got the runtime down to like an hour five. The Japanese, yeah, the Japanese runner

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
community for Boyhood has figured out some new clips. There's a part where you can make the boy

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
go right through the wall of his house and get outside out of bounds, and then all of a sudden

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
he's like 15 or so. Oh wow. Yeah, so I've been working on that, but it's, you know, it's like a

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,960
picture. Are there any like warp whistles or anything? There is a warp whistle in Boyhood,

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Travis, and I'm so glad you asked. A lot of people miss out on it, but it's in the

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,480
silverware drawer in the kitchen of the second house. How are you interacting with the scenes

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,800
in this, in this sort of scenario that you've crafted here? This real scenario,

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
or is it a touch thing? Is it a voice activation thing? How are you interacting with the film

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,360
Boyhood? Is it like a click controller thing? Are you clicking your controller at the film Boyhood?

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,360
With the click controller. Sort of like a Blu-ray, choose your own adventure sort of thing that was

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
so hot for a while. I'm so glad that Travis brought up click because I do, I'm actually like

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,120
third on the leaderboards for that one because in that one you can just make Adam Sandler press the

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,680
go button way, way faster. And then like his kids, like they turn into skeleton bones, like from the

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Indiana Jones movie where the guy drinks the bad cup. And he gets really sad, but I get really

42
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,880
happy because my fucking PB is like off the charts now. So it's not a hundred percent run,

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,880
just to be clear. Any percent kids turn into skeleton bones run is the category there. But

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,360
for Boyhood, it's mostly yelling at the boy to, you know, run through, clip through the wall.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
It's you, it's you running, yelling at the boy.

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Yeah. And then there is some screen touching, but that's mostly for me.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Now I have been doing this with the Up series of films. Are y'all familiar with the Up series?

48
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
Like the film Up?

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,920
No, there, there was a documentary film series called the Up series. It started with Seven Up

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,080
and then it was seven plus seven, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up. They just, every seven years they check in

51
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
on this series of kids. So they started out at seven and then every seven years they make another

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,760
movie about these fools. Like, well, how are y'all doing? How's it going? I actually found a hack

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,840
for this one, which is I just skipped a 49 Up because who gives a shit? This is now, you know

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,920
what I mean? 56 Up, I got a new strat. 56 Up is coming out next year. I think I'm just going to

55
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,280
skip to that one from now on. So I'm hoping to get my time down even quicker. I can skip straight to

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,680
these fools being 56 years old. No problem.

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
I, you know, I will actually say I've been doing this with Great British Bake Off

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
because I'll start and you know, you'll watch a bunch of it. And then I realized like,

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
I can just go to the store and buy a cake.

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
Yeah.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,480
And like, when you do that, you kind of just like do it, right? Without having to watch each episode.

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,400
Because really the whole reason you watch Great British Bake Off is so that you just get like,

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,040
so fucking horny for baked goods.

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,920
And you have to like eat them. So just like cut out the middleman and just eat the baked goods.

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:48,560
I had a memory last night of, I was watching GBBO last night with my wife and they,

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
it was cakes. It was a cake episode.

68
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,320
And I was thinking about it during the cake episode. I was remembering a time when I was

69
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,720
in elementary school and I won a cake walk. And if you remember, I don't know if y'all,

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
like that's, I think that's just, just a metaphor now for kids, kids these days.

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
But a cake walk is like a bunch of people stand in like a circle and they call numbers,

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,360
kind of like musical chairs. So one person ends up owning a cake.

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
And at the end of this cake walk, I ended up owning a cake.

74
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
As a child.

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
As a child, I owned a cake and I can, I realized that I peaked.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,840
Yeah.

77
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,040
Then the feeling I had of like, I own a cake. This is my cake and I own it.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,760
And I'm eight years old and I own this cake. I'm the owner of an entire cake that I own.

79
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,040
I own this.

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Justin, isn't it weird to you that you accidentally did like crossover fan fiction

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,600
of Great British Bake Off and boyhood? Like you have just described like,

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,520
you like put in a cheat code for Justin McElroy boyhood,

83
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,600
where like a Great British Bake Off cake appeared and eight-year-old Justin just had it.

84
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Welcome to 37 Up. We're checking back in with Justin McElroy.

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,040
You'll remember in our past four films, Justin has just talked about the cake he won

86
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,560
when he was eight. So let's check in and see how he's doing.

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Nope. Still the cake.

88
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,120
Haven't topped it.

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
Haven't beaten that.

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
Love my kids. Love my wife.

91
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Love my kids. Love the wife. Got the house, the podcast, whatever. Can't beat the cake.

92
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,400
Also, we're very sorry that we missed a couple of years there and had to do 37 Up.

93
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,480
Some of these rascally kids were just hard to get a hold of this time.

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,400
It is worth pointing out that I want to, it's not that,

95
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,840
because Justin, if I may speak for you as your representative for a moment,

96
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,560
I don't think it's that Justin doesn't love his kids and his wife more than a cake,

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:56,640
but comparatively, eight-year-old Justin, a cake is like having eight wives and 16 kids.

98
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,560
It's just the ca- Oh, that sounds so good, Trav.

99
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,040
No, I think your metaphor fell apart a little bit there.

100
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,880
It was like being eight and owning an entire cake because it wasn't just,

102
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,040
you have to remember that it wasn't just my ability to eat an entire cake if I want to.

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,160
Of course, I was intoxicating. But think about the power.

104
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
Think about the power that I had as an eight-year-old and owner of a cake.

105
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,520
No one could take it from you because it was yours. You had not snatched this cake.

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,640
It's extremely powerful. I'll never top it.

107
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,680
How about a first question?

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I would love to answer a question and help people here on episode 413.

109
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,480
Hey, we always say this at the end, but it's on my heart right now.

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,160
Thank you to everybody who has listened to us blather on for 413 episodes.

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,240
We appreciate you very much, and we so appreciate you sparing an hour of your time.

112
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
413 is like so many.

113
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,320
That's a lot.

114
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,680
It's a lot.

115
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm so appreciative to all y'all.

116
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
I work at a very fancy hotel.

117
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm a detective at a very fancy hotel.

118
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,600
A new employee recently joined my team of hotel detectives,

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and in an effort to be friendly and helpful,

120
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
I've been answering their questions about our policies and so on.

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,440
However, in recent days, her questions have taken a different tone,

122
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,280
pumping me for info on things like how late the security guards stay in the building,

123
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,400
how many cameras are in the service corridors,

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,440
if the codes for interdoors change regularly.

125
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
How much trouble am I in?

126
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
Should I alert the hotel authorities?

127
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Then again, I'm on minimum wage.

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Should I be asking to get in on the grift?

129
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
Yup, yup, yup.

130
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,400
That's from an unwilling extra in an Oceans movie in Dublin, Ireland.

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,440
Okay, so listen.

132
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,280
You are on the razor's edge right now.

133
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
You are on the thinnest ice right now.

134
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,000
What happens now makes or breaks the ice, I guess, that you're standing on,

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,520
because you need to start very subtly laying down hints

136
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,280
that you are down to clown until you're in the ground.

137
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,800
And I'm talking about like this new employee walks into your office

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
and is like, where are you?

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,840
And then you climb out of the garbage can

140
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,640
where you've folded yourself up to get in a real tiny place.

141
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
And you're like, oh, sorry about that.

142
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,280
Sometimes I fold up my body real small into real small shapes

143
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,920
to climb into the garbage can because I'm so super flexible.

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,680
But what was your questions?

145
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,520
And maybe like when the employee's nearby,

146
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
like in the break room or something,

147
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
without even batting an eyelash,

148
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
like steal a lunch from the refrigerator and say like,

149
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
I don't even mind stealing things from people.

150
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
Make it clear your morals are real flexible,

152
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,520
as flexible as your body.

153
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,480
You ruined it already by writing into us.

154
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,960
You've just provided this.

155
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,720
Do you realize this is probably the first episode

156
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
of our Brother on Brother May?

157
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
Where somewhere in the world, somewhere in time,

158
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
a detective has just like pulled off their headphones

159
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
and turned around at the corkboard they have with like pictures

160
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,840
and thread tied between it like this is it.

161
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
It all makes sense.

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
The clues were here the entire time

163
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
in this dumb, dumb podcast.

164
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,040
You know what?

165
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,760
In fact, just in case that this ever gets played

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
as evidence in a courtroom, fart.

167
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,840
Ah, nice.

168
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,480
Got him.

169
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,800
Got him.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,080
A big, a big ass.

171
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you hear that?

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Do you hear that, judge?

173
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
A big ass fart.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,280
I present for the jury a big turd, a big juicy one.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,720
Assholes.

176
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
I got a new exhibit.

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
It's number 69.

178
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah, I got an objection.

179
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I'd like to turn your attention to exhibit D.

180
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
D's not.

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,920
I got you all, you fucking courtroom dum-dums.

182
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Okay, this is more of a visual one,

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,240
so you're gonna have to picture me here,

184
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
but I have just walked up to the lawyer's briefcase

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
and I've thrown all their papers in the air

186
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
and I've said, these papers are out of order.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
Okay, but that's, you can't.

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,760
But like, but you won't do that.

189
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah, I picture it, but you won't.

190
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,520
Somebody do it.

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,120
Stenographer, stenographer.

192
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Flip those papers in the air.

193
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,240
Those papers are out of order.

194
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm holding myself in contempt.

195
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
And like, maybe hold yourself.

196
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
Like, a hug.

197
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,160
That's nice.

198
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
Everybody give yourself a nice hug in the court.

199
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah, you know what, jury?

200
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
You're free to go.

201
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Hey, everybody.

202
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
Everybody in the court.

203
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
Oh, this is gonna be good.

204
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Everybody in the court.

205
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm evidence, so you have to do what I say, legally speaking.

206
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
Everybody in the court, just like,

207
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,040
let's just sort of close our eyes and bow our heads.

208
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
It's sort of like, if you're into praying, that's cool,

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
or just like, sort of make peace in the moment, right now.

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,740
Okay.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
Run for it.

212
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
Keep them close, everybody.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,640
Keep them close.

214
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,680
Keep them close, everybody.

215
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
When they really think it.

216
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
Go, go, go, go, go.

217
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,520
You're free.

218
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,960
There's a car outside.

219
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,680
It's Grixin.

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,400
He's driving it.

221
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,760
He's driving it forward slash donate.

222
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
You just gotta go ahead and make sure you hit us back for this.

223
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
With emeralds.

224
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
We accept emeralds.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,280
Emeralds are fine.

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm sorry, but I've turned state's evidence.

227
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
They've run out.

228
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
They had it out of the court.

229
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,320
Open your eyes.

230
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,640
They're getting away.

231
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,200
No, Travis.

232
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,840
Travis, the emeralds.

233
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
It's too late.

235
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,840
I had a lot of stuff I was trying to beat, and they said that they would let me off if

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
I turned states.

237
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,360
That's your deal.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
I get it.

239
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,560
I, you know, this is a unique enough situation that I would like us to, you know, we've done

240
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
a bunch of dumb stuff in the past few minutes.

241
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,800
What would you do?

242
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,560
Because like, this is kind of shady, but I'm not sure I would want to like confront the

243
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,880
person about it because they might be the sort that, you know, some have a heart of

244
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,680
gold.

245
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,760
The only reason they say, like, they talk about some criminals have a heart of gold

246
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,440
is to differentiate them from other criminals who most assuredly don't.

247
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Yeah.

248
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,480
And I'm worried that like maybe you got one of the bad eggs that just cut you down.

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
A heart of shit.

250
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,560
It's possible.

251
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,840
I have an idea here and a certain level of like deniability that might save your life

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,920
while still foiling their plans, which is you then go ask those questions of somebody else,

253
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,800
right?

254
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,960
But in the exact same way they asked you.

255
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,880
And now that person will report you and you say, like, well, they were asking about it

256
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,600
and I didn't know the answer, so I was just trying to help them out.

257
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
You've just increased the body count, Trav.

258
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,280
Well, what if I ask 18 people?

259
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
How many people can they take out?

260
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
19, including you, because they could be a real dead pool.

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,520
Oh, no.

262
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,240
But at a certain point, maybe if I told like the chief of police and asked them.

263
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,960
Oh, good, Trav.

264
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah.

265
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,440
No, they got a kid on the way, so that's great.

266
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,760
Well done.

267
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
Anybody else that you want to?

268
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,700
Yeah.

269
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,040
I think what I would do, gosh, this is a toughie because the two results of this, you seem

270
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
like you're on the ball right now and that's good news.

271
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,200
You can either join their crew and now it's Ocean's.

272
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't know how many people they got, but let's say like five because you've joined

273
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
as the fifth member and you get to steal all the emeralds.

274
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,480
Maybe it's the chaos emeralds that are kept inside your hotel and you get those and then

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,640
you get a bunch of money and you get the thrill of doing that.

276
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,360
The other thrill you could get, though, is being a crime buster like My Hero Deadpool.

277
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm just saying, I think either way this breaks, you're good.

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,080
The only thing you can fuck this up with is if you do nothing.

279
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,240
You bust out, you join them, one of the two.

280
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,960
I will say, though, this might be a strong nothing move.

281
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,360
Justin, ask me how late the security guards stay in the building.

282
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
How late do the security guards stay in the building again?

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,480
I don't know.

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
Yeah, see, that's not good, Trav.

285
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
That's kind of exactly what I just said.

286
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,040
What does that do?

287
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,680
Yeah, that doesn't do anything.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
But in doing that, you know what?

289
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
That buck sails right over your head and on to the next person.

290
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,520
It's fun.

291
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,640
You didn't help the person and you didn't help the show, too.

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
You did two.

293
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,720
You failed twice at the same moment.

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,400
I might have helped the person because it's a lot of pressure sometimes to say like you

295
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,720
have to decide between either a life of crime or a life of detecting.

296
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,680
But what about just like nothing?

297
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,480
Hey, Trav, if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

298
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Mm, that was brilliant and rhythmic.

299
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,160
Thank you.

300
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
How about a Yahoo though?

301
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
Yahoo.

302
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
We have a lot of Yahoo's this week from people.

303
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
Like they sent, I got the same Yahoo from a lot of folks.

304
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
So thank you to everybody.

305
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
It was a very good week for Yahoo's.

306
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,680
A bunch of folks sent this one in.

307
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark.

308
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm gonna say Manny Ocean asks, is it blasphemy to say grace when eating food from Burger King?

309
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,760
Just considering it's fast food and always wondered if religious people consider it a sin

310
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,960
to thank God for the food when eating stuff like that.

311
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Just curious.

312
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,920
So yeah, you're at the table of Burger King.

313
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Is the idea here that if God had interceded with his divine providence,

314
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,080
that he would have served you up something better than BK?

315
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,720
Or like you would pray and Jesus would be like, I'm not blessing that shit.

316
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, you're at the Burger King table and you're like,

317
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,920
please bless these extremely salty, too crunchy fries

318
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,320
and our four sloppy sloppy Baconator Juniors in your most heavenly highest name, I pray.

319
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
And then, you know, God's in heaven.

320
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,600
He's like, oh, hold on, I got a call.

321
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,040
And then, you know, a hole forms in the cloud floor and he looks down it

322
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,120
and pulls out his magnifying glass and he sees what you're all up to

323
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
because you can see through the roofs of all buildings.

324
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Don't even try jerking off.

325
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,200
And so he sees the Burger King and goes,

326
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
um, no, no, I won't bless that one.

327
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
Get at me next time, maybe next time hit up, you know,

328
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,800
Steak and Shake or a more reputable burger establishment.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,280
I'll bless that.

330
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,560
A Red Robin.

331
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,680
A Red Robin.

332
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,360
I'll shout out to a Red Robin.

333
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,160
But the thing is, God and Jesus' love go where they're needed the most, right?

334
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
Not to fucking Burger King, Justin.

335
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
No, yeah, just not.

336
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,480
If I'm in a fancy, read about a fancy like steakhouse or something,

337
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't need God's help.

338
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
Jesus will fuck with a steakhouse.

339
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
That's it.

340
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah, so what Justin is suggesting is that your family's doing a big pray

341
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
right before the prom.

342
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,160
And they took you out to Ruth's Chris to get you like psyched up.

343
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
And then, you know, God's like, uh, yeah.

344
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
So, uh, I was thinking, oh, hold on, I got a call.

345
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
And a hole opens up in the cloud floor.

346
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
And he looks down with his magnifying glass.

347
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
He sees you in the Ruth's Chris.

348
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,920
And he sees just some just sizzling hunks just sitting on your platter

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,040
covered in like a nice garlic herb butter that's just juicily dribbling over the side.

350
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,840
It may be into like a tasty looking potato puree.

351
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
And it just looks real nice.

352
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
And he goes, you don't need my help on this one.

353
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
This is already.

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
I can't do anything to improve that.

355
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
That's doing good already.

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
You're at Ruth's Chris, baby.

357
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,000
That's what I get.

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,920
I just say that I feel like God's divine love and Jesus's amazing bounty.

359
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, like he helped the people that needed it the most, right?

360
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,000
For whatsoever you do unto the least of these you've done unto myself, right?

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,120
Like, I feel like that counts for Burger King as well.

362
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
I feel like Jesus is in this Burger King.

363
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,600
No.

364
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
You know, Jesus is in the McDonald's.

365
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,480
No, I think at most they send the Holy Spirit.

366
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,520
At most.

367
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
Yeah, to do their dirty work.

368
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,920
That's easily like Farm Team.

369
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,240
I have always wondered what the Holy Spirit has been doing.

370
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
That would actually explain a lot.

371
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,000
Can I posit one reason why they might not be big Burger King fans?

372
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,360
Why?

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
Idolatry.

374
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,840
Okay.

375
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,160
Yes.

376
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
By worshiping the king?

377
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Yeah, everybody's worshiping the Burger King.

378
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
The Burger King does make you bow to him before he sneaks up on you.

379
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
And he has the very, very scary face and body.

380
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,360
And he makes you bow and pray to him and accept him into your heart.

381
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,240
And then he gives like the kids crowns.

382
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,920
And now the kids think that there are these, you know, omnipotent God kings.

383
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,280
And don't get me wrong, the big man's not a big fan of how nasty all of the fries and burgers are.

384
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
But it's all the idolatry just running rampant.

385
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,120
So the scenario you're suggesting is that you pray, a hole opens up in the roof of the Burger King.

386
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
Jesus comes down and looks and peeks.

387
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
And he's like, but what of your earthly God?

388
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
What of your master, the Burger King?

389
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,280
What of his blessing?

390
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,400
Why do you need mine providence?

391
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
You have your master that you've hitched yourself to.

392
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
Yeah, enjoy your new God.

393
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,640
Let's see how long this one lasts.

394
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,840
Dear Burger King God, I'm having a hard time at school.

395
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
Can you help me pass the test?

396
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,640
Burger King God's not going to help you out with the test like Jesus can.

397
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,960
Well, to be fair, Burger King God just shows up and hands you a burger and you're like,

398
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
this is a test on salads.

399
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,280
This is good.

400
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,040
I mean, it's a test on neuroscience.

401
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,960
I could use any help.

402
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
No, just a burger again.

403
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Shoot.

404
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,000
If the Son of Man is indeed the King of Kings,

405
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,560
then you have to imagine that the Burger King does roll up to Jesus.

406
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,240
In which case, all Burger King's actions are,

407
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
I mean, according to the Bible,

408
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
are the direct result of the orders of Jesus Christ.

409
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
So what I'm saying is he's the King of Kings.

410
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
That means he's Burger King's boss.

411
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
So that means he is the one that Burger King is answering to

412
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
when prophets aren't where they would like to be.

413
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
When Burger King wanted to do a new fry formulation,

414
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
he had to ask Jesus's permission because he's the King of Kings.

415
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
He walks out of the corporate headquarters looking all dejected

416
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,120
because McDonald's has beaten their pants up and down.

417
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
And they're thinking we might have to close up shop

418
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
because nobody wants the BK.

419
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
But then what's that on the corner?

420
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
It's a burning garbage can.

421
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,040
And what's that?

422
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,800
There's a voice coming from inside.

423
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,480
Whoa, whoa, there's a burning garbage can.

424
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm very scared of that.

425
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,240
But he hears the voice and it calms and soothes him as it says,

426
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
chicken fries, dude.

427
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,320
Justin, are you about to say that you would murder some Burger King right now?

428
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,040
They got these new crispy pretzel chicken fries

429
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,280
that I'm dying to try.

430
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
Yeah, crispy pretzel coated chicken fries.

431
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,560
Don't mind if I do.

432
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Also Burger King does have the best fries.

433
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Of fast food chains, the winner is Rally's slash Checkers.

434
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,480
Well, but that's the US season curlies.

435
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
That doesn't count.

436
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,480
Incorrect.

437
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,040
Season straight.

438
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,880
What fucking podcast is this?

439
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,520
Season curlies.

440
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,400
It's actually, you guys are sort of infringing on my trademark podcast,

441
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,040
MuchSquad.

442
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,400
So I'll see you in court.

443
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
Here's another question.

444
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
A fellow student has taken it upon himself to start writing fan fiction

445
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,040
about all of us in my honors class at university.

446
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,600
I started actually reading them out of more of a curiosity.

447
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
It's come to my attention that if I often handily say

448
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,680
I enjoy something in class, it ends up becoming a major trait

449
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,360
for my quote character.

450
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
How do I explain to this kid there's more to me

451
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,160
than liking Star Wars and escape room games

452
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,640
without making things weirder than they already are?

453
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,720
I have to take multiple courses with this guy

454
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,160
and I'm afraid he's going to kill me off.

455
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,720
Oh my god, this is beautiful.

456
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
That's from Characterized in California.

457
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
Can I tell you the weirdest thing to me about this question?

458
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
We always jump in on these things and especially,

459
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,320
it's never me because I just finished reading the question.

460
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
I know, I had a time.

461
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Maybe people don't really think that we're taking the time

462
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,040
to think this thing through.

463
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,680
I want people to know that our advice is coming from

464
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
a place of consideration.

465
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,560
We've edited out probably several minutes of consideration

466
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,000
before we just leap in and start answering the questions.

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,040
It seems like the obvious solution right here

468
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,920
is not blow up your spot because you don't want to get...

469
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,160
This property this person's working on

470
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,480
could end up being the new AAA summer blockbuster franchise.

471
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm talking about movies, I'm talking about graphic novels,

472
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm talking about HBO premium TV with dicks and everything.

473
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,200
I mean, Shades of Grey was a Twilight fan fiction,

474
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,040
so like my dad says was a Twitter feed

475
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,600
and now it's a hit TV show with Bill Shatner.

476
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,240
Exploding, exploding, always exploding that property.

477
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,200
I mean, look at the cavemen were a Geico thing

478
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
and now look at them, you know what I mean?

479
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,280
They have their own sitcom probably still.

480
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Yeah, and then there's Shit My Caveman says

481
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,080
where they did just the two properties were so hot.

482
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
There was two broke cavemen, things they say shitty.

483
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah, and there was things my dad shit.

484
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
Things my dad shit, including a caveman

485
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
in that episode William Shatner goes in the toilet

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,280
and poops out a whole caveman.

487
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
So anyway, you want to be careful here.

488
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,720
You don't want to get written out of the story.

489
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
You got to make yourself as interesting as possible.

490
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
And I'm talking about you open up your JanSport one day

491
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,880
and you start to pull out a very magical looking sword.

492
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
But then you look around and notice

493
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
that the author has seen you,

494
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,440
you tuck that sword right back away,

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,280
you don't make a big deal out of it.

496
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,360
Now you got a sword in the book.

497
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
Or maybe like you open a really dramatic seeming letter

498
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
with like a big wax seal and you kind of gasp a little bit

499
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,120
right next to this person.

500
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,920
They're like, what?

501
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,600
You say like, well, it turns out my great aunt died

502
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
and she left me her spooky house,

503
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,600
but I have to spend the night in it if I want to inherit it.

504
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
That's really good too.

505
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,560
Or you open it up and you say, whoa, I got into Hogwarts.

506
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,120
I have spells, spell powers.

507
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
Another person trying to buy my oil fields?

508
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah, I mean, that one is going to go

509
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,240
more of a sort of dramatic non Harry Potter route.

510
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
I was trying to get that HP.

511
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,760
Well, someone's trying to buy my magical oil fields.

512
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,260
Yeah.

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,320
But you don't need to, you can't say,

514
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
well, for so many reasons,

515
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
you can't say anything about it, right?

516
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,560
That's not happening.

517
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
I don't think the concern about making things weird,

518
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
like that ship has sailed and it wasn't you that did it.

519
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
It's done, it's weird already.

520
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,160
You have to get weird to fix a weird situation.

521
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,440
Okay, this is not good advice, but welcome to the show.

522
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,920
Maybe just go to them like, hey, I read it, love it.

523
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
I've got some notes.

524
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,440
Got a few notes for you.

525
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
What if my character was six foot five?

526
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Next time write this in a G doc.

527
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,400
Let your boy get in there and comment a little bit.

528
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Kind of help shape this narrative.

529
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
Oh, you should be careful though,

530
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
because if they start to change things about your character,

531
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
it might start to change you in real life.

532
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Yes, I was just about to say that strange fiction heat.

533
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
Pagemaster.

534
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,440
You come into school the next day

535
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
and you're just sitting there in class,

536
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,080
you're taking good notes and expanding your horizons of mind,

537
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,680
and then you rip a big huge one.

538
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,640
And then everybody in class then changes your name to,

539
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,040
you know, the toot doctor,

540
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,400
and then you go home and you're like,

541
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,120
wow, that stunk.

542
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm gonna brighten my spirits up with some fan fiction about my life.

543
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,920
And then you see that exact scenario,

544
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
and it ends with like a little PS,

545
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,040
like books do sometimes,

546
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,760
where it says, PS, Toby, I got you, motherfucker.

547
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,760
That's illegal.

548
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,960
You gotta be careful.

549
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,120
You gotta be careful.

550
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,920
You don't know who has magic pens and or notebooks these days.

551
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,040
Are you checking the publish date on this stuff, by the way?

552
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,520
Oh, no.

553
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
Are you checking the publish date, by the way?

554
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,120
Are you making sure that You Liking Star Wars

555
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
wasn't written before you told everybody

556
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
how much you fucking love Star Wars?

557
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
I didn't even used to care about Star Wars,

558
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440
so I love it now.

559
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,480
When did this come out?

560
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,360
June 6th.

561
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,920
Well, that's 1885.

562
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh, what?

563
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,560
I was always wondering why it's yellowed.

564
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
Amazing.

565
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Doc Brown, you got my fucking number, dude.

566
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Let's take a break and get the money soon.

567
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
I want to tell you all about Bowling Branch.

568
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,680
Bowling Branch has the sheets.

569
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,280
They have the comforters.

570
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,480
They have the blankets.

571
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,200
They have the towels.

572
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
They got, if you need it soft,

573
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,240
they're going to have it.

574
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,160
And it's going to be pretty dang soft.

575
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,600
You could be getting some more sleep,

576
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
and not just more sleep,

577
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
but really, really good sleep on the soft, soft sheets

578
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
and blankets and everything else in Bowling Branch.

579
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,080
You could probably sleep with the towels.

580
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,400
They don't say to say that,

581
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,080
but the towels are soft enough.

582
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,040
And maybe if you do,

583
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,040
and I don't want to be crude here

584
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
because it's an ad for them.

585
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,560
They paid for it,

586
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,760
but they probably don't want me saying

587
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,440
that if you do make a sticky mess

588
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,200
and you have the towel there ready to go,

589
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,840
then nobody's going to need to know about that one.

590
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
But they make all their products from bedding to blankets

591
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
with pure 100% cotton.

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,880
Start out super soft,

593
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
and they get even softer over time.

594
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,920
They got thousands of five-star reviews.

595
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,000
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company

596
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
are all talking about Bowling Branch,

597
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,080
and shipping's free,

598
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,200
and you can try them for 30 nights

599
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
if you don't love them.

600
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,680
You just send them right back for a refund.

607
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Wouldn't it be funny if they made you say,

608
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,520
I slipped the sheet tongue twister,

609
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,680
and if you got it wrong, you didn't get any money?

610
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,800
For the ad?

611
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,920
For the ad.

612
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,560
But here's the problem,

613
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,800
Griffin, you talk about all those sheets,

614
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,240
and I'm still sleepy,

615
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,920
and I don't have nothing to put my sheets on.

616
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,880
Justin, what do I do?

617
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,120
Well, good news, Travis.

618
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,360
Here is bed.

619
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
That's right, look behind you, it's a box.

620
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,920
I know what you're thinking,

621
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,360
there could never be a bed in there,

622
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,960
but there is, it's a Casper.

623
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
And all you have to do is cut the plastic

624
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
and watch as that beautiful, beautiful mattress expands.

625
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Our listeners are invited to take advantage of Casper's-

626
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
My box is full of worms.

627
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
Why'd you send me a box full of worms, Justin?

628
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
Travis got a bed, I just got like 80 worms.

629
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,920
The worms are-

630
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,760
Part of it.

631
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,720
The worms are-

632
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,760
Dude, that's pumpkins, anybody seen that shit?

633
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,720
You seen this one?

634
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
Google that, guys.

635
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,760
Hey, listen, take it from your man, Jay.

636
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm not going to steer you wrong,

637
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,320
you gotta see this skit.

638
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,080
Forrest Gump's in it, he's wearing this wild suit,

639
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
got pumpkins all over the dang thing,

640
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,520
and he's just going absolutely hog wild

641
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,680
with his two skeleton friends.

642
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,280
You have to see this one, guys.

643
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,960
It's a little bit spooky, but that makes it funnier in a way.

644
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
I know you're worried it's a Halloween skit,

645
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
but there's no killing in this skit.

646
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,560
No killing or cursing.

647
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,000
Any questions?

648
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,520
Oh yeah, that's what I'm going to.

649
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,160
It's good.

650
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,360
This is, a lot of times our advertising company

651
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,240
clips the ads out from the beginning to the end of the ad

652
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
to send them to the advertiser,

653
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
so I hope that they get all of this one.

654
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,680
You can be sure of your purchase of this fantastic bed

655

It is unbelievable.

666
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
Griffin, I want you to read it.

667
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,280
Are you sure?

668
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Hometown boy, I think you deserve this.

669
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,880
No, I do not live in San Antonio though, right?

670
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
You're confused because of the name?

671
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,560
Please, Griffin, read the name.

672
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,480
The name is Joshua Austin.

673
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Okay, so I can kind of understand.

674
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
So Mbem Bambinos who live in the San Antonio area,

675
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,960
there's a hyperlink that we desperately need you to go to.

676
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,520
If you live in San Antonio and you listen to our podcast

677
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,440
and I find out that you didn't go to this hyperlink,

678
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
I will be so, so peeved.

679
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,560
It's www.joshuaaustindds.com.

680
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,760
Mbem Bambinos in the San Antonio area,

681
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,520
you need a good, good dentist.

682
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,200
Check out www.joshuaaustindds.com

683
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,560
for a dentist that vibes it and keeps it tight.

684
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,640
This is a dentist.

685
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
This is a tooth doctor with tools and instruments

686
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,120
and everything that's gonna get into that mouth

687
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,240
close to the nerves

688
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,720
and you're gonna know exactly what kind of fucking

689
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,800
righteous alt comedy that they are into.

690
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,480
Is there anything better than that?

691
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,200
Let me tell you about Joshua Austin.

692
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
Was his dad a dentist?

693
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,360
He was.

694
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,760
He was. You can't buy that sort of thing.

695
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,560
You have to inherit this level of dentistry.

696
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,880
Joshua Austin was named a super dentist by Texas Monthly

697
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,320
in 2014, 2015, 2016, and that's all we know.

698
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,440
So maybe last year didn't quite nail it down.

699
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
A bit of a light year.

700
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,280
A light year for super dentistry from Josh.

701
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,360
That's why he needs you now more than ever.

702
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
Oh, last year he won evil dentist.

703
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,040
Evil dentist.

704
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,000
But he's bringing it back.

705
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,040
San Antonio's best evil dentist is Joshua Austin.

706
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,920
Just catch him.

707
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
Just some stuff I can say about Joshua

708
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
just by looking at the JPEGs on his website.

709
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,960
One, he does own a very powerful, handsome jacket

710
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,160
and let me, yeah, I can confirm, a nice watch.

711
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,520
I bet he takes that off though

712
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,920
before he gets a knuckle deep in the chompers

713
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
to find all the nasty holes

714
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,360
that have the food tucked away inside of them.

715
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,640
Other things I know about him.

716
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
I mean, the smile, it's on point.

717
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,400
It's radiating something and you're gonna like that.

718
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,200
You're gonna see these teeth and know that you're in good mouth.

719
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,720
So go to JoshuaAustinDDS.com now.

720
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,760
I feel like Joshua has broken the seal now of dentists

721
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,120
knowing that they can now get advertisements on our show.

722
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,640
When are we gonna have the perfect

723
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,800
all dentist promotional spot

724
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,640
that's just us talking about some of our favorite dentists?

725
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,640
I think we should do a special episode.

726
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,400
Just for dentists?

727
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,760
They all gotta pay though.

728
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,200
They're all gonna pay.

729
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,560
Oh, he's a human, he's a human dentist for humans, by the way.

730
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,440
We didn't specify he's not for dogs and horses and stuff.

731
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,160
I have a message for Katie

732
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,800
and this message is from Neil

733
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
and it says, this year in lieu of having an arrangement

734
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,400
sent to your office, edible or otherwise,

735
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
I have decided to send you birthday wishes

736
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
via these fine McElroy gentlemen.

737
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,120
I love you more and more each day

738
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,960
and I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you.

739
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

740
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
And I just wanna go ahead and get out in front of this

741
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,960
and say that Katie's birthday was a month ago

742
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,880
so Katie, you know, for the last month

743
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,320
when Neil has been promising you something good's on the way,

744
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,120
that's it, finally here.

745
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,560
Hopefully my dog came through

746
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,120
with just a backup edible arrangement.

747
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,560
Gotta have an edible arrangement.

748
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,880
You always gotta have one on hand, I think.

749
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,680
Also, one more gentlemen we have here.

750
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
This is for Jack from Tess.

751
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,080
Happy, happy birthday, Jack.

752
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,800
You are the best little brother who serves his country,

753
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,120
family and friends so well and I'm so grateful for you.

754
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,240
Introducing me to the McElroys was the best gift ever

755
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
but hopefully this evens the score.

756
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
Enjoy one of the brothers saying go Army, beat Navy

757
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,240
and have the best day ever.

758
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,840
Love and miss you.

759
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,320
I just really wish they would stop making the Army

760
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,840
and Navy fight each other.

761
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,000
It seems so like super dangerous.

762
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,760
It's so wasteful.

763
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Really, really disrespectful.

764
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,040
We need them at their best.

765
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,840
Also, one of them's on the land

766
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,120
and one of them's on the ocean.

767
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,600
That's what I'm saying!

768
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,120
Like, where are they even fighting?

769
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Cause I guess they gotta go-

770
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,120
Like an island?

771
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,520
I think the only fair thing is we get all these folks

772
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,280
in planes and make them do Air Force.

773
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,880
So it's just sort of like a neutral level of experience

774
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,480
but it's just, it seems like-

775
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,600
Why?

776
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,120
Let's get it together.

777
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
Now, I know as a Max Fun listener, you love enamel pins

778
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,680
but guess who were the first people to wear enamel pins?

779
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,600
Everyone in Starfleet.

780
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,840
We talk about him every week on our show,

781
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,280
The Greatest Generation.

782
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Originally about Star Trek The Next Generation,

783
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,280
now we're covering Deep Space Nine.

784
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,200
The main thing we're trying to encourage you to do

785
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,480
is listen to the show.

786
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,000
Listen to the show and know that you are expanding

787
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,040
the community of enamel pin wearing enthusiasts.

788
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,920
You can only resist Big Pin for so long.

789
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,920
So give yourself over to Big Pin and The Greatest Generation

790
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,080
by subscribing and downloading right now.

791
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,160
The Greatest Generation at MaximumFun.org

792
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
or wherever you get your podcasts.

793
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you all want a yahoo from me to you?

794
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,240
Yeah.

795
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,000
This one was also sent in by a lot of people

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
and I don't know if it's very rich, a rich vein,

797
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,480
but it made me think of something

798
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,320
that I thought merited discussion.

799
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
Thank you to everybody who sent this one

800
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,840
and it's by an anonymous user.

801
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,760
I'm gonna call them Shonda asks,

802
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,800
me and my friend both applied for the same job.

803
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
He got the job, but I didn't.

804
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
Can I sue Papa John's?

805
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
Now, I know you're hoping that the job they applied for

806
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,240
was at a Papa John's and not at like their local bank.

807
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
And this person's fury has just blinded them

808
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
and they wanna sue somebody in the first face they see

809
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,360
as the Papa John.

810
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,120
But no, they both applied for Papa John's

811
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,160
and they ended up hiring him, but not me.

812
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,080
I've never been so angry in my life.

813
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,520
Can I sue Papa John's?

814
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,900
Yeah.

815
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,640
Listen, I'm not gonna lie.

816
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,200
Listen, why do we fall, Mr. Bruce?

817
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,640
Why do we fall, Mr. Bruce?

818
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,440
So we can-

819
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,280
Do you want us to continue quoting the movie?

820
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't know what we're doing.

821
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
Yeah, give me the next line,

822
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
because I don't know if it's something about-

823
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,920
So we can get back this.

824
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
So we can apply at Pizza Hut.

825
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
So you can apply at Pizza Hut, Mr. Bruce, that's right.

826
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,520
Now, I would much rather work at the Hut, by the way.

827
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,800
If we're just being straight up,

828
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,840
I'd much rather work at a Domino's.

829
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,400
I wouldn't much rather work at a Pizza Hut.

830
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,160
I would take a Little Caesars.

831
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,520
Other than discriminatory hiring practices,

832
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
which I think is defo-suable,

833
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,480
I don't think you can sue just because you know

834
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,840
your friend Tony is a dumb, like awful piece of shit

835
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,600
and you rule and you're so much cooler than Tony

836
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,680
and there's no way Tony should have gotten this job

837
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,240
and not you.

838
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't know that that argument holds up in the court of law.

839
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,920
What you need to do is when Tony gets sent out on a delivery,

840
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,440
you need to meet him in the parking lot with your own pizza

841
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,080
and you need to beat him to the house

842
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,040
and then call Papa John, send him a selfie,

843
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
say, this is me here at the house,

844
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,080
five minutes before Tony's dumb ass

845
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,760
has even finished fueling up his car,

846
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,640
which he honestly should have done before he was on the clock.

847
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
Anyway, you chose poorly.

848
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,520
Bye.

849
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm very into that.

850
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,520
Very snow crash.

851
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,360
If you can be wearing like a black trench coat

852
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,640
and like Matrix sunglasses

853
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,040
and have a katana when you show up to the house

854
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,480
and you're on like a cool motorcycle,

855
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,160
like that's gonna do it for me.

856
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,960
The thing that popped out to me for this question

857
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
that I just had to float by you boys,

858
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
had to show you this balloon I found,

859
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,760
John Shatter or whatever his name is,

860
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
the founder of Papa John's

861
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,360
and the most fucking just oozing charisma,

862
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,920
the most charismatic commercial man I've ever seen,

863
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,720
I mean, he named his business Papa John's.

864
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,600
Now, don't just jump in here.

865
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Really look at that balloon.

866
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,600
His name is John.

867
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,200
And he said, I'm gonna make pizza so good

868
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,720
that everyone's gonna call me Papa, Papa.

869
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,080
They're gonna, I like it when you call me Papa John

870
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,800
because I'm making you do it

871
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,240
every time you call my business

872
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,960
and you say, is this Papa John's?

873
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,680
And I'm wire tapped in and I'm like, oh, nice.

874
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,680
Hi, I need to order.

875
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,120
Think about what he was getting started.

876
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,080
Hi, this is John.

877
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,520
Well, I'd like to order a pizza.

878
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,400
From who?

879
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,200
From you, John.

880
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,280
Gotta say it.

881
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
From Papa John.

882
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,360
Yeah, what do you want now?

883
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,320
It's just unbelievable to me.

884
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,920
Naming things is hard.

885
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,120
I get it, I get it.

886
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,360
But when we were naming this podcast,

887
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,240
the name Daddy Griffin never even crossed my mind.

888
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,120
It could have been cool

889
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
if the podcast the three of us do

890
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
and have been doing for eight years

891
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,320
was just called Daddy Griffin.

892
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,520
But it just seems strange to me.

893
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,920
The name of my business is Papa.

894
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,880
Nobody in his life had ever called him Papa John

895
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,560
ever to that point, I bet.

896
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
There's no way this was a nickname.

897
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,800
And even if it was, it's a bit presumptuous

898
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,640
to make your nickname the name of your pizza place.

899
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,360
Anyway, you probably shouldn't sue.

900
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah, I don't think you can sue.

901
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,160
No, not sue.

902
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
You're just gonna have to start a rival business

903
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,760
and put them out of business.

904
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,080
Yes.

905
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,840
Daddy Tyler's pizza and things.

906
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,040
Pizza and things.

907
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:47,840
What?

908
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,480
Oh, shit.

909
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,600
So much food in this episode.

910
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,480
It is a very food happy episode.

911
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
I want a much squad.

912
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,800
I want too much squad.

913
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,880
Dunkin Donuts launches donut fries across America.

914
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
Jesus Christ, Justin.

915
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,880
You gotta give me some build up into it.

916
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,600
You can't just fucking vert ramp off into it

917
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,960
like right from the get go.

918
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,120
Dunkin Donuts fries just ahead of the 4th of July holiday.

919
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,240
Dunkin Donuts is bringing donut fries across America.

920
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,600
What on earth could those two ideas have in common?

921
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,880
What on earth are those two ideas overlapping with?

922
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,560
Are America, I guess, following a successful test

923
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,960
earlier this year, Dunkin Donuts announced-

924
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,520
Yeah.

925
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,120
We've done it.

926
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,560
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

927
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,520
We put the fucking scientific method to this one, okay?

928
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,120
Dunkin Donuts announced it will now bring new donut fries

929
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,280
to guests all throughout the country.

930
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
Available for a limited time at-

931
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,800
Listen, is it good or not?

932
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
At participating Dunkin Donuts restaurants nationwide

933
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,840
beginning Monday, July 2nd.

934
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,240
This newest snack serves, I mean, it's what you think it is.

935
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,880
It serves a sweet spin on classic fries,

936
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,360
creating a fun, easy to eat way to enjoy the delight of donuts.

937
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,840
What?

938
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,080
So notoriously hard to eat this whole time

939
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,000
while on the go any time of day.

940
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,280
Donut fries feature individual pieces of delicious,

941
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,720
buttery croissant-style donut dough

942
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,920
that are tossed in cinnamon sugar and served warm

943
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
with just the right amount of crisp.

944
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,520
Okay, okay, okay.

945
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160
Does it come with frosting you can dip it in?

946
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,680
Uh, no.

947
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
What the fuck, guys?

948
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,160
I know.

949
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,360
We made donut pizza.

950
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,880
Is there any kind of sauce or anything?

951
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,200
No, it's just a big, round, flat donut.

952
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,320
What the fuck, guys?

953
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,560
You can't set yourself up like that and drop the ball.

954
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,080
You can't set yourself up like that and drop the ball.

955
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,920
They are gonna start having ketchup.

956
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,120
Dunkin' Donuts tested donut fries at a small number of locations

957
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,000
in the Boston and Providence markets earlier this year.

958
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,520
According to Tony Wiseman,

959
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,960
chief marketing officer of Dunkin' Donuts US,

960
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,960
okay, as America's donut leader,

961
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,120
we put our passion and creativity

962
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,120
towards finding fun and unexpected ways

963
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,520
to please and surprise donut fans.

964
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,800
You're the leader of, if you're the leader of donuts,

965
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,040
shouldn't you be operating with a modicum of responsibility?

966
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,800
Shouldn't you at some point, like,

967
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,600
try to blaze a trail for other donuts?

968
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,880
At the very least, if you're trying to please donut fans,

969
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,480
make fucking donuts.

970
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,760
Make a good donut.

971
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,880
Don't make these tiny donut sticks without dipping.

972
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
I've never been, this is fucked up

973
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,280
because I've never been so angry that this idea

974
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,640
of the Munch Squad isn't nastier than it already is.

975
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,000
You know what I mean?

976
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,960
I will say I'm looking at a picture of these donut fries.

977
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,040
They are not fry scale.

978
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,480
They are like big hunks of donuts.

979
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
They're donut sticks, which has been a thing forever.

980
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
Listen, I need to finish this paragraph

981
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,640
because I've never,

982
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,080
we have a lot of fun with the English language here,

983
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,760
the Munch Squad, this one's out there.

984
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
There was a strong consumer response

985
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,240
towards bringing donut fries to all Americans

986
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,600
during the initial test.

987
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,440
What?

988
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,480
What does that mean?

989
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,160
Hey, come again?

990
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,560
There was a strong consumer response

991
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,680
towards bringing donut fries to all Americans

992
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,720
during the initial test.

993
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,600
So what Tony is suggesting here

994
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,120
is that some fine Bostonians went to their table,

995
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,560
enjoyed their donut fries,

996
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,960
then sprinted back up to the counter and was like,

997
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,840
oh, oh, oh, you have to get this to everyone.

998
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,360
Everyone deserves this.

999
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,600
This, I can't just keep this for myself.

1000
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
Tony, I hate to point this out,

1001
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,480
but just saying a strong response,

1002
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,080
that could go either way.

1003
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah, that's how it hit me.

1004
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,080
It's like when you go into a bathroom,

1005
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,680
you smell a smell so bad that you need,

1006
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,160
you know, everyone in the country see the shining,

1007
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,000
shining seed and come in and smell it too.

1008
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
These are so nasty.

1009
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,560
I need everyone to eat them

1010
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
because they're not gonna believe me.

1011
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,560
Or like someone could take a bite and be like,

1012
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,080
you're gonna give these to everyone?

1013
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,120
You can't.

1014
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,040
Can't wait to see this.

1015
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,320
Don't do it.

1016
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
I'm having a strong response

1017
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,120
at the idea of you trying to give these to other people.

1018
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
I just real quick also wanna mention

1019
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,360
that Dunkin' Donuts, according to this press release,

1020
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,120
has a new shark bite donut.

1021
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
It's a feeding frenzy for donut fans

1022
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,440
who can now put their jaws around this new donut

1023
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,200
featuring white icing and special shark shaped sprinkles.

1024
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,760
I'm leading this American donut lover to ask why.

1025
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,400
Hey, wait, I heard the whole sentence.

1026
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,840
Why?

1027
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,200
Because what I heard from you is

1028
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,440
it's got white icing and special shark shaped sprinkles.

1029
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,720
What am I, four?

1030
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,800
Why?

1031
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,440
Why did you do that?

1032
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
Why did you do that?

1033
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,280
Why did you do the shark bite donut?

1034
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,240
I don't understand.

1035
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,000
I thought for sure the shark bite donut

1036
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,720
would just kind of be a hack where you walk up

1037
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,600
and you say, yeah, let me get the raspberry jelly filled.

1038
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,320
Just one of those.

1039
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,160
I just, you know, I want a little snack

1040
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,920
and my blood sugar's running a little low.

1041
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,600
Can I get that shark bite style?

1042
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,160
And the cashier says, oh yeah, sure.

1043
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,760
And they pick it up out of the counter and they go,

1044
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,640
and then they take a big old juicy jelly filled bite of that

1045
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,920
and just hand it right over.

1046
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,280
Oh no, the shark got it.

1047
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,000
I would not recommend finishing that.

1048
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,360
It is not very good.

1049
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,440
So anyway, that's your update.

1050
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,680
I just, the shark bite donut, why?

1051
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,840
I don't understand why.

1052
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,880
Why did it happen?

1053
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,280
Yeah.

1054
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,000
How about a yahoo?

1055
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,440
I got a lot of really good ones.

1056
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,640
Yeah, I guess.

1057
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,920
Well, is there a good question?

1058
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,960
No, it's not.

1059
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,560
Sorry, I'm kind of dejected.

1060
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,240
Also, I found a picture of a shark bite donut

1061
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,200
they did in 2014.

1062
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,320
It looks like a life preserver.

1063
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,040
That's the thing.

1064
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,080
No, it's kind of fun.

1065
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,440
But this is different now

1066
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,760
because it's just white with shark sprinkles on it.

1067
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,680
So is this just all the middles

1068
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
they have left over from the life preserver donuts?

1069
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,520
Presumably, yeah.

1070
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,720
Here is a yahoo sent in by Han Malik.

1071
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,280
Thank you, Han.

1072
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,160
It's yahoo answers user question mark.

1073
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,600
Jesus, Papa John asks,

1074
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,360
how can I stop YouTube from recommending

1075
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,960
Super Mario gaming for me?

1076
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,480
I hate Super Mario.

1077
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,360
And no matter what,

1078
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,600
I keep getting recommendation about these videos.

1079
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,080
I click dislike and say, not interested.

1080
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,360
I don't like the video.

1081
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,920
But I still get anything Super Mario

1082
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,120
on my recommended list.

1083
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,600
This happens to me on Netflix

1084
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,320
where everything I watch,

1085
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,520
Netflix is like,

1086
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,440
do you want to watch some Frasier now?

1087
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,240
And I'm like, why?

1088
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,840
We got lots of Frasier clips.

1089
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,440
Listen, here's the thing, right?

1090
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,200
I get it because I did just finish

1091
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,960
watching another episode of Frasier.

1092
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,840
And it's like, do you want to watch more Frasier?

1093
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,880
And I'm like, yes.

1094
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,600
But you were hate watching it

1095
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,720
and everybody knew it

1096
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,920
because you were laughing like,

1097
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,600
can you fucking believe this family?

1098
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,280
They're so out of touch.

1099
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,320
Well, and that's the thing is like,

1100
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,240
when I searched Netflix for like 90 sitcoms

1101
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,640
about radio psychologists,

1102
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,400
I wasn't looking for Frasier.

1103
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,520
And so then I was like,

1104
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,120
you think I want to watch this shit?

1105
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,280
And so I watched like 20 episodes of it

1106
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
just to prove Netflix wrong.

1107
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,080
Yeah, I hate the Plumber Mario.

1108
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,680
And yet somehow every time I get on YouTube

1109
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,280
to watch some of my favorite vids

1110
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,240
from some of my favorite vloggers,

1111
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,280
he's always there.

1112
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,680
And he always wants me to watch all of his videos.

1113
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,120
Maybe you could search out some videos

1114
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,040
of like Mario getting killed.

1115
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,840
You know what I mean?

1116
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,880
Like Mario catches a fireball right in his dick

1117
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,400
over and over again,

1118
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,640
like a super cut of Mario dying.

1119
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,160
And then YouTube will be like,

1120
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,440
oh, you hate Mario.

1121
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
Yeah, some of those super funny,

1122
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,120
like Newgrounds mid-90s Mario violence videos

1123
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,160
where like Mario and Luigi getting a big gun fight.

1124
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,560
And then it ends with like Mario dodging

1125
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,280
a bunch of his bullets.

1126
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,040
But then Luigi's right there and he's like,

1127
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,680
dodge this.

1128
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,360
And he shoots him right in the fucking face.

1129
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,080
And you're like, it's really fucking funny

1130
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,120
because it's Mario.

1131
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,320
Because it's 1996.

1132
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,800
And like, we're all still trying to figure it out.

1133
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,880
I like Mario.

1134
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,560
Okay.

1135
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,440
I mean, I'm just saying I find him pleasant.

1136
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:23,680
Yeah.

1137
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,480
These days, video games with their fast cars

1138
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,600
and their loud music

1139
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,920
and they keep having all these like punk characters.

1140
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Have you guys played the fast car video game?

1141
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,840
The Tracy Chapman fast car game adaptation.

1142
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,320
It was unofficially in,

1143
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,480
it was the developers of Need for Speed.

1144
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,680
But they went ahead and they were like,

1145
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,920
we have a lot of fast cars.

1146
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,080
And they approached Tracy and were like,

1147
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,680
do you want us to just use some of these

1148
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,280
for the fast car game?

1149
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,800
And Tracy Chapman was like,

1150
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,760
yeah, I guess so.

1151
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,000
Seems like a weird fit.

1152
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,920
Have you all ever made a song video game before?

1153
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,560
You're like, well, no.

1154
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,040
Because there hasn't been a song called fast car before.

1155
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
And that's kind of like our whole thing.

1156
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,400
If you were going to make Tracy Chapman team racing

1157
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,600
and it's a car racer,

1158
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,960
always set to Tracy Chapman's fast car.

1159
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,640
But all Tracy Chapman's friends are in the game.

1160
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,400
Who would you put into like-

1161
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,600
Stephen Curtis.

1162
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Sorry, you'd put Stephen Curtis Chapman

1163
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,120
in the Tracy Chapman racing game.

1164
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,560
You'd put contemporary Christian artist

1165
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,760
Stephen Curtis Chapman

1166
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,360
in the Tracy Chapman video game.

1167
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,480
I was going to say like,

1168
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,320
I would put-

1169
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,440
Tracy Allman.

1170
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,400
Desiree in there.

1171
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
Tracy Allman would be a great fit.

1172
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,800
I feel like Lisa Loeb would be an unlockable character.

1173
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,680
I feel like Lisa Loeb you'd be able to unlock for sure.

1174
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,880
And then like the whole game is,

1175
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,080
I think pretty short.

1176
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,440
Because you don't have to drive too far.

1177
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
You just got to cross the border into the city.

1178
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,760
And then if you win, you both get jobs

1179
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,080
and finally see what it means to be living.

1180
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,880
And you will know that that's like the final cut scene.

1181
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,880
And Tracy Chapman comes out and, you know, sings.

1182
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
I mean, it can't fit a lot on it

1183
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,120
because I'm imagining this is like a PlayStation 1 game.

1184
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,280
And so like the video quality is going to be really,

1185
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,360
like 140 pixels of just pure Tracy Chapman singing

1186
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,160
while a very fast car speeds into the background,

1187
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,480
picking up bonuses and power ups and stuff.

1188
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,080
Fuck, this would be a really good game.

1189
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,360
Did you not see Griffin?

1190
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,680
E3, there's a big release from Bethesda.

1191
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,840
I mean, it's not, it's going to be on the next gen console,

1192
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,960
but they're bringing it back.

1193
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,720
They're bringing back Fast Car 6?

1194
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,360
Yeah, this one, it takes,

1195
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,640
you can customize your car.

1196
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,400
You can customize your Tracy Chapman.

1197
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,120
Graphics still look pretty much the same.

1198
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,960
They didn't change.

1199
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,560
And the song is of course still the same.

1200
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,280
But story seems a lot more beefed up.

1201
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
You know, when's Tracy Chapman going to come out

1202
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,320
with a new fast car, right?

1203
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,760
Faster car, faster car.

1204
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,000
It kicks the ass of that last car.

1205
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,600
We thought that car was fast,

1206
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,120
but this one's so fucking fast.

1207
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,360
You won't believe how fast this one is.

1208
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,600
You're going to shit your pants

1209
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,320
when you see how fast a faster car goes.

1210
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,000
We got to make a decision.

1211
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,640
Take that slow dumb car, this new faster one.

1212
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,840
It's not a decision.

1213
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,480
This one's so much faster, idiot.

1214
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,680
It's got a Hemi.

1215
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,360
I think that's important.

1216
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,800
I don't know, but I paid extra.

1217
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,400
Got that nitrous.

1218
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,440
Does it have nitrous?

1219
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,560
What a dumb question.

1220
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,840
Of course it does.

1221
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,960
Press the button.

1222
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,160
Let's get the fuck out of here and rob a bank.

1223
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,040
Rob a bank.

1224
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,480
Rob 80 banks and crush a bank.

1225
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,840
We got to get baby driver.

1226
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,800
Drive this car so fast.

1227
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,680
Drive this car off a building.

1228
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
Drive it straight into another building.

1229
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,280
I, I, I, my car just transformed into a robot.

1230
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,800
Didn't I mention it does that?

1231
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,840
It does that.

1232
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,800
It does that.

1233
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,800
The rock just punched a torpedo into a slower car,

1234
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,560
but that's okay.

1235
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,640
That car was so unlike a faster car.

1236
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,440
Somebody get Tracy on the phone.

1237
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,720
You know that new song you've been looking for?

1238
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,760
Listen to this.

1239
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,000
Why didn't I ever think of faster car?

1240
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,520
Of course.

1241
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,200
Coming soon.

1242
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,480
Fastest car.

1243
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,000
Oh man, let's really take, we've had a long time to enjoy fast car.

1244
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,800
I don't want to just skip right over faster car.

1245
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,240
Faster car is really good.

1246
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,160

This one's asked by Tavis who asks,

1293
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,760
Does Mr. Peanut need that monocle?

1294
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,520
Or is it just a fashion statement?

1295
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,480

Welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

So far, the world's most boring wrestling podcast has been destroying the competition.

1307
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,120
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

1308
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,760
