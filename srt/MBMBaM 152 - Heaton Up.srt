1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era. My name

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,080
is Justin McElroy, and I've brought the two of you here because I have some big news.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:02,400
Hit me with your rhythm stick. I am going to be a mother. Justin.

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,840
I am. God, so many emotions running through my mind and my heart right now. I'm flabbergasted.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,960
I would say the overwhelming emotional feeling is confusion. Is confusion an emotion?

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
I have a lot of that, but it's overridden slightly by excitement.

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:28,640
Thanks, Trudy. Mainly I'm bringing this up. I waited until today. Obviously, I just want you

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,200
guys to treat me super special today. Just really super duper special. How far along are you?

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
Four or five, I feel like. You're four or five along?

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
Which trimester is that? I think it's one of them,

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
definitely. One of the big ones that everybody really likes to have. Have you been practicing,

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,480
you know, Pilates? Spreading it. Kegels? Pilates, Kegels. Here's the secret. You don't want to do

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,920
Kegels. You do not want it tight down there. You want it limber. You want it loose. You want to do

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
anti-Kegels. You want to be loosey. You know, I had an anti-Kegel once. You know, I had a

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,200
spaceship powered by anti-Kegels. Really? Yeah, it was the logistical improbability of them

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,240
was enough to make the ship go. Listen, guys, I just really, the main thing for me is that you

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,040
just treat me really nice. And even if on the off chance I never bring up being a mother again,

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
can't imagine that happening. Now, Justin, what would you say to your haters that might accuse

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,960
you of just trying to capitalize on the Mother's Day attention? Gosh, that is so like the younger

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:50,080
generation, you know? Yeah. You know, the kids, they're just all, they're all plugged in. And

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm really, part of being a mom that you have to understand, Travis, I suspect, is that when the

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,240
young, when the younger generation doesn't, basically where there was one set of footprints

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,640
in the sand is where I carry them. Okay. So there's, it's all jealousy, right? Like that time

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
article on millennials, like it really, it touches on that point a lot how this, this generation of

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,520
human beings doesn't have the male uterus. You know what I mean? They can't carry, men can't

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,880
carry a human being to term in this particular generation. That's right. I do not know why.

31
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,440
It's like children of men. Literally, it's exactly literally like children of men. Oh my God, what if

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,160
they did a sequel to that movie and they did a mashup with that, with Junior, with the Arnold

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,040
Schwarzenegger movie where he gets pregnant? That would be, that's how I'm a mom. I meant to tell you

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,160
also, I have Junior disease. You saw the movie or whatever it was. He's got Junior disease.

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,960
I have Junior, Junior disease that makes a baby throw at you. I got Junior. I caught secondhand

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Junior from watching my laser. I was watching my laser disc of Junior and I caught secondhand Junior

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and now I'm a male mom, a manther, if you will. Is that like a panther? I won't. It's like a panther.

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,120
Well, if my cubs are in danger, it is. My babies, my single baby, maybe two babies. Oh, I'm a single

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,160
baby. Justin, is it disheartening though? Cause you've lost so much weight this year that you're

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,520
just going to put on. Just putting it right back on that baby fat. Well, it's important. It's, you

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,280
know, I won't mind knowing that my baby is just reaching up with his fat little fetus hand and

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,600
grabbing globules of that fat and eating it for nourishment. I won't feel so bad about it. I want

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
him to have a good food supply. That is how, that is how it works. It's like a bowl weevil in a

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,160
watermelon. Just emptying it out. It's like James, you got, it's basically a James and the Giant

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,440
Peach scenario. Yeah. I'd like to make a name recommendation, please. Baby fat. Okay. It's a

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,560
little unknown. You're saying that you're saying the thing that it is to you biologically speaking

47
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,520
in a biological context, that baby is nothing but an extra eight pounds that you have to,

48
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,920
that you have to transport for a while. I think it fits. So make sure the two of you,

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,800
did you introduce yourselves? I mean, obviously it's not our special, it's not our special day.

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
You know what I mean? I would prefer you did not introduce yourselves. If that's,

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
if that's, that's fine. Yeah. It's your, it's we can give you that from other stuff.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah. Thank you. Uh, let's, uh, let's do, I do want to help other people though.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,040
And that's really what being a mom's all about for me is just, gosh, just never stop it. It's

54
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,240
like being, it's just being pecked to death by ducks, right? It's like being pecked to death

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,440
by ducks. How do I respond to complainers? I often find myself at the receiving end of some sort of

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
rant. People were accounting bad customer service experiences, ways their friends have slighted

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,880
them and so on. What's the best way to react? Complaining is a pet peeve of mine, but I don't

58
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,160
want to be rude. Do I agree with them? Stay neutral. I try to be noncommittal and let them vent,

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,640
but I'm worried my annoyance shows through. What should I do? That's from complained out

60
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,200
incarnation. It's a nice name for a town carnation. It is nice. It is nice. Um,

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,800
too bad everything sucks there. Apparently carnation, the negativity capital of the world.

62
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,320
I, yeah, apparently everybody's grumped. I'm right there with this part. They're not, oh God,

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,800
nobody gives a shit. Nobody gives a shit about the poor service you received unless it's hilarious.

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Yeah, that's, that's sort of my MO is I, I seriously, I never complain unless I can like

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,880
tie some sort of entertainment. Like I want people to hear about how hard my life is, but I know that

66
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't want to put upon them the, the boring ass stuff that people have done to slight me. So I'll

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,640
work a goof in there or two. You know what I mean? Even if you have to make one up, because also I

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,240
find, especially when it comes to like customer service things and stuff, someone's going to be

69
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,840
like, and she, it took like 10 minutes to get it done. Like all I'm sitting there thinking is,

70
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,920
well, maybe it was a really complicated thing or they were really busy and you're just whining

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,000
for no reason. Like there's always a certain amount of like perspective on it that makes the

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,640
person seem just like a whiner. You should tell them, you should make them watch. This is water

73
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,920
is this video I watched or any, any, any number of, of Netflix documentaries. How about dear,

74
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,440
how about dear Zachary? Oh man. Oh shit. Oh man. They served me my coffee and it was lukewarm when

75
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,960
it got to the table. Oh man. Well, at least your dad's alive. You should keep a, you should keep

76
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,720
a series of pictures in your pocket at all times of like the Chilean miners emerging or like that

77
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,320
lady they saved from the rebel, rebel of the Bangladesh factory after being buried alive for

78
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,200
14 days or what have you just slow as their story continues, just slowly start edging it up over the

79
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,080
lip of the table. Just slow. Oh, you can do a little fun little, you can do a little fun little

80
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,000
thing where you pretend that is the Chilean miners emerging, emerging from below and be like, Oh,

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
and you can do like a fun voice. You can do like a fun voice like, Oh, you had to wait at the DMV

82
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,240
for how long we waited in the underground frigid caverns, which is like a DMV, I guess.

83
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,240
Did you just curious, did you have to eat your underwear at any point? Was that part of your,

84
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,320
no. Okay. All right. We're the tiny Chilean miners that live under this table and we're here to tell

85
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:48,480
you that you need to chill the fuck out. Um, yeah, there's no, you don't think any

86
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,680
complainers listen to our podcast, do you? No. Well, no, I know for a fact some do.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,440
Anytime the goofs, the goofs get a little dry. When the goofs fall fast. We might get an email

88
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,120
from a Chilean miner. We go to the old goof well sometimes there ain't nothing but dust in there.

89
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,160
And man, do we ever hear about it? Well, it's like being a farmer and people saying that you

90
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
got spots in your tomatoes when you're in the market. Like, I know it's been a dry season.

91
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
We need to start replying to those tweets, pictures of the Chilean miners.

92
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,800
From now on, if you complain about our show, that's what you get. You get a JPEG, a low res

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,880
JPEG of the Chilean miners. They would have loved that entertainment. Even the bad episodes,

94
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,840
they would love it. They would conquer the language barrier. I think they would connect

95
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
with something. Well, they could listen to the Spanish language version of her. The guy that

96
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:50,880
does Travis's voice is out of control. That's Travis because he's eating two hamburgers.

97
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Necesito un bocadillo. I mean, I need a big sandwich.

98
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
Exactly. All of these things are things that Travis has said today,

99
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,240
and it's 10.14 in the morning. Travis has eaten two hamburgers and a giant sandwich,

100
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,400
and it's 10.14 in the morning. Yo soy Alphonse.

101
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:23,760
That's one of the few sentences I know. That's not even the Fonz's classic catchphrase.

102
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
He often would just go places and state for a fact that he was the Fonz.

103
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,560
Hello, yes, I am the Fonz. Hey, let me just bump this soda machine real quick. Oh, hurt my elbow.

104
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,400
I would love to watch an episode where Fonz was ineffectual.

105
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,560
He's actually trying to get a table at Arnold's, and he just has to loudly announce,

106
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,520
I am the Fonz. Can I drop a truth bomb on you guys real quick? Something I want to think about.

107
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,120
Sure. Okay, so welcome to Travis's Pondering Corner.

108
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,400
Oh god, is it going to be entertaining at all, or is this something I'm just going to have to

109
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,120
edit out of the show? I think so. Okay. If you hear 40 seconds of silence, you know what happens.

110
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,240
As I was listening, as I was going through the emails last night, we got an email from Robin,

111
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,360
and Robin made an excellent point that we have a tendency to use phrases like man up or nut up or

112
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
something along those lines. I don't think I say nut up ever.

113
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,760
I don't think I've ever said nut up. What about sack up?

114
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,480
No, these are all things I don't think I'd say. Grow a dick?

115
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Grow a dick? Grow a dick is something I've never even heard Fled Lode said.

116
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,840
So, the phrase man up. I do think it's kind of funny.

117
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,160
I don't like these phrases anymore, and so now I was thinking about it,

118
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
and I came up with a phrase that I would like to enter into the lexicon to start using.

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
Okay. Power up.

120
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,960
Power up? Yeah, so when someone's like,

121
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,800
I want to ask a girl out, but I'm too nervous, you say power up and do it.

122
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Can we say power up? What about genitals?

123
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
How about genitals up? Or just-

124
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
Ginny up. Gin's up.

125
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,280
Gin's up, everybody. What's wrong?

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,200
What about Ginny up? I like Ginny up because that says,

127
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,760
no matter what your genitals are, just find them.

128
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,520
Just find the power of your vagina or penis. Ginny up.

129
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,920
I kind of like Ginny up. Ginny up, everybody.

130
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
All right, that's in it now. Let's get it on some shirts.

131
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Let's t-shirt it. T-shirt it.

132
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,640
Tweet it, Facebook it. But I'm afraid to Facebook it.

133
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,200
Our Deedles campaign did not catch on. Because I edited it out completely.

134
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,360
I edited every utterance of Deedles from the last episode completely out of the show.

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,920
You freed the Deedles from the Disney vault campaign, you edited it out?

136
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, and I'm going to get it this time too. You're terrible.

137
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
No, it's way better if you leave it in this time.

138
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
Okay, I'll leave it in this time. To let people think about what might have been.

139
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,960
To let people know that the fucking Dead Sea Scrolls of episode 151

140
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,400
buried in a cave somewhere where we talk about the hit Disney film Meet the Deedles.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,000
Free the Deedles.

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,280
Free the Deedles. Hashtag Deedles.

143
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Good, good, good comedy. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

144
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,400
Please, anything.

145
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
It's Drew. It's by Yahoo. It's user Nick who asks,

147
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
My mom took my swag. How do I steal it back?

148
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,920
Yeah, like a month ago, my mom caught me chiefing a cig.

149
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,960
She then took all my snapbacks and proceeded to tell me that she took my swag.

150
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,160
At first it seemed a little stupid, but now I no longer feel the urge to smoke cigs

151
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,560
or wear bulls' snapbacks. How do I steal the swag back?

152
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,040
Hold on.

153
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
A snapback is a type of hat with a basketball logo on it.

154
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,360
Thank you.

155
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
I Google image searched it.

156
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:57,920
Thank you very much.

157
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,360
And what is chiefing a cig?

158
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,640
That is when you smoke a cigarette with your butt. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know.

159
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,680
I assume it's smoking. It's just a cool thing that we don't know about because we're old now.

160
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay.

161
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,760
Okay. So you've never heard of like having having a chief having a chief.

162
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh, I'm I'm going to step outside of this bar and just have a chief.

163
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,280
No.

164
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
Have a have a long chief or a chuff.

165
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
Can I get a chief off your your cigarette friend?

166
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,560
No, you can have no chiefs.

167
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
Um, kind of achieve his mom is like his mom is like mentalist in him, right?

168
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
I don't even know. I don't know what he has ever watched the mentalist.

169
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

170
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Sorry, you guys. Lots of people have watched the mentalist me 40 year old women.

171
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
Lots of people.

172
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,080
So can you explain what you mean though?

173
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760
Mentalist thing is when the mentalist says a word or phrase and you're like,

174
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,400
uh, whatever, but then it creeps in your consciousness.

175
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,960
And like two days later you call him back and you're like,

176
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
yeah, I'm ready to tell you everything.

177
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
You need to that's inception.

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,480
That's it.

179
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,360
Call it inception.

180
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,200
That's a way bigger blockbuster smash.

181
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
Inception happens in dreams.

182
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
You guys mentalist thing happens in real life.

183
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,200
Did you guys see that Christopher Nolan movie?

184
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,840
It came back.

185
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,240
It came out a few years ago because I saw it in Chicago.

186
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,520
That was like 2011.

187
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
It was called Mentalisters.

188
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
It was called Mentalisters.

189
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,400
And it was about people who mentalist each other by going into their psyches.

190
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm just tired of Travis trying to gerund every CBS series.

191
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,800
I know.

192
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
He tried to do so.

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,080
He tried to get Survivoring going forever.

194
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,040
That didn't work out.

195
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
He tried to get NCIS Los Angeles thing going.

196
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
That did not work out.

197
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm just sick of it.

198
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,120
I want you guys to know that I've actually just mentalistic you.

199
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,240
And like two weeks from now someone will say something like,

200
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,200
oh, like mentalist thing.

201
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,680
Travis, you are not the origin of nearly as many zeitgeists as you think you are.

202
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,760
Maybe I am.

203
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay.

204
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,480
In two weeks we're going to realize that Travis is the origin of every zeitgeist.

205
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,520
Two possible scenarios for this situation.

206
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,720
Either the mom took his swag away to punish him.

207
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,760
Or because she's trying to rekindle the flame of her youth.

208
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,240
Trying to fucking throw on some snapbacks and chief a few puffers.

209
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,360
I see.

210
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,280
So mom wants mom wants swag for a day.

211
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
Mom wants the feels.

212
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,480
Oh my god, the new ABC Family hit movie, Swag for a Day.

213
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
I was going to say Patricia Heaton.

214
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,040
How did you know?

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
Because I mentalist-ed you.

216
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh god damn it.

217
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
The middle ding ding us.

218
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Yeah, it's Patricia Heaton.

219
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
She takes her son's cigs, takes his bulls cap, throws it on.

220
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
Goes to the mall, smokes in the mall.

221
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Security guard's like, you can't smoke in a mall.

222
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,600
She's like, I can.

223
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,240
I gave birth.

224
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
And then, because I'm a mother.

225
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,360
And then he's like, I think I love you.

226
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
And then they fall in love.

227
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
It's a prequel to the middle.

228
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,920
We also on this program, I'm trying desperately to picture this scenario, this movie.

229
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,600
Mainly so I can remember it later.

230
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
And write it down and sell it.

231
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,880
But we on this show have proven ourselves incapable of distinguishing Patricia Heaton

232
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
from the mom on Home Improvement.

233
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,480
We used, we have on many occasions used these two women interchangeably.

234
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
Who is the mom on Home Improvement?

235
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
Patricia Cheefin.

236
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,920
The evil twin of Patricia Heaton.

237
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
Or the good twin.

238
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,360
I've heard some negative things about Patricia Heaton.

239
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
Patricia Richardson.

240
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,280
Okay, see, these are not the same women.

241
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,960
Even though every other sign would point to them being the same person.

242
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,680
Well, one is a, sorry, one is a complete neocon psychopath.

243
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,360
Wait, really?

244
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,600
Yeah.

245
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,120
Which one?

246
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,560
Patricia Heaton, I would say, is not a friend to the gay community.

247
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,480
You're kidding me.

248
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,760
I just saw her yesterday.

249
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
She seemed so nice.

250
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,080
But Griffin, everybody loves Gaiman.

251
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,880
Oh my god, did you guys know that the BBC ordered an everybody loves Raymond remake?

252
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,040
Everyone cares deeply for Raymond.

253
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's get back to the heart of the matter.

254
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
By the way, this question was posted in Etiquette.

255
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600
This is a proper, polite way of asking my mom for my swag back.

256
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,760
I don't think you can, I don't think the hat doesn't make the swag.

257
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,880
I think we all know that, right?

258
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
No, no, it helps.

259
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
It does help, but it is a swag modifier.

260
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
But the swag has to bloom from within.

261
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,800
Right, the swag starts in your heart when you accept Jesus Christ into your life.

262
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,840
Mm-hmm, and you accept his love and forgiveness for all your-

263
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
You got a swag filled hole that only Jesus can fill.

264
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Right.

265
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,360
Jesus is the ultimate swag.

266
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,040
You look at like 2 Chainz, Feral, Feral, have you heard this rapper Feral?

267
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,360
He has a sample on the Daft Punk track, and it's just him eating a deer.

268
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
We're up all night to eat garbage.

269
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,760
We're up all night to bite babies.

270
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
We're up all night to foam at the mouth.

271
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,560
We can't pay Daft Punk any more royalties for that song, unfortunately.

272
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,240
Yeah, next question, here we go.

273
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,120
At in my, oh, man, if this was at Mother's Day, you guys would have given me such a hard time

274
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
for missing that read up.

275
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,920
Here, let me try again.

276
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,800
At my college, there is a girl I really like.

277
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,240
I met her once at the beginning of the semester, but didn't get her name,

278
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
and recently saw her in the library and approached her.

279
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
Besides coming off a bit strong, I don't really like her.

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,240
We got on well, and I asked her if we could have coffee sometime, to which she agreed.

281
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
She then added me on Facebook.

282
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,560
When I checked out her profile, though, it said she was interested in women, not men.

283
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Should I trust this and give up on her?

284
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,880
Advances of romance or ask her out and hope for the best?

285
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
That's from confused Facebooker in Bandura.

286
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,920
We are, I don't know, guys, about this one.

287
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,160
We are so unqualified.

288
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,480
We are on perhaps the thinnest ice of our career on this one.

289
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
I, I'm willing to skate on it and just plunge right through.

290
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
Well, yeah, can I just, this feels like a stumper to me.

291
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
Can I just, this feels like a stumper to me.

292
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
This feels like I'm-

293
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm worried that we may say something accidentally that will

294
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
make this episode palatable only to Patricia Heaton, if that makes sense.

295
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
No, I mean, like, I don't, I mean, I really, I honestly,

296
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,960
I feel like I've reached the event horizon of my, my ability to put myself into a situation.

297
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
There are just so many twists and turns on this one.

298
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,960
I don't, I don't know.

299
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,680
Let's, let's start with the, with some of the codified parameters of this question.

300
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,920
Let's start with some of the heuristics.

301
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,840
For instance, on Facebook, it says she's interested in women, but for what?

302
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
You know, for friendship?

303
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,240
For companionship?

304
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,040
Because that's, that is a possibility to checkmark on Facebook, but probably not.

305
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,360
Probably not at all.

306
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
Probably not that at all.

307
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,720
Okay, I'm going to say this, and because this is a zone of friendship and safety,

308
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
as all internet is.

309
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
No, we are in the fucking danger zone right now.

310
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
This is our fucking Kobayashi Maru, Travis.

311
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,840
What ruined this was about like, uh, six or eight years ago.

312
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
This really stupid trend of people claiming they were married to their best friends.

313
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,320
You're saying that this person put that as their Facebook status as a goof

314
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
and then forgot to change it.

315
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,400
No, no, no.

316
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm saying that it muddied the water and made it, made people unable to trust

317
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
what they see on Facebook.

318
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,560
Okay.

319
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,000
Because there was this seed planted eight years ago of like,

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
well, people joke around on Facebook all the time.

321
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
Okay, I know, I do know what Travis is saying.

322
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,480
I don't know that that's, I mean, I don't know that that's particularly helpful.

323
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
No, I don't think so either, but I'm saying there's no,

324
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,240
that's what allows someone to see that interested in women and go,

325
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,520
yeah, but maybe not like it's, it's a crazy thing to think, but that's why.

326
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
Well, but I mean, you're right, Travis.

327
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
Like I, I recently had to update my Facebook page

328
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,040
to remove some likes that I put on there in like 2004.

329
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,480
I had to, I had to manually delete some Rotten Tomatoes Facebook reviews

330
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,120
I had written about hit films like Garden State,

331
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,880
or I had to talk about how meaningful it was to me.

332
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,240
I had to, I had to manually delete my review of the time machine,

333
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,160
the hit film, the time machine, the remake.

334
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,960
So yes, Travis, I feel, I feel you, I do feel you,

335
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
but I think that most people have made the switch.

336
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
Most people made the jump.

337
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,920
I'm sure that most people's info is probably pretty accurate.

338
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
Now let's say this though.

339
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Maybe, maybe you should adjust your expectations.

340
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
You should definitely adjust your expectation.

341
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
That doesn't mean you can't, you know, hang out with this person.

342
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,240
Yeah.

343
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,040
Obviously hang out with them.

344
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,840
See what happens.

345
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
Not, no, don't see what happens.

346
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Don't, don't see what happens.

347
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Just hang out with them.

348
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
Cause you like them.

349
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,080
Just hang out with them and use your like,

350
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,400
like just use your heart and try to keep your head on a swivel

351
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
and see if you could assess your situation.

352
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
I feel like, cause my impulse was to tell this person

353
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,840
that they should, that they should ask,

354
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,040
like just bring it up and have a conversation about it.

355
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,280
But like literally that's a real, that's a real do as I say,

356
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,320
not as I do moment.

357
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
Cause I would not have that conversation

358
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
if I was not equipped with a jet pack.

359
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,320
If you didn't have one of those things that they use

360
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
for special effects on action movies that rip you back.

361
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
I need a guy to say at any moment to like,

362
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
oh, he's out, he's out, he's out.

363
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,560
Pull him out.

364
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
You need some kind of like a communicator device to say,

365
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,080
I need an extraction and then you're gone.

366
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah.

367
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,360
I need, I basically need the team from Armageddon

368
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,640
to like lower me in.

369
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,280
Yeah, but I don't know.

370
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,200
Just, I mean, I would give this,

371
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,520
regardless of the sexual orientation or gender

372
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,400
of anybody in this situation,

373
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
I would say don't, just don't go into it thinking like

374
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
tonight, tonight's the night.

375
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm finally gonna, it's finally gonna happen for me.

376
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,280
Sexually speaking, just go into it saying

377
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm gonna have a good time with this person.

378
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm gonna meet somebody.

379
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm gonna get to know people.

380
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Maybe we'll maybe end up being best friends.

381
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
Maybe we'll end up being best friends.

382
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,520
Maybe that Facebook status is false

383
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,160
and maybe it'll be more than that.

384
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,360
But I don't know.

385
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,560
I would be uncomfortable canceling any plans based on that

386
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,080
because then you're being a real heathen.

387
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
You just gotta ginny up

388
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,920
and you gotta just have a frank conversation with this person.

389
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,960
I agree.

390
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,080
It doesn't have to be frank, like walk in the room,

391
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,920
go, so what's the deal?

392
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Yeah.

393
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,480
You can just, it can come up in conversation

394
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,600
as you're talking about, you know,

395
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,120
that getting to know you stuff, you know,

396
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,400
like, you know, so you seeing anybody,

397
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,240
you know, that kind of stuff, you know,

398
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,280
let it just kind of come up.

399
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,200
I don't think so you seeing anybody

400
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
is a great question to ask on a date.

401
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
Not in the first 10.

402
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,040
Well, okay, oh, you're right.

403
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Cause if it's a date, if she thinks it's a date,

404
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,000
if she thinks it's a, do you see what I'm saying right now?

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Like, I think the only way that this person,

406
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
like I think actually the only approach to this

407
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,000
is to pretend you never saw it

408
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
and just try to live your life.

409
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,000
This is, but okay, but we can use this.

410
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
This can be actionable advice for everybody else.

411
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,800
If you are dating, if you're going on a date

412
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,400
with somebody, you're interested in somebody,

413
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
don't fucking Facebook them.

414
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,240
Yeah.

415
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Don't fucking Facebook them.

416
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,040
Cause it's A, it's cheating.

417
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
Your grandpa didn't have to do that.

418
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
And that's, he fell in love.

419
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,520
He fell in love in wartime.

420
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,040
Well, I also think that you, I mean,

421
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,560
it's sort of like, you lose a lot of the mystery,

422
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,240
I think, or like a lot of the interesting,

423
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,400
like there's a lot, I think you lose a lot of the mystique

424
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
of someone if you can crawl back

425
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,920
through their last six years of existence

426
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,440
and see every, you know, every thing they've done

427
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
and every party they've been to

428
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
and every person they know.

429
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,240
And it also cheapens those moments

430
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,160
where you find out you like the same movie

431
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,280
or listen to the same band.

432
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
If you already know it going in

433
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,960
and then she mentions it, you're like, yeah, yeah.

434
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
Like it seems to take a little bit

435
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,800
of the bam out of the firework.

436
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,000
A little bit of the bam out of the firework.

437
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,280
Which is not a saying.

438
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,040
It's, no, it is now because you've-

439
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,360
It is now, you just meant to listen.

440
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
Bam out of the firework.

441
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,440
Ginny up.

442
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
This is our most trademarkable episode yet.

443
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,400
We got a whole toy line coming out based on this one.

444
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,040
Not Ginny up though.

445
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,240
Hard to toy that one.

446
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,200
Hard to toy it.

447
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

448
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,360
Please.

449
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Please.

450
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm curious to see if this Yahoo will take off.

451
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,560
It was sent in by William Braun.

452
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,120
Thanks, William.

453
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,760
It's by Yahoo.

454
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
That's his user.

455
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,360
Ghost Dad starring Phil Cosby who asked-

456
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,120
It's a very good name.

457
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,960
Do people in the Pokemon universe eat Pokemon?

458
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Pokemon seem to be the only animals around the world

459
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,240
created by the show and games.

460
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Do the humans who live there eat Pokemon?

461
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,920
Considering that they can all be caught and trained,

462
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,840
they obviously have some sort of intelligence.

463
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,800
Would eating them be in violation of some sort of ethical code?

464
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,240
The only way around this, I suppose,

465
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,920
would be if everyone was vegetarian,

466
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,240
but I don't see much evidence to support either side.

467
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,200
What do you think?

468
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,680
Definitely.

469
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
Tricky quandary.

470
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,400
Tricky conundrum.

471
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,440
It's hard to catch them all if you keep fucking

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
getting high on your own supply, so to speak.

473
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,240
I feel like-

474
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay, so practically speaking,

475
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
in the world of Pokemon,

476
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
the battling and competition of Pokemon

477
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
is a huge business.

478
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
I mean, it's like the most important thing

479
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,320
in their world, right?

480
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
Yeah, I mean, it's on TV.

481
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,840
It's on TV, Team Rocket, World Celebrities.

482
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
The highest status you can hope to achieve

483
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
is to be the master, you know what I mean?

484
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,120
Like, the victor.

485
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,200
I ask this because it seems like

486
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,320
they would be too expensive to eat.

487
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
Like, anytime you eat one, it's like eating a show pony.

488
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
I guess, but the supply and demand is off there

489
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
because you can just fucking walk in the grass

490
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,400
and then there you go.

491
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,120
Yeah, nobody's eating, like, Mew,

492
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
but people are probably eating Pidgey left in there.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,600
You're saying there's a hierarchy of edible Pokemon,

494
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
and you're saying near the bottom of that

495
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
is a Pidgey, is a Magikarp, and then-

496
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,800
Oh, what's the mouse one?

497
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,560
Rattata.

498
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,200
Rattata?

499
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,920
But he's probably in there.

500
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,080
Oh, I could go for a Rattata Frattata right now.

501
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,880
It would be so good.

502
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,520
Yum yum.

503
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,920
Definitely.

504
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,400
But you're saying-

505
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Everybody's probably eating Slowpoke.

506
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
They're probably eating Snorlax

507
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
because they're, like, herd animals.

508
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,960
Sure. Snorlax is not.

509
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,560
Snorlax is actually fairly rare,

510
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,880
but I understand what you're saying.

511
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
God, I ate my Snorlax.

512
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,480
What if you just wander up to the campfire

513
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,360
and you see someone guiltily eating a Snorlax

514
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,480
and then you tell them, like, no, he was, like, really valuable.

515
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
There's always, like, two of those in this whole game.

516
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
I mean, but at the same time, though,

517
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
you got to keep in mind

518
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,840
there's only one Mewtwo you can catch, right?

519
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,400
I bet he is fucking delectable

520
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
because of the rarity of it.

521
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,400
That's the thing.

522
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,960
Only the super rich can afford to eat Mewtwo.

523
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
Now that's a tricky one

524
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,720
because he can speak English

525
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,680
according to the first movie.

526
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,960
Okay, that gets weird.

527
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,360
Oh, no.

528
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,560
He speaks the King's English,

529
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,720
so, like, that would be uncomfortable

530
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,480
unless you only ate just a little bit.

531
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Or you could do, like, one leg at a time.

532
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Yeah, precisely.

533
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,920
And then you could still have the Pokémon.

534
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
That would be an interesting twist

535
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,560
because, like, I've reviewed pretty much every game

536
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,720
that has ever come out for that series,

537
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
and, you know, it's a little stale.

538
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,160
It needs something to shake up the franchise.

539
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,000
What if you get your starter Pokémon

540
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,640
and you just eat it instantly right in front of them?

541
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,160
Right in front of the professor.

542
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,280
Which one do I want?

543
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
Which one do I want?

544
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
I'll take the grass type.

545
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,360
Let me get a little ranch.

546
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,720
Can I have another one?

547
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,120
Nope.

548
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,760
Ah, shit.

549
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,320
Game over.

550
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,640
End of the game.

551
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,240
If your list of Pokémon gets full

552
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,520
and you want to catch another one,

553
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,720
you have to eat it.

554
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,840
There's no storing it.

555
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,280
You store it in your belly

556
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,960
and you convert it to calorie energy.

557
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
And it's not just, like, a pop-up,

558
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
like, you've eaten it.

559
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
Like, you have to actively do it.

560
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,920
You have to press the button.

561
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,680
And if you press the buttons wrong,

562
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,080
it goes from, like, a smooth, easy mercy killing

563
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,960
to, like, a botched, really horrible experiment.

564
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,600
Exactly.

565
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,080
I think there needs to be some recognition

566
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
of the food chain of survival in the fittest.

567
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Because let's be honest,

568
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,080
if you're out in the environment,

569
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,280
you've got all your Pokémon are knocked out,

570
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,080
except for one,

571
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
and you fight like a fucking alligator,

572
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
and he kills your last Pokémon,

573
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,680
you're not just going to fall asleep

574
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,680
and wake up in a Pokémon center.

575
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,320
You'll be killed.

576
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,920
You'll be devoured.

577
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,080
Oh, let me throw out this twist.

578
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,000
I hope you're listening, Pokémon game developers.

579
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,500
They are.

580
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
If you want to evolve your Pokémon,

581
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
you have to make them eat another Pokémon of the same type.

582
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
Oh, that's good.

583
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
That's so good.

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
You, uh, if you, if your Pokémon loses,

585
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,920
you are force-fed the Pokémon.

586
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,440
Like, you have to.

587
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
By your opponent.

588
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,520
By your opponent, the opponent gets a fork

589
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,440
and just starts jamming it in.

590
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
Starts jamming bites of that beaten Pokémon into your mouth.

591
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,160
There is some guy right now at home jerking off.

592
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,640
I never thought that anyone would tickle my pleasure center

593
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,600
with Pokémon eating, uh, descriptions of it, like, finally.

594
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,800
He's very confused as to why he's doing it.

595
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,360
Like, I didn't know this was my thing until now.

596
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,860
Oh, no.

597
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,080
Oh, man.

598
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,000
Man, so many good ideas.

599
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,320
So many, so many ideas to capitalize on.

600
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
Just break your walls.

601
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,040
Like, try something new.

602
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,200
What about a game where there is no evolution

603
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,680
and it's all, um, intelligent design?

604
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,800
You know what I mean?

605
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,920
If you want your Charmander to evolve into Charmeleon,

606
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,680
you don't have to just get him to level 16

607
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,120
and then hope for the best.

608
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,320
You can say a little prayer.

609
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,800
Say, I wish, I wish my guy was a little bigger.

610
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,720
And then based on, like, your devotion rating,

611
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,520
maybe he'll come through for you.

612
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,080
Maybe you won't.

613
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,280
You have to sacrifice another Pokémon on an altar

614
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,040
to make it to prove your devotion to benevolent Pokémon God?

615
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't think we have to go quite so Old Testament.

616
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,760
I think that would be hard to hard to get past the ESRB, but...

617
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,320
No, your Pokémon just has to believe in Jesus.

618
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,820
Exactly.

619
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,680
You have to, you have to immerse him,

620
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,920
immerse them in the cleansing waters,

621
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,760
which may be difficult if it's a fire type.

622
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,040
The Jesus of this world, I feel like, would come down and just say,

623
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,600
stop eating Pokémon.

624
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
That was not the plan.

625
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,720
You messed it up.

626
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,560
They are actually supposed to be the dominant species, you guys.

627
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,600
They're too fucked up.

628
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
That's why some of them are dragons made of fire.

629
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
They're just a wiping people out.

630
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,880
I gave them all superpowers.

631
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,160
Like, you've got nothing.

632
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,080
Why are you eating them?

633
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
That's the Pokémon game I want,

634
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,080
when finally that fucking race war is ignited.

635
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,680
It's just Pokémon versus people.

636
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,520
The shortest race war in the history of mankind.

637
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,680
I'll tell you what I've seen a lot of in the Pokémon games,

638
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,360
and that is monsters capable of murdering each other

639
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,600
with incredible psychic abilities.

640
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,480
Something I've never seen in a Pokémon game is a gun.

641
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,720
So I think it would last.

642
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,880
I think we could handle some of the smaller ones,

643
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,800
but boy howdy would we be in the tall grass,

644
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
which is where you don't want to be,

645
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,080
specifically in the Pokémon universe.

646
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,960
Let's go to the money tub.

647
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
I got a message from my brother Chumby and his fiance Laurel.

648
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,880
You have another...

649
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
We have another brother?

650
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,360
No, this is a...

651
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,920
I'm a character.

652
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm playing a character.

653
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,520
Oh, okay.

654
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
Okay, could you do a character voice?

655
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,480
Okay.

656
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,080
Hi, it's me Robin.

657
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,560
Ellen.

658
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,080
This message is from my brother Chumby and his fiance Laurel.

659
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
Happy birthday and future vassary.

660
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm glad you could have May birthdays

661
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
and are planning your upcoming wedding

662
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,560
for the same month in 2014.

663
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
It makes it really easy to claim one present

664
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,560
for all three events.

665
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
I could have given you a hundred dollars,

666
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,880
but I spent it on this message instead.

667
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Suckers, love y'all.

668
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,000
You are now going to talk like that

669
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
for the remainder of the episode.

670
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,520
It hurts my ears.

671
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,480
It hurts our ears.

672
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,080
Yep.

673
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,880
I also like how it drifted in and out of an accent.

674
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,400
It was not...

675
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,760
That's her.

676
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,880
She's traveled a lot.

677
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
Robin is very continental.

678
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,080
Here's another message from Johan Sterner and Kajsa Lunde.

679
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,520
Oh man.

680
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Or Johan Sterner or...

681
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,720
Johan, I think we gotta go with Johan.

682
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,280
Johan Sterner and Kajsa Lunde or...

683
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,240
Man, fuck it.

684
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
It's for Frederick Olson.

685
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,360
These are not Americans.

686
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,960
These are non-American names.

687
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,040
You don't know that?

688
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,760
Melting pot.

689
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,720
You don't know that?

690
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
I hate to heat and out on you guys,

691
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,800
but these are not good red-blooded Americans.

692
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Maybe they are.

693
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,840
Okay.

694
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,080
Happy birthday to our best friend, Frederick Olson.

695
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,520
We know you like attention on your birthday,

696
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,800
so we figured there's no better way

697
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,440
than to get the brothers to say your name one more time.

698
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,000
We hope to share at least 25 more years of weird discussions,

699
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
too much vodka, and laughing way too loud

700
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
in just the wrong places.

701
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,880
Love, K-Dog, and Johan.

702
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
P.S. W.H.

703
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,040
What do you guys think?

704
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
I think there's probably more sentence there.

705
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,840
Oh, okay.

706
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,680
P.S. What?

707
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
P.S. How do you say our names?

708
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,600
That's why we have character limits, people.

709
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,080
Yeah.

710
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,680
You gotta tighten up.

711
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,080
So, happy birthday to Frederick,

712
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,720
and happy birthday to Chumby,

713
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
and future anniversary to Laurel.

714
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
We hope you all have a very special day.

715
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,080
You know how I guarantee that I have a very special day.

716
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,280
Do you know how I guarantee that?

717
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
How do you do it?

718
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,560
I get it.

719
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,240
Super wet.

720
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,360
What is it in this content?

721
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,920
My chins.

722
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,000
I have big news for you guys on the Extreme Restraints front.

723
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
ExtremeRestraints.com is, of course, your adult super store,

724
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,440
where you can get everything under the sun

725
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,040
that you're gonna put in your bum.

726
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,840
And that's a new tagline I'm working on.

727
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,360
They sent me a box.

728
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,840
Oh, man.

729
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,040
A sampler box.

730
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,080
I saw the JPEG.

731
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Oh, man.

732
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,360
There was a big penis.

733
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,680
Just this big penis.

734
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
It was a big penis.

735
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,560
Big penis, just this big.

736
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
And I don't mean a big penis.

737
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,560
I mean, like, make you doubt yourself giant.

738
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
Like, maybe somewhere out there,

739
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,360
there's a person with this equipment.

740
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,800
But it is a giant penis.

741
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,480
There was also-

742
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,040
Fake, right?

743
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,640
It wasn't like some sort of kidnapping warning.

744
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,760
It wasn't a threat.

745
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,520
What's in the box?

746
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,320
We kidnapped a tan elephant.

747
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,000
You'd think that's what Brad Pitt was thinking,

748
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
instead of like, well, at least it's not a giant dick.

749
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,840
It's just gonna punch you in the head.

750
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,640
Why did they send you a giant hog?

751
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
That wasn't the only thing in there.

752
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
There was some lube.

753
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,880
Oh, good.

754
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,000
There was three rings for dicks, which I-

755
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
Oh, wait, there's three?

756
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,080
So there's one for each of us?

757
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,640
Like, yeah, I will not be divvying those up.

758
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,240
Oh, come on.

759
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,200
I want to be Hart.

760
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,920
There was a little, what seemed to be a personal massager,

761
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,800
and a ring with spikes on it

762
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
that I'm not even trying to get into that biz.

763
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
That's for self-defense.

764
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,000
And then there was what looked like,

765
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,960
basically like a plastic Q-tip with a D on the end of it

766
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,400
that I think is supposed to go where the pee pee comes out.

767
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,840
That's not happening either.

768
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,080
Are the rings for your wiener?

769
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,280
I can't say what they actually,

770
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,600
that word makes me uncomfortable to say.

771
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
For your cock!

772
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,920
Thank you.

773
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:02,800
Are they adjustable in case you need it really big or really small?

774
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,120
One of those two.

775
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,560
Either really big or really small,

776
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
like if I bought one, would I have to?

777
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,440
Is sizing-

778
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,240
Are they sized?

779
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
So they're fairly sturdy silicone,

780
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,560
and you're supposed to get your balls and penis inside them.

781
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh, okay.

782
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,200
I don't want to give myself away,

783
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
but I either need it very big or very small.

784
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
There were three different sizes,

785
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,440
so I think that they could support the normal range of genital girth,

786
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I would say, whatever that is.

787
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,680
Okay.

788
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,720
Not normal, typical.

789
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,160
Go visit extremerestraints.com, go view their wares.

790
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,080
If you use the coupon code SWORDFISH,

791
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,440
I think is where we left it, then you can save 20% on your order,

792
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
which is a shit ton of money.

793
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,680
I figured out, I found out,

794
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,680
James Medina from Extreme Restraints explained to me how it gets hacked.

795
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:01,920
How?

796
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,760
It's not from people using it or tweeting about it,

797
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,600
it's from people Google searching because they can't remember Extreme Restraints coupon code,

798
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
and that's how it comes up.

799
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,600
So people, write down SWORDFISH on a Post-it, stick it to your monitor.

800
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,440
Don't Google search it, you fools.

801
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
Well, you told them the new password, right, Joe?

802
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:24,960
What?

803
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,600
I thought you did.

804
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,560
Did someone tell them that the password is SWORDFISH?

805
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,000
No, because if you fucking tell them, if you fucking tell them, it'll get leaked.

806
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,800
No, I didn't tell you about Extreme Restraints so they could put it in their computer.

807
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,640
One of us should probably do that.

808
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,600
Travis, why don't you handle that?

809
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,360
You've been our main point of contact.

810
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,640
Okay, I will email them after this.

811
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,600
But don't email them.

812
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,720
Oh, God.

813
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,120
I'll wire them.

814
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,720
The internet spiders are all over.

815
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
They'll crawl anything.

816
00:41:47,760 --> 00:42:17,520
So go visit, go shop, go get it wet.

817
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
The popular website on the internet.

818
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,440
Dave Hill's podcasting incident.

819
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,120
It's pretty much just like me making out with your ears or something.

820
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,800
Okay, thanks.

821
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,120
Bye.

822
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
I often find myself flying alone on trips.

823
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,960
The problem comes when using the restroom at the airport.

824
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,560
As a solo, as a solo flyer, it's Mother's Day, shut up.

825
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,480
My only option is to take my carry-on bags with me into the bathroom.

826
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,120
But then what?

827
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,360
I hate putting my bags on the bathroom floor, but I don't see any other choice.

828
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,640
Help me out, brothers.

829
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,520
What can I do?

830
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,920
Well, I mean, real talk, aren't there usually like hooks on the back of bathroom stall doors?

831
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,480
This is a real issue because finding a trusted confidant is the best option.

832
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,360
But even then, how can you really trust anybody in this crazy world of ours?

833
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,400
The problem is in this day and age, even if you do that, like, hey, we've just been

834
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,200
having a nice conversation for the last 10 minutes.

835
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,400
Could you watch my bag?

836
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,440
Like instantly in an airport, everybody's butthole seizes up.

837
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,400
You're like, oh, God, just like in the homeland.

838
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm saying that because that's the kind of thing that security guards at airports are

839
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,560
on point for, people walking away from their bags.

840
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
Yeah, yeah, they're waiting for it.

841
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
But at the same time, when you wheel that shit in the bathroom, and then there's an

842
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,640
expensive business, an expensive businessman, there's an expensive businessman who sees

843
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,120
you do that.

844
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,280
And he's like, oh, you're bringing your luggage in the bathroom, huh?

845
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,760
You're going to make poop bags because that's what it is now.

846
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,480
That's that luggage that you got for graduation that was new.

847
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,360
Now it's poop bags.

848
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,120
Those are your bags.

849
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,800
Never fly by yourself.

850
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,160
Nobody else can touch that handle now because there was at least a 10 second period where

851
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,120
you touch it with poop hands.

852
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,280
There was in the Charlotte airport, if you've spent as much time there as Griffin and I

853
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,040
have over the years, you will know that there are attendants in the bathrooms.

854
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:19,200
They are, by and large, the worst because it is creating this false social system where

855
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,320
I have had any problem with any part of this exchange over the past three decades.

856
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,880
I know my whole routine when I go in.

857
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,640
I do not need someone handing me a paper towel or more likely judging me for not washing

858
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,040
my hands.

859
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,760
But they babysit your bags for you, right?

860
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,840
That's what I'm thinking.

861
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Maybe that is the actual use of an attendant.

862
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,240
You say like, hey, can you keep an eye on this?

863
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,280
I'm taking the dude to poopytown.

864
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,440
Right.

865
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,240
And he says like, no problem.

866
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,720
I got this for you.

867
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,200
He would say no problemo because he's cool.

868
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
What?

869
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
He's cool.

870
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,480
Not because I wasn't saying that to be racist.

871
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,520
I'm saying it because he was like, no problemo, chief.

872
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,160
You know what I mean?

873
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,520
And then you have to give him some money when you get out.

874
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,280
That's the exchange you're making here.

875
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,320
What about lockers?

876
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
What about bathroom lockers?

877
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,360
You can put your effects in there.

878
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,720
Oh, those keys though.

879
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,360
Never mind.

880
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:26,000
It's sort of like the shoe cradles at McDonald's play place.

881
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,560
That's exact.

882
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,240
I'm talking about a cubbyhole.

883
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,480
I would want there to be some security though.

884
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,880
But there's no way to sterilize that security, if that makes sense.

885
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,480
A keypad even with a new pin that you have to recognize.

886
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,240
Oh, those numbers would be so grubby.

887
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,960
Oh, they would be grubby to the maximum degree.

888
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,320
OK.

889
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,120
Something just occurred to me as a matter of fact.

890
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,560
Something just occurred to me as I've been thinking about this problem.

891
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,040
What's that?

892
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,080
Unless I've missed something along the lines, when you enter an airport,

893
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,440
you go through very extensive security checks.

894
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,680
Yes.

895
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,120
So then why, once you're past that point, can't you leave your bag sitting around?

896
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,560
You should fucking-

897
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
What are they afraid has happened?

898
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,480
I actually have this thought too, Travis.

899
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:20,720
It's like, there is not a cross section of people who A, have paid $400 to be in a building,

900
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,360
and also are going to take a shot at stealing someone's suitcase.

901
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,800
Like that's not, that Venn diagram doesn't really line up.

902
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,760
I know what you're saying.

903
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,800
I've thought that often at an airport.

904
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,640
Like, well, I feel a little bit safer here because that's a pretty long grift.

905
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,640
If you're buying a plane ticket so you can get into a place and steal bags.

906
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,040
Well, I also think it's like the security thing, but it just seems to me like,

907
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,920
hey, once you pass that point, hey, you're, you're, it's like, uh,

908
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,840
it's like international waters.

909
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,320
You know what I mean?

910
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,040
You're cool.

911
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,320
Like everybody's okay here.

912
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,160
I don't know.

913
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,640
I don't know.

914
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,680
Maybe, maybe I'm just a little bit, I see the world as a little bit sunnier place where I trust people.

915
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah.

916
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,240
How about it?

917
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,040
How about it?

918
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,400
The world, huh?

919
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,360
Just think about it because I'd rather trust people than get poop on my bag.

920
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,600
Sure.

921
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,960
The end.

922
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,560
I guess the bigger question is why, when you go through security,

923
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,600
why do they have to touch so many kid balls?

924
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,400
Fucking weirdos.

925
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
I'm just saying you got bomb sized balls, kid.

926
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,520
Let's see them.

927
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,200
That's a compliment.

928
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:35,920
That's a compliment.

929
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,360
You have bomb sized balls.

930
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,480
Your balls are the bomb.

931
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,680
Teddy, I got a new one.

932
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
Your balls are the bomb.

933
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,520
Write it down.

934
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,200
I'm going to use that a lot.

935
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
I'm going to use that a lot over the next few months.

936
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,560
When I touch approximately 1,800 kid balls in 900 scrotums.

937
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,360
It's going to be great.

938
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,200
Remind me, remind me to say it.

939
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,840
If I forget.

940
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,440
God, they're the worst.

941
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,280
You guys want to Yahoo?

942
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,320
Yeah.

943
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,440
They're American heroes.

944
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,400
They are American heroes.

945
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,760
Thanks for the security, but also the insecurity in some places.

946
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,680
Can we stop, by the way, TSA, if you're listening, and I'm sure you are.

947
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,080
Can we stop with the shoes now?

948
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,040
I think we're reaching a point where we can.

949
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,440
Grandparents and kids don't have to.

950
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:19,760
Right.

951
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,400
Which is like a crazy thing to say.

952
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,400
There's no way you'd put them in your kid's shoes.

953
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,720
Who would ever think of that?

954
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,720
Oh, maybe a terrorist who knows you don't check those kids' shoes anymore.

955
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,880
Like, I think they could work out getting a kid.

956
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,480
Do you guys think that by answering this question, we are now on a watch list?

957
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,960
Definitely.

958
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,920
Okay.

959
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,800
Absolutely.

960
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,120
We're on a lot of watch lists for this episode.

961
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,840
We're on Patricia Heaton's watch list, so it's for god damn sure.

962
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,760
And that is a list you do not want to be on.

963
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,240
She will say some shit about you at the Golden Globes.

964
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,000
Hachi machi.

965
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,360
Hachi machi, indeed.

966
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,080
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Cal Skullthroop.

967
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,720
Thanks, Cal.

968
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Soccerman who asks, can my-

969
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,240
I think it's pronounced Soccerman.

970
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,080
Soccerman, JP Soccerman asks, can my parents sue me for breaking the window?

971
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,400
I was playing cracker with my younger brother and I hit it and it shattered the window.

972
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:16,960
I'm 15.

973
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
Wait, was playing what now?

974
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,840
Cracker.

975
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,200
What is cracker?

976
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,680
What's that?

977
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,480
Have you ever heard of skank and skanky biscuit?

978
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,400
Oh, I don't think it's the same thing.

979
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
I hope it's not the same thing.

980
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,880
In the UK-

981
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,280
Why skanky biscuit broke the window?

982
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,240
In the UK, it's called nasty cracker.

983
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh, no.

984
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,920
In the Mediterranean region, it's uh oh, pita.

985
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,600
And I like nodding non.

986
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,040
Oh, I was god damn it.

987
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
You beat me to it, I was gonna say no, no, no, damn it.

988
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,360
I don't know what cracker is, but the question is, can we bring lawyers into this?

989
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,840
Can you sue a kid?

990
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Do you remember the documentary North?

991
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,080
Yeah.

992
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,360
I feel like that's got a lot of legal precedent for this kind of thing.

993
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,760
Sure, yeah.

994
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,680
Scalia frequently, frequently brings that up as a super precedent.

995
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,800
I know that kids can't go to jail, which is crazy.

996
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,880
Just because they're younger, but they can still be little criminals.

997
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,320
They can still be little murderers.

998
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,120
Meanwhile, Jodi Arias, poor sweet little Jodi Arias, just because she's over 18.

999
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,080
That's not right.

1000
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,040
Not my America.

1001
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,600
What do you think should happen to Jodi Arias who killed her boyfriend?

1002
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,800
She's just as sweet and innocent and frumpy.

1003
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,880
She's frumpy now.

1004
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,920
She didn't used to be frumpy.

1005
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,880
She frumped herself up.

1006
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,840
Isn't that enough?

1007
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,200
Isn't that punishment enough?

1008
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,480
She's been fully frumped out.

1009
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,320
She's been frumped to the max.

1010
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,160
She has to wear glasses.

1011
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,720
She has to wear glasses and her hair is brown now.

1012
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,880
You have sucked the life out of her, CNN.

1013
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Why can't we sue some kids is the question.

1014
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,720
Because I have some kids.

1015
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh man, I have some kids I'd sue.

1016
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,640
Who would you sue?

1017
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,360
Who would be the first kid you'd sue?

1018
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,160
I saw Iron Man 3 last week and I had to sit next to a kid.

1019
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,840
That kid for sure, definitely.

1020
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,160
Okay.

1021
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,920
Let's just say the Alamo Drafthouse did not crack down on their no talking law on this

1022
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,960
use, which I guess they have an exemption for under 18s, which again is super fucked up.

1023
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,200
I paid my money and I want to see all the movies.

1024
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,400
I want to see all the movies.

1025
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,440
Can't you summon someone over?

1026
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,320
Can't you beckon and say this kid's a pit?

1027
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,800
I can.

1028
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,600
I can do that.

1029
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,320
If I want to fucking ruin this kid's life.

1030
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,720
This is all that he wants is to see Iron Man 3.

1031
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,000
There was a lot of bouncing.

1032
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,840
Is there a statute of limitations on this?

1033
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,960
Because there's a kid when I saw Harry Potter 7 Part 2 that was dressed as Harry Potter

1034
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,600
and loudly announced how it was different in the book every time something happened.

1035
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,840
But that was like, you know, two or three, four years ago.

1036
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,400
Oh yeah.

1037
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,240
Is it too late to sue that kid?

1038
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,280
You missed your window.

1039
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,440
I think the window for kids suing is like a month, two, maybe tops.

1040
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,440
I would actually really appreciate that service if I was in a movie theater watching Harry

1041
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
Potter 7 too.

1042
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,360
Are you Timmy?

1043
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,840
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

1044
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,240
Thanks kid.

1045
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,200
Are you Timmy Jenkins?

1046
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,040
We have some popcorn for you.

1047
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,080
Yeah, I'm Timmy Jenkins.

1048
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,480
Just kidding.

1049
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,280
You just got served.

1050
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,920
Nice try, Bucko.

1051
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,160
Are you Timmy Jenkins?

1052
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,760
No, I'm Jimmy Rankins.

1053
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,720
Ah, fuck.

1054
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,120
Got us.

1055
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,560
Next time.

1056
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,200
Finally a good reason for kids not to talk to strangers when we try to serve you.

1057
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,960
We got a present here for you.

1058
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,600
I'm not sure about it this time.

1059
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,480
I'm gonna need you to give it to my associate, please.

1060
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,000
Hey, good news.

1061
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,760
You're gonna go on the super toy run.

1062
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,000
Holy shit, I never thought it would happen to me.

1063
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,040
Just get in this van.

1064
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,240
You're in a court.

1065
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,480
Right.

1066
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
There's a court inside the van?

1067
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,440
Van court.

1068
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,920
A court inside the super toy run.

1069
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,560
You take one turn, turn left at the creepy crawlers and oops, you're in court.

1070
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,560
Kid court.

1071
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,480
This has been our advice show, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1072
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,000
We sure hope you've enjoyed listening to it nearly as much as we've enjoyed recording it.

1073
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's a genuine pleasure and an honor to do this show for you every week.

1074
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,040
And we love you so much and thank you for continuing to listen.

1075
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,800
And we have a new My Brother, My Brother and Me sampler.

1076
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:48,880
It's at bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM2013 so you can go check that out.

1077
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,640
And it's a great way to get people into the show so you can share it with them.

1078
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,360
It is a little heavy on dick stuff.

1079
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,440
I don't think it's more dick.

1080
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,360
I feel like it is representative to the...

1081
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,000
See, this was before I switched to more neutral terms like Jenny up.

1082
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,040
So I feel like now, yes, it is dick heavy for us.

1083
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,000
Now we are more equal opportunity genital discussers.

1084
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,320
Discussioners.

1085
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,760
Mentalisters.

1086
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,040
We got a live show coming up in Max Fun Con.

1087
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,760
So that'll be up later this month.

1088
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,680
Psyched about Max Fun Con.

1089
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,400
You guys pumped?

1090
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh, so pumped.

1091
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,560
You guys...

1092
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,240
Hey, which reminds me, if you're gonna be at Max Fun Con, if you're gonna be at our live show,

1093
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:39,600
start sending in your questions now and make sure to put in the subject line Max Fun Con question.

1094
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,360
So you can be sure to hit your question at the live show.

1095
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,280
We should clarify that this is not an open to the public live show.

1096
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,520
This is a live show we're doing at Max Fun Con.

1097
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,440
But you'll be able to hear the show, probably our first episode of June when that goes up.

1098
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,760
It'll be a Max Fun Con special.

1099
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,160
We are talking about doing more live shows though.

1100
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,960
We are making, we are having more earnest discussions than we've had all year, I would say.

1101
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,720
The gears, they are a turning.

1102
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,080
Speaking of live shows, our buddies at Throwing Shade are working on a tour right now.

1103
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,080
They have lots of dates kind of moving throughout the country.

1104
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,120

One more thing, Tristan the Marine is shipping out soon.

1111
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,160
And so to send them off right, there's a kind of East Coast,

1112
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,800

1113
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,400

Go check it out.

1117
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,920
I don't think people know how Eventbrite...

1118
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,120
I don't know.

1119
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,480
I've never heard of Eventbrite.

1120
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,080
Well, that's because you don't get invited to shit.

1121
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,920
God knows that's true.

1122
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,080
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1123
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,080
into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1124
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,200
It was as much as I appreciated the new theme song that we used on 150,

1125
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,280
which as many people we got saying that they loved it,

1126
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,360
we got as many people saying, please never, please don't use that again.

1127
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,440
I missed it.

1128
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,720
You're crazy, by the way.

1129
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,320
I missed the power start we get from it's a departure.

1130
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,680
So thanks, John Roderick.

1131
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,480
Thanks, the Long Winters.

1132
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,960

So help support the show and we'll make funny jokes about you and your loved ones.

1138
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,040
Please include a phonetic spelling of your fucking names, though.

1139
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,040
Jesus.

1140
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,680
Griffin, do you have one more question for us?

1141
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,640
A final yahoo.

1142
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,240
It was a fun question.

1143
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,360
Griffin, do you have one more question for us a final yahoo it was sent in by one to grow on, if you will.

1144
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,240
Oh, it was sent in by Frederick Olson, the birthday boy.

1145
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,400
Thanks, Frederick.

1146
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1147
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,680
Yo, yo, who asks.

1148
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,920
I want to join the Illuminati and become famous with basketball.

1149

Kiss your dad.

School wear on the lips.
