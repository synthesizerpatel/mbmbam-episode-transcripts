1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the Modron Era.

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm Griffin McElroy, and it's Are You Guys in the Spirit of Spirits?

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,320
What do you mean?

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,920
Are you guys in it? Are you guys feeling these Jack O'Lantern vibes, baby?

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
Don't look right at the full moon, or else you'll turn right into a werewolf.

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,520
Here they come.

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,800
I don't think that's how that works.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,080
The dead are coming, and they're gonna fucking kill us.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
Yeah, man, there's fucking skeletons and zombies,

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,360
and they're gonna climb out of their graves, and they're gonna beat us down, baby.

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Griffin, can I stop you real quick?

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
Yeah, please.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
I don't see what this has to do with War with Grandpa.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
We're doing a quick delay on talking about War with Grandpa anymore that we have already.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,080
Okay, we'll get back to it though, right?

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,480
We'll file that one in with the Star Wars live show

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,800
in a folder that is called The McElroy Brothers Continue to Forget

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,560
to Not Talk About One Film or Film Franchise for a Whole Episode,

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
because some people don't like that.

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,520
Can I say one thing about War with Grandpa?

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
Yeah, please.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
I want to get back in the spirit of spirits for how long I can go on.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
I just want to say one thing.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,960
We got a friend forwarded us a review, they called it an interview,

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,240
where they offer an interview, basically, with one of the producers of the film.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,560
But I did want to share this one line from this thing.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
It said, it'll be one of the first family films to go into theaters this fall,

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
following the pandemic.

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,200
Imagine my relief that this fall will be following the pandemic,

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
instead of right the fuck in the middle of it.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Yeah, okay.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
So anyway, there's a skeleton that has two knives.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,880
And there's actually, did I say one skeleton?

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Because there's many skeletons.

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm trying to get everybody scared.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
Is this, okay, I roll perception to see if there's any sort of-

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,120
No, we're not doing that.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,760
We're not doing that.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
We're not doing that.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
But they are coming and they do have knives.

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,320
And I want everyone to get scared because I feel like it's late September

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
and I'm not even feeling the-

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
You're not feeling scared?

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,280
You're not?

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,600
Whoa.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Oh, well, okay, I feel very, very scared about everything but Halloween.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,320
Okay.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,440
And I have been, I've been getting in the mood.

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
Yeah, Howard, tell me.

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
Or as one might say, the boo-d.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah, one might say that.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
One could say anything.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, I have been drinking that hot apple cider.

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,760
That's not very sweet.

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,320
Enjoying a pumpkin spice latte under a warm afghan blanket.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
Yeah.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,480
And I have just been sitting by the fire and reading Chaucer.

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,400
Chaucer, huh?

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
Chaucer's the scariest.

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Yeah, I was reading some Chaucer, his classic tales about Canterbury.

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,800
And by Chaucer, do you mean chooser?

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,720
Like a werewolf chewing on your bones?

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,520
No, I mean like the guy from Knight's Tale.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
I love him.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
I've been going to the park and yelling,

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
somebody chase me!

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
And waiting to get chased in the nighttime.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, I've been chased by a werewolf before, Griffin.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,960
It's not funny.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,640
It's not fun or funny.

76
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,960
Well, no, but yours was a real werewolf attack.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Mine is for Halloween fun.

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
Justin, how have you been getting scared and really scared?

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
I just put up our inflatables.

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, fuck yeah.

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
Give us the rundown, baby.

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
What are we working with in the McElroy front yard this year?

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, I don't want to tell you.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I don't want to get doxxed, but I did buy-

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
That's fair.

86
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,560
That's fair.

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,280
I did buy a, you know, the little kid Sam from Trick or Treat?

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,520
Yeah.

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
You know, the little pumpkin-headed boy?

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,040
Yeah.

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, sure.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Got a mask of him.

93
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,920
Fuck.

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,400
Yeah, so that has been a lot of fun with the kids,

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,720
just kind of keeping them on their fucking toes.

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah.

97
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,480
You want to keep your kids off the iPad, make them have one eye

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
always on the lookout for Sam to come up and snatch them.

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Now, what I've done to get really in the mood is I've been setting up

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,960
kind of scary, like, cardboard cutouts around the house.

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Mostly they're all Robert De Niro from Our With Grandpa.

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,560
There's a couple of speglies.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,800
Stop.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,480
You can't say that anymore.

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,840
You can't talk about it anymore.

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
That cannot be a shorthand for comedy.

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,040
That's fair.

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,760
I made chocolate pumpkins with peanut butter in them.

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
Not scary.

110
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Not funny.

111
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
Well, why's it got to be scary?

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,840
You know, I enjoy, I don't like the scary movies.

113
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
The scariest movies I like to watch at Halloween,

114
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
maybe Hocus Pocus if I'm feeling brave.

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
Hocus Pocus is fucked up.

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,200
Hocus Pocus is fucked up.

117
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
That cat suffers a fate worse than death.

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
So does the zombie man.

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,480
First five minutes, little girl dies.

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,520
First five minutes.

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
This is the price of admission.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
It is a Disney movie, isn't it?

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,760
It is.

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
Family member gotta die.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Gotta die.

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,320
I've been struggling even with my costume.

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,000
And usually I have that ironed out by fucking April.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
But this year it's like what sort of topical,

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
like, you know, pun or play on words

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,800
or funny or reverent thing, like, can you even do for 2020?

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
I do want to make an announcement along these lines.

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,200
We had a press release come out two days ago from Yandy.

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,840
If you don't know Yandy, they have in the past couple years

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
gotten in a little hot water,

135
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,840
but with no, they do a sexy fake news costume.

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,080
Okay.

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,640
And a sexy Handmaid's Tale costume, which was less,

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
that one was tough.

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Misses the mark a bit.

140
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, a swing and a miss.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,880
Yes, that one was controversial, but they have announced

142
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,280
that they will not, not be making a sexy COVID.

143
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Wow, Yandy.

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,640
So this, this one's off the table, huh?

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,760
This one, no sexy COVID.

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Just straight down the middle COVID.

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,920
No, no COVID in this one.

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,520
Let me just, I'm just going to say COVID de Kovny.

149
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
A representative for the company for Yandy said,

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
quote, I don't think there's anything sexy about it.

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah, no, there's probably not.

152
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm still going to go trick or treating.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,440
That's all I know.

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
I love them tiny Milky Ways.

156
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,520
You know what I mean?

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,000
Like-

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
No, you're actually not going to do that.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
What?

160
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,600
But I, but I love those tiny Milky Ways, Justin.

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
He has to get them.

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
Where am I supposed to get my tiny Milky Ways from?

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
If he doesn't get them, Justin, he turns into a big cartoon wolf.

164
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
You remember, you've seen that.

165
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
I chased you that one time.

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
You've seen him mask out, like the mask.

167
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Yeah.

168
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,080
And he freaks the fuck out if he doesn't get his little Milky Ways.

169
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
Because I didn't have my tiny Milky Ways.

170
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, they call them-

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't try to get me big Milky Ways chopped up.

172
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
I can see right through that shit.

173
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,640
They call them fun size, but for Travis,

174
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,600
they should call them like necessary, like medicine size.

175
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,100
Yeah.

176
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I don't think there's anything sexy about COVID.

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,080
I agree.

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
I received an email invitation for an event yesterday called Dinner at Dan's.

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,960
The email was likely not meant for me.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
As I know, there is someone else in my state who has the exact same email as me,

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
but with the at Yahoo instead of at Gmail.

182
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,080
You are the superior Dan, I will say.

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,280
The invitation contained a Zoom link to the event next week.

184
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,520
The only other guest on the invitation is Dan.

185
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,120
And when I assumed to be his spouse, I know the invite wasn't meant for me,

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
but it's hard to make new friends these days.

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,380
Yep.

188
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,880
No.

189
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,360
And I don't want to pass up an opportunity for human contact.

190
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
How do I show up at this dinner without making it weird

191
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
or immediately getting kicked out of the Zoom call?

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,100
Can't.

193
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,120
Well, hold on.

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,400
Should I bring a virtual gift?

195
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,240
That's from Lonely in Chicago.

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,360
The event, P.S., is from 3 to 8 p.m., so it's a five-hour dinner.

197
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,860
Good hang.

198
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,360
Woof.

199
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Cool hang.

200
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,860
Cool hang.

201
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,320
Wouldn't do that even if it was sent to me.

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,840
Munchy, munchy, five hours on the phone watching the other person chew

203
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
for at least half an minute.

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Do you think Dan would immediately kick them off the Zoom call?

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
There'd have to be some time.

206
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
It wouldn't just be like, boop, boop, boop.

207
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,380
Ah, nope.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,480
Right?

209
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
There would be some-

210
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
Stranger got hacked.

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Hello?

212
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
And you'd be like, hey, don't hang up.

213
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm your new friend.

214
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
You couldn't even warm your way in.

215
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
You say a gift, but you can't be like, oh, don't kick me out.

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
I've got bruschetta just for me.

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Oh, I've got it.

218
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,560
You get to watch me eat all this sloppy bruschetta.

219
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
Here's what you do.

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,040
Okay.

221
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,200
Oh, my camera is not working, but it is me, your friend.

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,840
Ask me anything that only Dan would know.

223
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,040
Oh, fuck.

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
Why did I say that?

225
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,520
No, I don't know.

226
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,160
Oh, fuck.

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't know anything that Dan knows.

228
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,920
Now ask me something Dan wouldn't know, and I probably know it.

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Let me prove to you I'm not Dan.

230
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
Partner, you can't do this.

231
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
You can't, partner.

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,880
Partner, you need to saddle on up from Mozi out of town.

233
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,520
Partner, you can't.

234
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
I hate texts.

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,440
You can't do this, partner.

236
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,400
You can't do this one.

237
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,160
There's no way to do this one good.

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,960
I do a weekly Zoom hangout with my friends here in town.

239
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,800
Been doing it since March.

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
It's a very great event for me.

241
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
It lights up my life.

242
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,440
And also last week during the call, I was like,

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
man, this is too much human contact for me.

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,400
The idea of entertaining a stranger as an online conference

245
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,640
call hitchhiker is just completely non-viable for any living human being.

246
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Could you ask, I have one way it could work.

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
This is one way it could possibly work.

248
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,280
Okay.

249
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,800
You forwarded it, you forwarded it to proper Dan.

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Yahoo, Dan.

251
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
I think the party's at Dan's.

252
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,840
Are they both Dan?

253
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
What is happening here?

254
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,760
I don't understand what is happening in this question anymore.

255
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,520
No, no, Dan is the host of the dinner.

256
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,720
It's dinner at Dan's.

257
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,240
So Dan sent the invite to question asker.

258
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,760
So the only other people on the invite are Dan.

259
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
Are Dan and Dan's spouse.

260
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Okay, the other person, you send it to the other, the correct you.

261
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,440
You're not Dan.

262
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
The lonely in Chicago at yahoo.com.

263
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,840
You send it to them and you're like, hey, I got this.

264
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,600
I think it was, might've been meant for you.

265
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
I've got some of your mail before.

266
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,160
And this is gonna sound a little weird, but would you be willing to ask

267
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
if I could also come along?

268
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,120
There you go.

269
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,160
Do you get a plus one?

270
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Do you get a plus, do you get a plus me?

271
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Cause that, cause we have the same name.

272
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,560
So we're kind of the same person.

273
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
I was technically, if you want to get like super, and I hate to be this guy,

274
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
but if you want to get super technical, I was invited to it instead of you.

275
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
So, and I'll be your wing man.

276
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
If you're trying to hook up with Dan, I'm just telling you.

277
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,960
Hey, is this a great idea?

278
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Let me know if this is a great and profitable idea.

279
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,320
Cause I mentioned using, watch me eat bruschetta as a gift,

280
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,360
but would it be cool if there were like entertainers you could hire

281
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,200
for your Zoom hang to just like do some magic

282
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
or play like a mariachi band or something like that

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,920
while you and your friends played like Jackbox games or whatever the fuck.

284
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,520
Griffin, you're a very innovative thinker, but there's no way that doesn't exist.

285
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,440
We're six months into quarantine.

286
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
You don't think someone's thought of, I will play music or do magic

287
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
during your Zoom call?

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,280
Not as a surprise.

289
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,760
I mean, we've had a, we on this call have had a party with a princess.

290
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
That's factual.

291
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, we have mostly for our children.

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,480
Let's be clear.

293
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,840
Family fun princesses hooked us up with a delightful princess encounter.

294
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,320
Yeah.

295
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,040
And by most of you-

296
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,720
You know, BB's skill is like, hey, can we call Rapunzel back?

297
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
And I'm like, oh, I think Rapunzel's pretty busy, buddy.

298
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
She had such a good time with us,

299
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,680
but I do like the idea though, if it's not an entertainer,

300
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,240
but rather like just a bon vivant.

301
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Somebody who like-

302
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, cool.

303
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,880
Just somebody who's there to keep conversation sparkling.

304
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,520
You know what I mean?

305
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,760
Just so if there's a lull in it that you just have them sort of

306
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
spice it up a little bit.

307
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,360
That's French Michael, Michel.

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,280
Ah, you know, your trip to Target reminds me of my trip to Monaco.

309
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

310
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,200
He's not going to make it all about him.

311
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,520
Oh.

312
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Michel is going to make it all about the party guests.

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
He's making it special for them.

314
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Yeah.

315
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,200
He's being fascinated by their tales.

316
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
Everyone come listen.

317
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,600
Pieter is telling me the most fascinating story.

318
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,880
Now tell me, what did they do on Family Guy last evening?

319
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
Gather, gather round.

320
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
We're all on the same computer, Michel.

321
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
I don't know how.

322
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,000
Susan has the most wonderful Borat impression.

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
You all must hear this.

324
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
I've secretly asked-

325
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Go ahead, Susan.

326
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,720
Do it.

327
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
My wife.

328
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I've secretly asked all of you to tell me your heart's darkest desires.

329
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,200
I held them on flash cards in front of me.

330
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm going to hold up each desire and I will ask you to guess which of our party guests

331
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,720
gathered here tonight is the one with the most perverse, perverse urging.

332
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Also-

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Michel, I'd like you to go ahead and line up.

334
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,640
Tonight, one of you will be murdered.

335
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,920
What?

336
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,840
It's not my thing.

337
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,040
It's not part of this.

338
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm just letting-

339
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,560
Warning.

340
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
One of you is, just statistically speaking, one of you is going to be murdered tonight.

341
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
That's the fucking thing, right?

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
This is the thing.

343
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Oh my God, this is a billion dollar business.

344
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Zoom call with all your friends and a new friend of yours who they don't know.

345
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
You guys have got to meet my friend, Michel.

346
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,400
And Michel gets murdered 10 minutes in and then the murderer is sneaking around in the

347
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,080
back and leaving clues and everything.

348
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,400
And you got to solve the murder.

349
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,520
Oh, that would be cool if you saw someone get murdered in your Zoom and then you watched

350
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,600
the criminal just poke around and bumble around and maybe check out their Madden

351
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Ultimate team on their Xbox in the back.

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Hey, hey, put that down.

353
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,160
That would be the fucking coolest juice of me and my eight friends, the only eight friends

354
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
I have, watched someone get murdered and then yelled at the screen over and like,

355
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,040
stop, don't murder him, no, get out of there, hey, get out of there.

356
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
He was in the middle of a Madden game.

357
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
But then the murderer would have the flashcards.

358
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,640
Wait, now we're back to the perverse design of things?

359
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
No, no, no, no, it's all connected.

360
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,480
The murderer now has the flashcards that you gave Michel.

361
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,400
So now you have to kill the murderer.

362
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,680
Now, someone has to have the fucking guts to kill this guy.

363
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
He knows too much.

364
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,040
You're risking COVID and you're gonna have to murder a human being to protect everyone's

365
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,840
dark secrets.

366
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,800
So if Michel lives close to me, keep him talking, I'm not gonna go kill that guy.

367
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,640
Nah, fuck that, watch this, bing-bong.

368
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,040
I gave him a thumbs down emoji reaction.

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
That's what I think, got it.

370
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,320
I always feel like I have, I always say that I don't have any great ideas for stories.

371
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
And I think it's because I waste them turning them into jokes.

372
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
If I had said everything I said with a different tone of voice, I could have a hit film on

373
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,600
my hands, I don't know.

374
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,840
And also, by the way, this is, I understand, similar to the Shudder original host.

375
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,680
But that, there's no flashcards and nobody named Michel.

376
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,760
True, and we're not in it.

377
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,320
And we're not in it and we're not profiting from its success.

378
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,640
We would be in this as the three murderers.

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,140
Okay.

380
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, Michel is very powerful and knows many martial arts, so he's able to defend himself.

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
And I'm willing to be the one that Michel takes out before we can take him out.

382
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,360
That would be cool to just watch two guys fight in your Zoom call.

383
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
And one of them die.

384
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,440
No.

385
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Okay, so here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people, thank you.

386
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Robert.

387
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,560
And Robert has this question.

388
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,680
What would you do if someone offered you blueberries from their wicker basket, but when you looked

389
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,640
inside, they were stones instead?

390
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,280
Would you be mad?

391
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,740
Huh.

392
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,160
Well?

393
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,840
Seems abstract, an abstract idea, but really close your eyes and...

394
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
Okay, I'm imagining it.

395
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay.

396
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
Walk me through.

397
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
Well, you're walking down a rural road.

398
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
Why's it gotta be rural?

399
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,880
Why's it gotta be rural? Because I don't think people are selling basket fulls of blueberries.

400
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
Farmer's market, asshole.

401
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,560
I doubt, like a mobile farmer's market where somebody's just like, hey, you got blueberries

402
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:30,880
here.

403
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,240
Well, they shut off the ends of the street, there was a farmer's market, they bought the

404
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,080
blueberries, now they're walking home from the farmer's market, and then they're gonna

405
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,560
give them to me.

406
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Okay, in my fucking scene, it's a rural countryside.

407
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,800
That makes more sense.

408
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,080
And you're walking down and let's say, let me face cast this person.

409
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,360
Teri Hatcher is walking down the road with a wicker basket full of blueberries.

410
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,920
It's not really Teri, like if you saw Teri Hatcher, you'd be like, oh fuck, is that Teri

411
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Hatcher?

412
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,920
But this is not Lois Lane, this is-

413
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,600
So it's not Teri Hatcher, just looks like Teri Hatcher.

414
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,880
And she has a shawl that is covering her, and she comes up and says-

415
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
Then how do I know it's Teri Hatcher?

416
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
It's not, you don't know it's-

417
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,920
This is a blueberry vendor, that's all that you know because she walks up to you and says,

418
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,160
buy mine bloonberry, buy mine bloon, that's hard to say.

419
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
Buy mine blueberries for, they have antioxidants.

420
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,200
And then you are like, fuck yeah, I could use some antioxidants.

421
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,760
My blood is rotten, and you look inside of it and it stones.

422
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:44,880
Small size.

423
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,920
Then I wouldn't buy them.

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
Yeah, I wouldn't buy the small size.

425
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
How sincere is she in her belief that they are blueberries?

426
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Also, wait, is she escaping in a hot air balloon?

427
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,680
Good question.

428
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,040
Not yet, not yet.

429
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
But that is gonna happen at the end.

430
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
How serious is she about that?

431
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
Is she like, I got you, are you punked?

432
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
Dead fucking serious.

433
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Listen, unless you guys have psychic mind reading abilities,

434
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,600
you don't really know firmly how much she believes in her own little game here.

435
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Okay, well then let's play it out.

436
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Teri Hatcher, these aren't blueberries.

437
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm not Teri Hatcher.

438
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,240
What?

439
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,960
I thought you were Teri Hatcher and these were blueberries,

440
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
but you're not Teri Hatcher and the Rocks.

441
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
What's going on?

442
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Am I in vanilla sky?

443
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
She no longer looks like Teri Hatcher.

444
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,760
Who does she look like now?

445
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,200
Now, her face morphs into a mask of pain.

446
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,040
Teri Hatcher can feel pain.

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,960
Wait, you're right.

448
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
I feel like if someone walked up to you guys on the street and said,

449
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,120
hey, got some blueberries, choc-a-block full of anti-oxo dance.

450
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,440
You guys would, and then you look down and there were stones in the basket.

451
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
You would do something, but you're really fucking leaving me out.

452
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
You're really hanging me out to dry right.

453
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,120
If it was me, I would actually probably take one from the basket,

454
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,400
convince I was wrong if there were stones and probably attempted to eat one.

455
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,160
That is literally what I would probably do.

456
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Justin got his right.

457
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I would not be interested because if a human being walked up to me

458
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,640
out of nowhere and offered me any kind of food, I would not be interested.

459
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
Yeah, that's fair in these times.

460
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
I mean, it's just a fit, right?

461
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,160
If someone's like, hey, take some of this food.

462
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,280
I come from a generation where I was told that people put razor blades and apples and shit.

463
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm not going to eat your stone blueberries.

464
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,840
I wouldn't even need them to get that far.

465
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
So while consuming is my anxiety,

466
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,640
if I see somebody on the street with a wicker basket and they look at me

467
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,560
and they start to raise their hand and get through like, hey, I'm gone.

468
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
I assume that basket's full of snakes.

469
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,200
No, it could be full of blueberries for all I care,

470
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
but having to talk to a stranger about their wonderful produce

471
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
is a little bit more than this guy can handle.

472
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
But if they were stones, there's a story there.

473
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Are they pretty stones?

474
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,320
They are blueberry.

475
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
I will give this to Terry Hatcher.

476
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
They are perfectly blueberry sized.

477
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,160
Are they blueberry colored?

478
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah, that's a good question.

479
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
Um, no.

480
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Huh, so they're just like gray?

481
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Grayish, yeah.

482
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,040
But are they round like blueberries?

483
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm saying these things are fucking perfect replicas of blueberries.

484
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,480
So they're like 3D printed?

485
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,800
Yeah.

486
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,920
Also, this Terry Hatcher would be fucking jacked

487
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,840
because this big basket full of stones would be heavy, I bet.

488
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
I would actually rather take a rock from someone than food.

489
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,720
That's good.

490
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
Because then I'm lightening their load.

491
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,480
You know what I mean?

492
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,840
Oh, that's beautiful.

493
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
What if we take a load off Terry?

494
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Take a load free.

495
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
Take a bloob for free.

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Because then think about it,

497
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,240
it's like we're all carrying around wicker baskets of bloob.

498
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
Blueberry shaped stones.

499
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,280
And if everybody would just take one stone from each other,

500
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
we could all share.

501
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
Picture 10 people, Griffin.

502
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,760
Nine of them are Terry Hatcher and one of them isn't.

503
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,800
And the one that's not has a wicker basket full of stones.

504
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,480
And the other nine who are Terry Hatcher don't have any stones.

505
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,320
Now imagine how much easier it would be for non-Terry Hatcher

506
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,040
if those other nine people also carried some stones.

507
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,920
You know what I mean?

508
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,480
Yeah.

509
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,640
And that is communism.

510
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm, I'll be honest, Trav.

511
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,880
I've always wondered what that word means.

512
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
Yeah, that's it.

513
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
When nine Terry Hatchers help out one non-Terry Hatcher.

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Carry their stones.

515
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Is there a fruit that is more exciting to think about

516
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,000
and see a big glistening basket of wet them

517
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,800
than you eat one and you're like, ugh, than blueberries?

518
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,280
No.

519
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,800
Yeah, well, I would include,

520
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
one I can think of would be all berries.

521
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
Whoa, strawberries?

522
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
You look at beautiful raspberry babies

523
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,800
and they have the little tiny berries inside.

524
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Yes.

525
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,920
Little nubbins.

526
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah.

527
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,160
And you pop one in your mouth and it's vulgar.

528
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,400
Yeah.

529
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,920
What's wrong with you?

530
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,840
It's not sweet, not delicious.

531
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
Raspberries is good.

532
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Strawberries is good.

533
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Blackberries, too much work.

534
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,360
And figs.

535
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,720
Come on.

536
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,760
Figs need to stop.

537
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,920
Do y'all know what figs do?

538
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,480
Yeah, make people feel fancier about their bacon.

539
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
Nah, I read this yesterday, it fucked me up.

540
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
Cause I eat fig Newtons.

541
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
Like I party on fig Newtons.

542
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I don't know that I've ever eaten a straight up fig

543
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
and now I definitely won't

544
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,880
cause there's wasps that pollinate them on the inside.

545
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,760
So these dumb ass wasps, they crawl inside the fig

546
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
and then if it's a boy fig,

547
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
which I didn't know that that was a thing,

548
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,760
then the wasp dies inside and their eggs come out

549
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,920
and I guess wasp babies are like, cool, time to party.

550
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,680
But then sometimes they'll climb inside of the girl fig

551
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
and they can't pollinate that and so they just die

552
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
and the fig turns them into more fig.

553
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
Ah, so the fig wins.

554
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,800
Isn't that fucked up?

555
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,120
Wait, so you're saying fig Newtons is wasps?

556
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,120
At some point in the process, you're eating a bit of wasp

557
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
and the wasp is the worst animal.

558
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
Hmm, huh.

559
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm gonna start calling figs wasp coffins

560
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
and then we'll see wasp coffin Newtons

561
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
and then we'll see if anybody eats these things.

562
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,240
You know, I actually kind of would rather

563
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,280
have a wasp coffin at Newton.

564
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,640
Any other fruit jokes?

565
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,920
Any other fruit jokes?

566
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,720
Kiwis, kiwis, what's up with kiwis?

567
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
Kiwis, they're furry, what's that about?

568
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,600
They're furry, they might look like a nut, like a testicle.

569
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh, Griffin, that's vulgar.

570
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,560
Apples, Granny Smith?

571
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,200
No, man, my granny is named Donna, who's Smith.

572
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
Nice, get them.

573
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,720
Yeah.

574
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,520
So that could be good?

575
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
That's something.

576
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,280
Bananas, oh, bananas are pretty,

577
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,920
there's a lot to work with there, isn't there?

578
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
Why?

579
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
Kirk Cameron.

580
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,000
The shape.

581
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:04,880
Oh.

582
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,040
The shape.

583
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,760
Kirk Cameron.

584
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
But they're just like what, like a smile?

585
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,880
No, it's like a, like a pee-pee.

586
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Your penis looks like a banana?

587
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,640
Jesus Christ, go to a doctor.

588
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,800
We're all having fun here.

589
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
My penis does have a stem, though.

590
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
Oh, God, Griffin, wait, at what end?

591
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Hey, hold on.

592
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,440
What's the one right, it's the end right above the candle.

593
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,380
What?

594
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,360
You heard it.

595
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,120
That was you.

596
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,920
I don't think anybody's confused about what's been happening here.

597
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,480
Grapes, I can do a fun thing with grapes, where I put them up in my lips,

598
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,440
and it makes it look like I'm a, like I have buck teeth, like a beaver.

599
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,280
But you obviously can't see that at home.

600
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,480
I recently moved and transferred to-

601
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
Gallagher's got a lot of mileage out of watermelon,

602
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
maybe there's some meat left on the bone.

603
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,640
Here's the new rule, here's the new rule.

604
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,920
If you're dangling, and I try to hand you a,

605
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,960
or kind of a hanger, or, you know, they give,

606
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,080
if I, listen, if I hand you a stool, and you're dangling,

607
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
and you kick that stool away and say,

608
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,040
I got one more bad thing to say, you don't get the stool again.

609
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
You dangle.

610
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,680
Do you think that there was ever like somebody who went to a Gallagher show?

611
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,120
No one listening to this has ever heard of Gallagher.

612
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
We would have more mileage talking about Frasier.

613
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
What if Gallagher hit Frasier with a mallet?

614
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,320
I recently moved and transferred to a new branch of the company I work for.

615
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
Aside from the usual adjustments, it's, fuck.

616
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,080
Aside from the usual adjustments, it's been a surprisingly smooth transition.

617
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
However, one fellow employee constantly feels the need to throw fake punches

618
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,920
accompanied by sound effects at me every time we run into each other.

619
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,120
Fuck, cool, fuck.

620
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,840
It's a restaurant, so this happens 20 to 30 times a day.

621
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,560
Oh, boy.

622
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm fine with the horseplay, but after he's finished,

623
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,040
he'll stop and look at me directly in the eyes

624
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,920
as if he expects me to have a unique reaction every time.

625
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,080
I've been doing fake grunts, oh my God.

626
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,840
And I even pretended to wipe blood off my face a few times,

627
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
but it's been over a month and I'm running out of steam.

628
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
Help me, daunted and Dayton.

629
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
Oh, boy.

630
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,120
Can we not make it harder than it has to be?

631
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,640
Can that be the 2021 slogan?

632
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
Just stop making it harder.

633
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
It's so hard already.

634
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,760
It's so hard already on virtually every level.

635
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,080
And there's people who have a tremendous amount of power and influence

636
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,600
and they're using every inch of it to make it bad.

637
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,760
They don't need our help to make it better with stuff like this.

638
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,280
They simply do not.

639
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,600
I don't know, it sounds like a fun little game to me.

640
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,520
Now, okay, here's what you do.

641
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll solve it for you if you want.

642
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,520
You want it fixed?

643
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,040
I'll fix it.

644
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Just one time, lean in and force this person to punch you in the face.

645
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,680
Yeah.

646
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,240
Huh.

647
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,920
At just when they're about to rear back for a big fake punch-o,

648
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,840
you lean in real hard and get deck square in the jaw.

649
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,480
End of game.

650
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,720
Yeah.

651
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
End of job for that person, I bet.

652
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,800
No, you say, I'm not going to press job charges.

653
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
They don't need to lose their job.

654
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,000
You're not going to go to boss jail.

655
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,680
No, I'm not pressing job charges.

656
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,320
It's fine.

657
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Just don't pretend.

658
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
I love the game.

659
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
No, don't get me wrong.

660
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,760
I love the game.

661
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360
You fucked it up.

662
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,960
You fucked it up.

663
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,760
You ruined it.

664
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,280
And now the boss is on our case about it.

665
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,880
What if you complained to your boss and there was a sign up?

666
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,160
It's like, hey, no one in particular, but stop pretending to punch people.

667
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,760
Well, I'll tell you the problem.

668
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,480
The problem isn't so very physical.

669
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,400
What if you pretend to poison each other?

670
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,160
All right.

671
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,640
All right.

672
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah.

673
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,280
Or you pretend to the eye of old age.

674
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,480
That's cool too, Travis.

675
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Badass like fucking hand in hand and on two cots in the break room.

676
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,400
That's awesome.

677
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,920
Here's what you do.

678
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,720
Next time he's taken some fake slings at you, you don't react.

679
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,920
You stand there stone faced.

680
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
And he's going to kind of pause and like, what has changed?

681
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
And you're going to point to your completely empty wrist and say,

682
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
I got this force field generator.

683
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,320
And then you walk away.

684
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,520
That's cool.

685
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,080
Game.

686
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,720
Game's over.

687
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
And then if he's like, what's that?

688
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,600
You say like, I can't hear you.

689
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,960
Do I incredibly potent force field.

690
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,480
And also I can't breathe through it.

691
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
This is a venomous thing through it.

692
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,560
So you have to free me.

693
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm going to pass away now.

694
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,360
And I don't want to do it in front of you because it's embarrassing.

695
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,040
I heard you poop yourself right there.

696
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,000
A real boob.

697
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,760
So I'm just going to climb in the dumpster.

698
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,640
So I don't inconvenience anybody.

699
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Throw my dead ass body in the dumpster behind the Applebee's when I die.

700
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.

701
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Don't go through the trouble.

702
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,320
I know you're referencing the Joe Diffie track,

703
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
prop me up beside the jukebox when I die.

704
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Joe Diffie did die this year.

705
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,040
And I wonder if there was a moment

706
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,000
where his loved ones looked around each other and were like,

707
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
shit, so we're not, we're not going to.

708
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,560
I probably forced a hard conversation with Willie Nelson's family

709
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,880
when they were like, so is this a living will?

710
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,600
Do we really have to roll you up and smoke you grandpa?

711
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,040
Grandpa, I wicked don't want to smoke you grandpa.

712
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,640
I love you so much.

713
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
I love you so much grandpa.

714
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't want your dust getting all up in my lungs.

715
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, anyway.

716
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,480
Are we just going to be very tired until the episode after the election?

717
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
I'm not tired.

718
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,840
I'm just getting warmed up.

719
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
I just have a cold sore on my lip.

720
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,560
It's making it difficult for me to bring some of my choice characters.

721
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,520
You know, Mr. F, the guy who only makes F sounds.

722
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,720
I can't even do that character right now because this cold sore is so bad.

723
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,200
It sucks.

724
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,520
Anyway, you guys do the money zone because my lips hurt.

725
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,800
Trav, you like to do this one.

726
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,040
I'm not going to take that from you.

727
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah, you do.

728
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
You like them.

729
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,520
Okay, here we go.

730
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,160
Honey, shopping online is hard.

731
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:08,400
You are my integrated app.

732
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,800
Yeah.

733
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,680
And you save me lots of bugs.

734
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:11,920
Okay.

735
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,960
Browser extension.

736
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,200
Honey, you're a browser extension.

737
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,440
Here's the fucking deal.

738
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,400
You have this browser.

739
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,520
And you save me lots of cash.

740
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,520
I saved some cash over the weekend with this.

741
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:36,080
That's, it's maybe not like the most sort of earth shattering endorsement,

742
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,680
but I was shopping and I was about to buy a thing that was like 80 bucks.

743
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,000
And then Honey bleeped in and Honey was like,

744
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,280
oh, hold up, hold up, hold up.

745
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,240
60, boop.

746
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,800
Thanks, Honey.

747
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,520
Whoa.

748
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,400
Thanks for, I literally did nothing to earn that.

749
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,920
But you did it for me.

750
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640

That one doesn't work quite as good.

762
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,720
Not quite as good.

763
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,120
You can use any computer to print official US postage 24 seven

764
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,960

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,920
schedule a pickup or drop it on mailbox.

767
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,120
It's that simple.

768
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,800
And with, what?

769
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,040
You.

770
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,800
What do you want to send Griffin?

771
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,520
What do you want to mail today?

772
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,600
I want to mail a letter.

773
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,520
No, that's fine.

774
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,000
That's fine.

775
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,080
It might be, is it an important letter?

776
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,600
It's from Justin to Kelly.

777
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,880
Oh, okay.

00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,280

785
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
It's, oh, sorry.

786
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,280
Do you want to do one for Blue Apron?

787
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Oh, I love to eat.

788
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,040
And there's no better way to eat than food that you made yourself.

789
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:40,720
I, for instance, yes, last week, this previous week, enjoyed a sort of a ground beef

790
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,200
with noodles and it sounded better when they put all the adjectives in there.

791
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,560
I know I'm kind of making it sound like shift where D, but it was Blue Apron

792
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
and I made it myself.

793
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,280
Was it Blue Apron's yummy ground beef noodles?

794
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,400
Oh, I love those.

795
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,480
That's my favorite, Justin.

796
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,640
Did it have some kind of sauce with it or is it just dry beef and dry noodles?

797
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,360
Sometimes it's Romanesco, love that stuff.

798
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,800
Chimichurri can't get enough.

799
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,280
Pretty good.

800
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Did it come with any sides, Justin?

801
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Did it have a bit of vegetable with it?

802
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
Oh, there's always a vegetable, which I love.

803
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,440
I love that because I like to have a balanced meal.

804
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,000
September, this month, I've enjoyed so many delicious recipes.

805
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,720
Turkey burgers.

806
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,440
Oh my God.

807
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
I just remember turkey burgers with lemongrass and ginger in them.

808
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,280
Are you kidding me?

809
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,560
Shut up.

810
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,040
And you can make it easily with just a few simple kitchen tools.

811
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
You see pictures right there on the box and a recipe with photos.

812
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
So you know exactly what you're doing.

813
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,400
If you want to start cooking for yourself more, if you're tired of the carryout options

814
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,600
around you and you want to try something different, this is the place to start with Blue Apron.

815
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
This fall, don't settle for sameness.

816
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,240
Change things up with Blue Apron's variety of delicious season-make recipes.

817
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,640
Check out this week's menu and get $30 off across your first two deliveries

818
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,520
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

819
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,920
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

820
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,960
Also blapron.com does still work.

821
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,600
Blapron.

822
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,080
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

823
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,760
They give you food.

824
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

825
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,240
Oh, that was lazy.

826
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
You got to cook it yourself.

827
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Hello there, ghouls and gals.

828
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
It is I, April Wolf.

829
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm here to take you through the twisty, scary, heart-pounding world of genre cinema

830
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,280
on the exhilarating program known as Switchblade Sisters.

831
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
The concept is simple.

832
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,360
I invite a female filmmaker on each week and we discuss their favorite genre film.

833
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,400
Listen in closely to hear past guests like the Babadook director Jennifer Kent,

834
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,040
Winter's Bone director Deborah Granik,

835
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,040
and so many others every Thursday on maximumfun.org.

836
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
Tune in if you dare.

837
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,840
It's actually a very thought-provoking show that deeply explores the craft and philosophy

838
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,040
behind the filmmaking process while also examining film through the lens of the female gaze.

839
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,720
So, like, you should listen.

840
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
Switchblade Sisters.

841
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

842
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,320
My song wasn't done.

843
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,160
It was.

844
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,360
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

845
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,600
Oh?

846
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,840
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

847
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,880
I want to munch.

848
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
Squad.

849
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,920
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

850
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
I want to munch.

851
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,720
Squad.

852
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,280
Justin, you might need to have a word with your guitarist.

853
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,960
He's kind of riffing a little there, stealing a little attention.

854
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,200
He's in a different tuning.

855
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,840
He's doing open D.

856
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
He's trying to jaw focus.

857
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
He's on that Nick Drake shit.

858
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
He's in that Nick Drake open D beautiful.

859
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,160
Okay.

860
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,600
It's that drop D tuning.

861
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,240
So listen, I got a few, like, just brief stories I want to share.

862
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,200
Oh, this is nice.

863
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,240
Yeah, just some brief stories.

864
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,120
Tim Hortons is giving away pumpkins with beverage orders.

865
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,960
If you're at a Tim Hortons in the US and you buy pumpkin spice beverage through the Tim

866
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,480
Hortons app, when you go and pick it up,

867
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,600
they're going to give you a pumpkin.

868
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Whether you want one or not.

869
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,200
No matter what you do, if you get a pumpkin spice latte, a pumpkin spice ice cap, whatever,

870
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,560
they don't care.

871
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,840
They're going to put a pumpkin in your car.

872
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,320
Wow.

873
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,080
If you try to leave it in the restaurant, they will chase you through the parking lot

874
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,320
with a pumpkin saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, your pumpkin.

875
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,280
They will find you.

876
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,520
If you go through the drive-thru and don't stop to get your pumpkin, when you get home,

877
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,840
you're going to open the back door and there's the pumpkin.

878
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,840
And you're going to throw that pumpkin in the fire, but then later tonight when you go to bed,

879
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,400
you're going to pull back the covers and there's the pumpkin, brand new, whole, once again.

880
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,000
You're going to make a wish and the pumpkin's going to rot before your very eyes in a matter

881
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,480
of seconds.

882
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,720
But be careful what you wish for because the pumpkin is very literal.

883
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:48,960
Yeah.

884
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,000
Next story from Joseph requires a little bit of cultural education.

885
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Do you know what Kraft Mac and Cheese is called in Canada?

886
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,080
No.

887
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Kraft Dinner.

888
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
Thank you, Travis.

889
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,960
Pumpkin Spice KD is coming to Canada this fall.

890
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,680
That's not my acronym.

891
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,320
It's theirs.

892
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,840
In one of the more unlikely partnerships of 2020, Kraft Dinner has announced they're unveiling

893
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Pumpkin Spice KD.

894
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,240
Wait, what's the partnership?

895
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,160
Kraft and Pumpkins?

896
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,000
Kraft and Pumpkins.

897
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:30,480
Hitting shelves in Canada this October, Pumpkin Spice KD is made with the same classic KD cheese

898
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,600
powder Canadians know and love, as well as the addition of fall flavors, including hints

899
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,160
of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.

900
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,040
Ew.

901
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,160
While some may feel the combination is not something they're interested in trying, others

902
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,720
are, as Canadians have already begun signing up to try the new concoction.

903
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,760
You have to sign up?

904
00:40:51,760 --> 00:41:01,040
Well, okay, Joseph, who sent this in to the Munch Squad tip line, said the cowards are

905
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,960
only making a thousand boxes of the stuff.

906
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Someone from the company was on the radio saying they have a waitlist of over 10,000

907
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,160
people waiting to try it.

908
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,600
So I don't know.

909
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720
People are dying for it.

910
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,800
Here's the quote.

911
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,720
KD has always been known for one of a kind cheesy taste.

912
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,000
And after years of watching Canadians get excited for Pumpkin Spice season, we felt

913
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,640
that it was time to combine these two iconic flavors and create Pumpkin Spice KD.

914
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,840
It was time to cash in.

915
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,320
Cash in on the KD.

916
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,040
This, this is good.

917
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,800
Canadians have always made KD their own way, and not many people would expect KD to be

918
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,480
part of the PSL conversation, but that's the whole point.

919
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
What?

920
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,840
Only one.

921
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,680
You heard me.

922
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,480
That's the whole point, because it's so wild.

923
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
Only a thousand will be made.

924
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,600
So move over lattes and muffins.

925
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,760
PSKD is the new must try flavor this fall.

926
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,720
This is vulgar.

927
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,160
Maybe people will buy a box of it and they'll sell it on eBay for a lot of money.

928
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,440
And then that song of I had a million dollars, we wouldn't have to eat Kraft Dinner, but

929
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,280
we would finally be able to eat the Kraft Dinner that is seasoned with Pumpkin Spice.

930
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,720
So this next to last story is one a lot of people sent in, and I just wanted to do it

931
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,320
so I would stop getting emails about it.

932
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,440
Red Lobster and PepsiCo have kicked off a new relationship with the Dew Garita, the

933
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,120
first Mountain Dew cocktail.

934
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Finally.

935
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,160
Why is Red Lobster the one?

936
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
Why wouldn't Red Lobster be the one?

937
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,080
Well, Griffin, Red Lobster and Pepsi have been dancing around each other for a while

938
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:50,080
now, and we're all thinking time to just get to it and get to fucking, by which I mean

939
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,800
create a Mountain Dew based cocktail that goes with any lobster based dish.

940
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Okay.

941
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,480
I, this is the first, sorry, I should be clear.

942
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,280
This is the first official Mountain Dew cocktail.

943
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,760
See, because I know at least, for example, the first time I ever got drunk was on a

944
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,440
cocktail I created made of Popov Vodka and Mountain Dew Code Red.

945
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,800
So that might've been the, that was never adopted officially by the company.

946
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
Halo juice is what you called it.

947
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,000
Fucking landfill, baby.

948
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,480
You can call it Code Red Square.

949
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,440
That's actually not bad.

950
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,680
Red Lobster and PepsiCo are teaming to create exciting new ways to enjoy great seafood.

951
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,840
A long way, I guess you had to bring that yourself to the Red Lobster with the great

952
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,760
taste and variety of PepsiCo products.

953
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,320
The duo will leverage their iconic food and beverage brands to create a variety of craveable

954
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,560
new menu items, starting with the Dewgarita, the first Mountain Dew cocktail.

955
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,480
God help me, friends.

956
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,800
If you wake up in the morning craving a Dewgarita, go back to bed.

957
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,760
Try again tomorrow.

958
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,280
Want something better.

959
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,160
Want better.

960
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,400
Dream bigger.

961
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,900
Bigger.

962
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,480
The Dewgarita pairs perfectly with Red Lobster's iconic cheddar bay biscuits.

963
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,960
How's that?

964
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,560
It's the new fucking official, official.

965
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,360
My friends.

966
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,720
Dirt, Dirt.

967
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,880
It's the new official.

968
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
My dear friends.

969
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,360
It's the new official hor d'oeuvres for dirt bags.

970
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
It's Dewgarita.

971
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Hey, I'm Travis McElroy representing Red Lobster for 2021.

972
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,120
This year, we just skipped all the trouble.

973
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,840
We soaked the cheddar bay biscuits in the Dewgarita.

974
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,000
You can just pick yourself up a soaking wet cheddar bay biscuit,

975
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,880
horse the whole thing down, get the job done right.

976
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,360
If I was standing in an infinite warehouse with infinite type writers manned by infinite

977
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,520
monkeys and I stood up front, I gave the prompt, okay, you silly guys.

978
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,840
What beverage, what liquid, potable liquid on earth would you pair with Red Lobster's

979
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,760
cheddar bay biscuits?

980
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,600
Never, never would somebody be like, oh, I'm thinking the alcohol.

981
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,080
So maybe a margarita, but instead of like the regular margarita stuff, a Mountain Dew

982
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,120
mixed in there because that will contrast the notes of cheddar and bay and biscuit.

983
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,360
It's fart cutery is what we call it.

984
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:30,160
Made using a top secret recipe, this refreshingly fun cocktail will begin rolling out to select

985
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,280
Red Lobster restaurants in September and will be available nationwide by the end of 2020,

986
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
which is sounds more of a like a threat.

987
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,400
The Red Lobster and PepsiCo innovation teams are quickly working together to leverage iconic

988
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,840
PepsiCo brands across the Frito-Lay and Quaker range of products to create tasty menu items.

989
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,240
Look forward to Wilford Brimley's Quaker Oatsquares old fashions.

990
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,880
Oh, I like how you've dusted the rim.

991
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,360
Fritosmopolitan, that's a cosmopolitan made with Fritos.

992
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,920
If you guys have any others from the Frito-Lay family of products, please let me know.

993
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,800
Fritosmopolitan, that's a Frito cosmopolitan.

994
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,600
Sorry, you guys are lagging out.

995
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,160
I'm not hearing the words.

996
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,200
Mark Dorito.

997
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,880
What's that?

998
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,160
Oh, Mark Dorito.

999
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,800
Okay, that's fine.

1000
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,120
We've actually already done a Mark Dorito one.

1001
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,160
Red Lobster guests will also be able to enjoy a broad range of beverages,

1002
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:38,160
a broad range of beverages from PepsiCo, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew,

1003
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,600
and stubborn craft soda, as well as bubbly sparkling water,

1004
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:50,080
Life Water, Tropicana, and non-carbonated options like lemonade and agua fresca.

1005
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Hey, so you're just saying that you'll still have-

1006
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,360
So what they said in this paragraph is that this will not be the only drink-

1007
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,160
Don't you worry.

1008
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,480
If you choose to take the coward's way out, you don't have the drink the doogarita.

1009
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,200
Fucking red lobsters, the coward.

1010
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,520
If you're going to introduce a doogarita into your fucking lineup, make it mandatory, damn it.

1011
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,720
Hey, man, if you don't drink the doog, then you don't drink a red lobster.

1012
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
There's people out there who don't drink alcohol,

1013
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,640
there's people out there who don't drink Mountain Dew,

1014
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,480
and neither of those people are welcome at Red Lobster for the next couple months.

1015
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,520
So pull up to the trough, get yourself a drink,

1016
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,800
and over here, we just got a big pile of cheddar bay biscuits, tear in.

1017
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,080
If you are willingly eating inside of a red lobster,

1018
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,880
currently you should be forced to drink a doogarita.

1019
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,840
That should be good.

1020
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,640
That's good because it'll kill all the germs in your body.

1021
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,120
Sure.

1022
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,400
Red Lobster and PepsiCo, we found the vaccine, but the bad news is it's doogaritas.

1023
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,080
We can save them, but at what cost?

1024
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,320
I'm not sure.

1025
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,400
Gosh, let me think about it.

1026
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,440
Red Lobster and PepsiCo both understand how much food and beverages

1027
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,480
enhance memorable moments from casual gathering.

1028
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,800
Do you remember during COVID when we went and drank fucking doogaritas and got COVID there?

1029
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,080
That was so weird.

1030
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,000
But casually, so it's like, doesn't even count.

1031
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,480
With both our brands on deck to wow guests,

1032
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,840
we can't wait to dream up more phenomenal flavor pairings together

1033
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,800
to bring some very special offerings and experiences to the table.

1034
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,680
Red Lobster and PepsiCo also share a common passion for sustainability.

1035
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1036
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,040
Create sustainability for everything other than the human race, sensibly.

1037
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,200
Aiming to create a more environmentally friendly experiences for guests.

1038
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,760
Both companies are partners with the Ocean Conservancy and Trash Free Seas Alliance.

1039
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,560
Trash Free Seas, Trash Full Red Lobsters.

1040
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,360
That's my motto.

1041
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,960
What we do is every time we harvest a Mountain Dew, we plant two more.

1042
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,080
Don't worry about it.

1043
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,440
Any trash that we find in your oceans, we just bring you straight into the restaurant

1044
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,520
and find out a way to make you into a margarita.

1045
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,920
Their relationship will leverage the goals of both companies

1046
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,400
to incorporate more sustainable packaging and distribution techniques of the future.

1047
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,640
I want my Dewgarita in a little plastic pouch

1048
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,560
like they used to put milk in in elementary school.

1049
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,480
They have to jab with a straw.

1050
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,680
That's how I want it.

1051
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,280
Just a big communal cup.

1052
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,000
Just get rid of the water in the tank with the lobsters in it that you pick,

1053
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,040
which one you want to eat and fill that with Dewgarita

1054
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,600
and then whatever you can scoop out of there with two hands.

1055
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,200
Put the lobsters back in because they'd want a party.

1056
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,840
Listen.

1057
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,560
And also because we can't have water in this building at all

1058
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,480
or else people are going to be tempted to drink it.

1059
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,720
Not a drop.

1060
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,600
Not a drop.

1061
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,120
Now, let me tell you, boys.

1062
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,720
I'm a simple man and I enjoy the simple pleasures.

1063
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,120
I've enjoyed shrimp.

1064
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,080
The endless shrimp is one of life's great joys as far as I'm concerned.

1065
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,560
I've enjoyed a red lobster before.

1066
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,760
First restaurant we ever took Charlie to,

1067
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,440
my first daughter was at the shrimp vortex of endless shrimp.

1068
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,320
That's true.

1069
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,160
I attempted to consume 100.

1070
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,760
I think I made it to 85.

1071
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,200
It was the worst day of my life.

1072
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,160
It was not great.

1073
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,920
But I enjoy a cheddar-baked biscuit.

1074
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,420
Sure.

1075
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,840
Worth is not the year of our Lord 2020

1076
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,640
and perhaps any other time in existence

1077
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,360
would I be tempted to attend a feast at Red Lobster

1078
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,440
and indulge perhaps in a Dewgarita.

1079
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,360
Why are you talking like this?

1080
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,040
Because I'm a classic boy who-

1081
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,800
You're a classic classy boy?

1082
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,080
Yeah.

1083
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,880
What the fuck?

1084
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,240
You were just speaking like an old English bard.

1085
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,480
Yep.

1086
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,760
That character went so hard in the paint for so long.

1087
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,920
That's a classy boy.

1088
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,640
There was a-

1089
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,040
It's such a thin sliver that people were probably listening like,

1090
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,640
this must be a reference to something.

1091
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
That's just one of those fancy lads

1092
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,960
that you see eating at Red Lobster any other time except now.

1093
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,840
But there had to be a point when you were saying all that stuff

1094
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,640
when you were like,

1095
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,640
man, I've been doing this wild voice for a long time

1096
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,240
and it doesn't make much sense,

1097
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,320
but I can't possibly stop now.

1098
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,680
Can I tell you what's weird, Griffin?

1099
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah.

1100
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,640
I didn't notice.

1101
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,520
You didn't notice?

1102
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,800
I wasn't so much doing the voice as the voice was doing me.

1103
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,600
Wow.

1104
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,720
Yeah, like I just became the classic classy boy.

1105
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,040
Yeah.

1106
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,240
And like, I don't know what to tell you.

1107
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,760
I feel like the voice did all of us.

1108
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,520
I recently made cheddar bay biscuits at home.

1109
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,320
Okay?

1110
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,960
Yeah.

1111
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,440
Yeah.

1112
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,760
Is that okay with you, Dad?

1113
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,160
I did that in cooking class in high school.

1114
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,560
It was-

1115
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,160
Yeah, they're easy.

1116
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,000
I ordered, can I tell you guys something?

1117
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,320
Yeah.

1118
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
We were talking about if we weren't in,

1119
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,120
I don't, there's actually-

1120
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,200
The year of our Lord 2020?

1121
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,480
Yeah.

1122
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,080
I ordered on eBay.

1123
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,760
I ordered, there's this new smart food popcorn

1124
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,680
that has Cap'n Crunch Berries in it.

1125
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,080
Okay.

1126
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,240
And I really wanted to try it

1127
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,600
because Dan, my co-host of my cereal podcast,

1128
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,880
The Empty Bowl, he had tried it.

1129
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,080
So I wanted to try it

1130
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,600
because I want to try everything that Dan tries.

1131
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
So I couldn't find it.

1132
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,640
Dan jumped off a bridge?

1133
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,680
Would you jump off a bridge?

1134
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,320
I mean, if you needed me to rescue him or something.

1135
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,120
No, it's bridge, Dan.

1136
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,680
I couldn't find them in stores

1137
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,720
because I don't really go to stores looking for popcorn.

1138
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,640
So I got some off eBay for three bags.

1139
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,360
I got some off eBay and they were shipped to my home.

1140
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,080
And when I opened them, there was,

1141
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,120
I just wanted to say there was a envelope

1142
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,040
and I opened the envelope

1143
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,160
and there was a handwritten thank you note inside

1144
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,680
that said, thank you for buying this popcorn.

1145
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,360
I hope you find it delicious.

1146
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,760
And also inside there were four baseball cards.

1147
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,640
I just thought that was so nice.

1148
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,320
I fucking love eBay bonuses.

1149
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,120
Yeah, just here's one thing I always do is baseball cards.

1150
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,160
So there's four baseball cards.

1151
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,200
Love the captain.

1152
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,720
That's awesome.

1153
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Yeah, I just thought it was a nice little story.

1154
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,560
I wanted to share a little bright spot.

1155
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,800
All right.

1156
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,880
Yeah, I got some bottle caps in a toy that I found.

1157
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,920
I bought a toy and it came with bottle caps.

1158
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,080
And yeah, you can do a lot with those.

1159
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,360
Turn them into pins or caps-y.

1160
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,400
I like to fling them.

1161
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,120
You kind of put them between your thumb and your finger

1162
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,760
and you fling them.

1163
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,800
Can I do a quick Yahoo, please?

1164
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,360
I love that.

1165
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:39,760
Yes, please.

1166
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,160
It's sent in by Emma Cant.

1167
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,560
Thanks, Emma.

1168
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,960
It's Yahoo Answers user Drishti asks,

1169
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,600
hey guys, can somebody suggest me names

1170
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,600
for some grand mansion like Thornhill of Riverdale?

1171
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,080
Thanks.

1172
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,240
I'm now realizing that this is the name of a building

1173
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,880
or a state from the TV show Riverdale

1174
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,000
and that there's not a place in the earth

1175
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,400
called Thornhill of Riverdale.

1176
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,560
Or is there?

1177
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah, you don't know that.

1178
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,760
Could be.

1179
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,840
Here's the thing that I love about this.

1180
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,640
At some point, there are some fancy ass houses out there,

1181
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,800
you guys, with these fancy ass names.

1182
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,240
At some point, if you have a mansion called Thornhill,

1183
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,400
it didn't come with that name.

1184
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,240
Like somebody built this house and said,

1185
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,000
my house gets a name now.

1186
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,360
And I like that.

1187
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,800
I think we should do that more.

1188
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,240
I have a name for my house.

1189
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,320
I have a name for my house.

1190
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,840
I'm not going to dox myself.

1191
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,120
Well, my house name isn't registered anywhere, Justin.

1192
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,440
You can't.

1193
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,600
No, it's registered.

1194
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,800
You can name your house.

1195
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,000
It doesn't ever matter.

1196
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
You can always name your house.

1197
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,920
You should name me.

1198
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,840
Everybody should name your house right now.

1199
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,120
You don't live at an address.

1200
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,320
You live in a state.

1201
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,280
Just name your state.

1202
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,200
It's just about naming it.

1203
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,240
You can do whatever you want.

1204
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,880
All right.

1205
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,160
Let's just come up with some good, like,

1206
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,720
Riverdale.

1207
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,560
Feathertail.

1208
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,120
Are we just going to rhyme things with Riverdale?

1209
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,320
Because we could do that all day.

1210
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,840
Heathertail.

1211
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,640
Okay.

1212
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,480
Stratford upon Avon.

1213
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,600
Leather, Leatherwhale.

1214
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,240
Thistleclaw, Thistleclaw.

1215
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,320
Hey, are we doing warrior cat names?

1216
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,920
Just Justin.

1217
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,880
If you're Justin, if you're looking at a list of warrior cat names,

1218
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,240
you legally have to tell us.

1219
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,680
Ravenclaw.

1220
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,520
I'm saying it's another Graystripe of Huntington.

1221
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,720
I think what you should do, you should have more fun with it.

1222
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,600
Because you could do an old stuffy name, right?

1223
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,040
But you could also call it like Party Town, right?

1224
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,080
Or just like, you could just like termite damage, you know?

1225
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,680
Like have a fun name.

1226
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,440
No, it's got to be a compound word.

1227
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,720
It does?

1228
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,840
Okay, how about Batman.

1229
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,520
Batman.

1230
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,800
This is Batman the house.

1231
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,160
It's pretty moody in there.

1232
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,560
No theme whatsoever on the outside or the inside.

1233
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,000
This is my house Batman.

1234
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,520
It just has Batman energy.

1235
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,640
Big Batman energy.

1236
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,600
Just when I see it, I think Batman.

1237
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,440
See, you know what sucks?

1238
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,240
Is a really cool name for a house is Brookstone.

1239
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,560
But that's already a shop.

1240
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,600
Ikea.

1241
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,960
I'm gonna be straight with you.

1242
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,720
I'm having trouble focusing on this question

1243
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,560
because I was just thinking about Riverdale

1244
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,640
and how I did used to watch that show.

1245
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,400
But then I quit watching it.

1246
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,680
There was an episode during this story arc

1247
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,720
where there was a murderer who was murdering people

1248
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,360
in the town of Riverdale.

1249
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,600
And like killed a couple people.

1250
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,640
And Archie got pretty PO'd about that.

1251
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,240
I was gonna say Archie got killed

1252
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,400
which would have been a really brave move.

1253
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,640
No, but what Archie did

1254
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,760
cause he didn't like that there are people getting murdered

1255
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,360
is he got a bunch of his friends

1256
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,040
and they put on red masks

1257
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,680
and were shirtless in his garage

1258
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,120
and they filmed themselves.

1259
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,680
And Archie was basically like,

1260
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,280
hey, serial killer.

1261
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,480
If you don't stop, we're gonna kill you.

1262
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,560
And I was like, I think I might be done watching this.

1263
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,000
That's the wildest thing for a person to ever do

1264
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,040
that I don't think I can hang

1265
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,560
with this show's energy anymore.

1266
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,240
Griffin, what is your criteria for watching a show then?

1267
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,720
Because that for me is where I am now

1268
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,840
for the first time interested in watching Riverdale.

1269
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,760
Apparently it's got real magic in it now

1270
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,760
and I don't, that's whatever, but I wanna.

1271
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,880
Does Jughead do magic?

1272
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,680
That's exciting.

1273
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,560
I want a teen boys anti-murder club

1274
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,360
who goes out and if there's people doing killing

1275
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,080
we do killing on them first.

1276
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,840
Well, it sounds like at least they gave a warning

1277
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,280
and serial killers don't do that.

1278
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,080
Dexter never did that.

1279
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,520
And we're clearly shirtless

1280
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,080
so you can see that our football bodies

1281
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,960
could hurt your body killer person.

1282
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,040
Unless the killer person, I don't know,

1283
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,800
maybe is more in shape

1284
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,200
or has more friends than Archie.

1285
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,960
But that's not possible.

1286
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,320
Archie has a lot of friends.

1287
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,120
Very popular.

1288
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,560
Jughead alone could take down a murderer too.

1289
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,000
You didn't finish watching it

1290
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,200
but do you think it turned out

1291
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,240
that Jughead was the murderer?

1292
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,360
Was the murderer.

1293
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,000
Yeah.

1294
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Murdering for hamburger money, I assume.

1295
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,160
I haven't watched the show but I've read the comics.

1296
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,320
The podcast is over.

1297
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,460
Okay.

1298
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
Thanks for listening to My Brother My Brother

1299
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:38,800
made it magic for the modern era.

1300
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,040
I didn't know we could just do that.

1301
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,320
Yeah, I can do it.

1302
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,520
I actually have the power.

1303
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,080
Oh, okay.

1304
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,920
Next time do it like 15 minutes in.

1305
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,000
No, we have to do enough comedy

1306
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,680
to keep this nation afloat.

1307
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,080
That's a lot of pressure on us.

1308
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,720
Yeah.

1309
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,080
Don't be afraid.

1310
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,200
Embrace the challenge.

1311
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,380
Okay.

1312
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,360
Do you guys want to say anything?

1313
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:01,860
I do.

1314
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,400
In closing, I have a couple things.

1315
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,960
First, there's going to be some really great

1316
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,080
new merch out this week.

1317
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,880
Over at mcrormerch.com, we're bringing back

1318
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,680
the pin of the month.

1319
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,840
And this month we're doing a tiger on the table

1320
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,480
pin of the month designed by Sam Schultz.

1321
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,640
And the proceeds for that are going to go to benefit

1322
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,600
the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, which defends

1323
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,920
and protects the human rights of black transgender

1324
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,920
and gender non-conforming people.

1325
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,160
And the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which works

1326
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,000
to guarantee that all people are free to determine

1327
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
their gender identity and expression.

1328
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,280

We have a book coming out that is all about

1334
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,640

some stuff with New York Comic Con all digitally,

1345

not in person because we are responsible.

1346
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,480

1354
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,200
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Longwinders

1355
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,320
for the use for our theme song.

1356
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1357
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,600
It's very good and the song is good and the album is good.

1358
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,800

01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,640
Y'all want that final?

1363
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,920
Oh, yeah.

1364
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,200
One more thing, just a little thing.

1365
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,760
Yeah.

1366
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,720
Theresa and I are doing a little watch-along kind of podcast

1367
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,080
thing for Great British Bake Off.

1368
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,680
We're posting the episodes up on our YouTube channel,

1369
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,200
the McElroy Family YouTube channel.

1370
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,200
It's called Bake On.

1371
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,160
Is it video?

1372
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,960
Well, it's got a static image with audio on it.

1373
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,320
Okay.

1374
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,680
Yeah, so you can go and listen on YouTube.

1375
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,960
It's really cute and funny.

1376
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,200
Um, hey, here comes that, man, I was going to read this final,

1377
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,320
but then like when you're looking at Yahoo Answers,

1378
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,160
there's like stories that appear on top,

1379
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,440
like little news stories.

1380
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,000
And I don't know, one of them is even better than any final Yahoo

1381
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,400
I could do because the headline of this story is

1382
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,800
Dennis Quaid is over Cancel Culture.

1383
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:58,720
Okay.

1384
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1385
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1386
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,320
My name is Griffin McElroy.

1387
