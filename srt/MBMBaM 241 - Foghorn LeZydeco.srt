1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and the advice show for the

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,880
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby baby, Griffin the Swamp Thing McElroy. Hey, Swamp Thing,

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,680
we're so happy you could make it on the program. Get off that hoverboat, what's you afraid of?

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,680
You're gonna get your feet all swampy, that's a good Earth down in there. Justin, stop interrupting

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,240
him, just let him talk like that. Join my hydration specialist, Griffin McElroy. Grab

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,040
yourself a hurricane, baby, grab yourself a- wait, where am I going now? Where in the world is-

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Griffin, hold on tight, this magic carpet of axes is backing hard. Is it gonna be the deep

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,920
south? Wait, where is this house? Is this Florida? Griffin's just fluctuating back and forth across

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
the Gulf of Mexico. I'm a mystified Floridian, and I've never seen anything like this before.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:53,520
And on here we go, back to the Zatarans. All right, Foghorn Lozitico, maybe you could tell

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,120
us why your accent has been so impacted. I just got back from Nolans, where I had myself a lot of

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,200
ratatouille. On the plane there, I watched the movie Ratatouille. I went down to Nolans,

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,960
and a mouse cooked me all my meat. I walked around for like fucking 100 miles, because they

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,880
haven't invented public transportation yet down in Nolans, and I did develop myself a hemorrhoid

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,600
big enough to draw a face on. A lot of times when you're in New Orleans, you will ask that a mouse

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
prepare your food, but you really need to go back into the kitchen to make sure, because they will

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,080
try to tell you that a mouse has prepared your food. A lot of times, it's a possum. It's not even

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
a mouse. Or it's a guy named Possum. Got myself a flank steak, 16 ounces. How's a mouse even gonna

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,520
pick up something that big? You tell me that. You can't do it. Don't be afraid of this swamp water.

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,800
Did you take Traveler? Oh God, yeah. That's Savannah, Georgia. Well, no, you can do that.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,960
As long as it's an open plastic container, you can drink whatever the fuck. You can drink heroin

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,480
out of it, as long as it's an open solo cup. Did you get into any voodoo? No, I didn't.

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,040
Did you eat any voodoo donuts? I ate 12 voodoo donuts, and every time I did, a bigger donut

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:28,960
was destroyed. That's how it works. Travis was staring at that big donut out in LA,

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,280
and it just all of a sudden started evaporating. It just got completely wrecked. I assume Griffin

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,600
traveled back in time and stopped the donuts' parents from eating. With a time-traveling

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,880
voodoo donut. What are we doing? I don't know. This sounds like we're reciting the lyrics of

33
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:52,960
a Cherry Pomadaddy's record. Time-traveling voodoo donuts. Come on out with the flank steak made by

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,800
a mouse. Okay. That's where Brian sets her territory. You know what, Kmart? This is worth

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,440
the $3.99 I paid for the CD. I'm glad I made this versus this is a worthy follow-up. No,

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,920
I had a terrific time in Nolens. I was kidding about going near swamp water. Not so much about

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,560
the hemorrhoid. If you haven't listened to our podcast before, what we do is we take your

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,440
questions, we mix them up with a little Cajun spice, and then we turn them into wisdom. Got

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,120
that. Got that Creole comedy. Creole comedy. Right here on my brother, my brother and me.

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,840
Let's get into it. Every time I hold open two doors in a row, like walking out of a shopping

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,880
mall, I'm not sure if I should expect the person to thank me twice or if the initial thank you for

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
the first door is implied for the second door. Vice versa, if someone holds open two doors for

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,200
me, should I say thank you both times or just the one for everything? That's from the curious,

44
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,160
courteous Canuck in Canada. I'm confused by the question because me too. I always understood it

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,680
to be whoever holds the first door door walks through the second door while you hold it.

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Right. So a World War Two veteran, a 102 year old World War Two veteran, you say,

47
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,640
hey, Frank, what the fuck? I thought we had each other there. Otherwise, Griffin, what you're

48
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,000
looking at is I open first door, right? Person walks through, then they wait for me to then get

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
to the second door. It's like if they have to wait, if they have to wait, you fucked up. You

50
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,960
got to juke around them. What is this weird Cinderella's footman like idea? Excuse me.

51
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Let's get the second door for you. I'm saying that's what's expected of you when you run into

52
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,640
a 100, a surviving member of the greatest generation. If you juke around them- One of

53
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Nick Fury's howling commandos. But if they don't thank you again, fuck them forever. I don't care

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,720
if you were on the beaches of Normandy. Well, it's hard for them to thank you because they're constantly

55
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:07,520
howling. Well, I don't think that was a thing. I think it's weird to hold open both doors. I think

56
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,560
that the person would probably be so distracted by your desperate need to touch doors that they

57
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,920
wouldn't think to say thank you twice. They would be too busy thinking, what are they doing?

58
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,200
So it's a thank you and then a what the fuck? What are you doing? At what point is holding

59
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,120
the door open just become such standard courtesy that it's just like, oh no, you can only go

60
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,360
negative if you don't do it. The courtesy is to hold open the door. To me now, if I'm

61
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
like walking through a door and someone's right behind me and I don't hold it, I'm like, oh,

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm a jerk. And when I do hold it, I'm like, oh, I'm just a human being. Like I'm just a normal

63
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,400
person who didn't close a door in someone's face. It's not courtesy. It's just like basic human

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,600
nature. So I don't think I should, I don't need to be thanked for that. Like you not hating me

65
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,200
is thanks enough. My periphery's all fucked up. I basically don't have it. I'm basically a horse

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,720
with those cool horse glasses on. And I never know when a human being's behind me, which would

67
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,000
make me very vulnerable and say like a ninja scenario or just a sneaky murderer. I would just

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,120
have no idea. There could be one behind me right now. Hold on. There's not. No, not. So I almost

69
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,080
never hold the door open in the style that Travis has just described, where it's just like you walk

70
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,840
through it and maybe you give it like an extra second or two of leverage. I fucked that up a lot,

71
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,960
which my wife can attest to. Cause I just, I, she has seen me fuck that up a lot with her perfect

72
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,480
periphery. It is often a very funny moment to me though, where like I see someone go through a door

73
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,840
in front of me. They let go of the door, then see that I'm there and you watch their hand, like kind

74
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,240
of as they're like, should I, I should I grab it? No, it's too late now. Just got to keep going.

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
We could do a whole episode about door holding. Cause what's the etiquette of when you hold it

76
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
and then the person who's coming actually slows way down. Or maybe they're just much slower.

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,760
There is no, there is no worse lock of the gaze than I opening this door for you and you are too

78
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,280
far away and we both know it. And I don't know where we go from here. If you speed up, I feel bad.

79
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,480
If you slow down, then you're going to feel awkward about it. And I don't know where we go from here.

80
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Going to feel awkward about it is a nightmare. The only thing worse than that is the, um,

81
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,160
like the church letting out where you hold up in the door for one person and pretty soon,

82
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,400
like 30 people are walking through. Yeah. And you're stuck in that like, Oh, when do I let go?

83
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,480
At some point you have to just let it go and walk. Yeah. I w I would actually agree with you,

84
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,600
Travis. That is the only worst thing. I meant in a door context. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

85
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,040
Sure. Uh, this Yahoo was sent in. Wait, I have a question that I meant to ask. Oops.

86
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,720
How do they do it in Japan Griffin? How would I hold a door open? Uh, the Japanese style.

87
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Well, I'm glad that you've asked this, Justin. Um, all of the doors in Japan are hard light

88
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,560
holograms. Do you guys want to Yahoo or not? Fucking tell me, tell me now. Yeah. I am going to

89
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,760
get in the Japanese style going as my brother. We'll get some fucking hard light hologram doors

90
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,680
and stop fucking tipping. Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport, level billion Drew,

91
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,480
Drew shaman. He is a shaman of the Drew arts. Thank you. A Druid. What the fuck? How have we

92
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,840
been fucking this up this long? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Uh, Drew, it's by Yahoo answers user, just me

93
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:49,840
who asks. Okay. They land on Mars. Then what? Like, what are they going to do? Good question.

94
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,160
That is going to cross somebody's mind when they come down. Like, I never thought we'd get this

95
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,720
far. We didn't really plan. Oh fuck. Actually. Um, look guys, I found a rock. Yeah, me too.

96
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Fuck. Okay. Bring any bags or anything to put the rocks in or yeah. I mean, they're not coming back.

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
Like this is this mission. What is it? Like a hundred people like get there and they're like

98
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,440
fucking, all right, we're here. We're the first people to die on Mars. We're going to have a

99
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Martian baby. Fuck. It's super fucked up. Let's um, okay. There's nothing funnier to me. Like,

100
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,240
obviously I think like, I don't know. I'm sort of a mix of, of two minds about the whole, like

101
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,640
going to like live on Mars. Like, that's your life if you want to spend it that way. I, you know,

102
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
it's like you're going to be alone. There's going to be other people there. That's fine. It's not

103
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,360
actually going to happen by the way, but like, I think that's, that's fine. What I like is the,

104
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,280
the decision that they definitely aren't going to be able to figure out a way back. Like it is not

105
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,200
even on the list of like- That would probably be day two. Day one. We did some experiments on some

106
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,280
rocks. Day two. Should we like try and build another ship? Can we turn these rocks into fuel?

107
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,080
Because they just fucking launched House of Cards season three. And I would very much like to see

108
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,840
that before I die in 60 years. All I know is that for me, like every time I pack to like go to San

109
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,080
Francisco, you know, three hours away, I'm like, Ooh, what am I forgetting? And Teresa always

110
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,880
reminds me, don't worry. Like they have toothbrushes there. You know, they have socks there.

111
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah. Not so much with Mars. What if you land and you're like, Oh, I didn't bring socks. Socks.

112
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,680
I forgot socks. Can anyone get on the wifi yet? Oh no, you can't. Cause we're- Is it any? We fucked

113
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,360
up because we're on the fourth rock from the sun. Say you're going to Mars, huh? Yeah. How do you

114
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,720
think, how do you think the effort to make another ship there is going to go? Well, bad. Well, I don't

115
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,000
know how to make biscuits from scratch. So probably not build the rocket ship. Do they have, they don't

116
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,200
have water per se. And I've heard that's important vis-a-vis living. I thought we would just go to

117
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,440
Mars. NASA doesn't, they don't have it here. Can I, Hey guys, I'm going to Mars tomorrow for the

118
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,560
rest of my life. Can anyone recommend any good iPad games I can download for the trip that will

119
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
last me for the rest of my life? I've heard this monument Valley game is good. Will it last me for

120
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,560
the rest of my life? Well, I also might need a battery backup. What, what the phrase the rest

121
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,080
of your life means is vastly different when you're headed to a planet that does not have water on it.

122
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Cause that raises a lot more question marks about exactly how long of a span we're talking about.

123
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,840
Cause if it did fucking interstellar would have been a much shorter film and much better film.

124
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,000
I would say 20 minutes. We need to find life on another planet. There's Mars. I guess we can just

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,640
like fucking cab over there. Can we share an Uber? Okay, here we are. They also have decided that

126
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,920
like, it's also a sort of negative saying like, yeah, we're going to go die on Mars. It's kind of

127
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,840
a weird like a point of view on how you think humanity's space travel development is going to

128
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,280
go. Hey, do you think in your lifetime humanity will have a rocket that can get both to Mars and

129
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,080
back? Like that doesn't seem that crazy when you think about it. Like all you need is a ship that

130
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,640
can make the return journey. Like Justin, how many people do you think sit there and go,

131
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm going to go die on Mars. That's what they're doing. That's what they're doing. That's what

132
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,360
they're all doing, Travis. Like that is the, that is the deal. None of them have have like,

133
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,440
are even thinking about a return trip like that. This is what they're doing. Do you think they just

134
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,280
finished Breaking Bad and we're like, well, that's it. That's as good as it gets. So I'm

135
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,440
not going to get any better than that. These people are heroes. And then they're like in the

136
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,800
ship and they see a billboard as they're flying out for Better Call Saul. I would love that

137
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,520
character. I love my kids or whatever. Send me back. I think you can own these people are science

138
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,840
heroes and we're goofing on them and we shouldn't be because they're fucking science heroes.

139
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,480
And I'm fucking, I am picking up what they are putting down in a major way. But what are y'all

140
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,320
going to do up there for real though? Give me a team of like 85 year olds and shoot them up there.

141
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,520
Fucking space cowboys too. Let's go die together on Mars. Cool. I'm fine with that because you can,

142
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,720
you can squeeze fucking 15 years out of euchre. You can squeeze 15 years out of the game hearts.

143
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,000
I bring a super hard puzzle. Just bring up a billion piece puzzle and you're cool.

144
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,520
You're probably even going to have a better time up there than you would in Florida,

145
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:50,240
but like fucking, oh man, what are you doing? Like 185 year olds and one like totally tubular

146
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,280
15 year old and his skateboard. Cause the lesson gravity is going to make for some six

147
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,880
sick tricks while all the 85 year olds are like, stop skateboarding on Mars. And I want to watch

148
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,520
that movie. Cut to, cut to, uh, cut to the mom just shouting. We forgot Kevin on the spaceship

149
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,360
to Mars. He's going to Mars. Planet alone. Home alone five. He's going to do sick kickflips,

150
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:26,160
but also die on Mars. Next question. I love watching X-Files, but sometimes it's just a

151
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,560
little too freaky watching at night by myself. No one will watch it with me. And I have a vividly

152
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,840
active imagination. How do I cure my heebie-jeebies so I can watch my show without having night

153
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,440
terrors? That's from in Oklahoma. I hope I said that right. I get it. I like, I am with you. I

154
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,720
like spooky stuff, but I have to keep it in the daytime hours. Rachel and I have actually stopped

155
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
watching walking dead. Well, we should probably just stop watching walking dead period. Uh,

156
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,920
but we have stopped making it the last thing we watch before we go to bedtime. Not just because

157
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,960
it's like scary or whatever, because it isn't. Um, but it is fucking depressing. And that's my bigger

158
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,200
thing is like, if a show is going to be just sort of unswervingly dark, I fucked up last night. I

159
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,840
watched the house of cards season three, a first episode, which has some, let's call it dark material

160
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,600
in it. And fuck my, fuck my rims up, fuck my rim cycle right up. And I wish I hadn't done it. So I

161
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,200
feel you just got to set a timer on that shit. I was walking dead where it was like, we can't do

162
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,840
this the last thing before we go to sleep. And then it was, we can't watch this, you know,

163
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,640
when we're just a couple hours away from bed. And then it was, we can't watch it after six.

164
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,440
And then it just, and then it was, we can't watch it because they're not fucking doing anything on

165
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
that show anymore. They're just walking around and dying. It's a good name for the show because

166
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,400
they're just walking around and then one of them will die. They should just, why don't you just

167
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,840
like watch X-Files with your morning coffee? Like to start your day, you're going to watch a dude

168
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,440
crawl through like an air duct and dislocate his bones and eat someone's liver or whatever,

169
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
while you sip on your coffee and eat your Cheerios. Jumpstart your day with some spooks

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,840
and some scares. Jumpstart your way the scully way. X-Files. The best part of waking up

171
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:23,760
is a boneless man in your ducts eating your liver. Because for me, like what I, I would watch stupid

172
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,800
scary stuff. Like, are you afraid of the dark? And the episodes that were legit, just like goofy and

173
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,640
stupid. But then my brain would kick over to like, yo, that was stupid, but what if? And then pretty

174
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,800
soon I was up till four o'clock in the morning. Yeah. And I'm talking about like a week ago. I'm

175
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,760
a grown ass man and still my overactive imagination does that shit. So just watch in the morning and

176
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,240
then watch a bunch of SpongeBob and like wash it away. Jesus Christ, Travis. Is it, is it just,

177
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,960
is it just Nickelodeon programming for you from this point on? Listen, I have, I have a very

178
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,680
particular set of tastes and it's basically like, I only enjoy things for children. You've got,

179
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,960
you've got Jack disease, but culturally. I actually like that. Uh, I actually like that chaser idea

180
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,680
of you watch something, but then, you know, you sneak a gravity falls or something like that in

181
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,560
right after it. Someone's going to pick your spirits right up. And, uh, uh, parks and rec

182
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,800
is great for this. Antiques road show. Okay. Well, no, but sure. Oh, see, I only enjoy things for,

183
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,880
uh, five year olds or 85 year old. That's why either I'm going to watch like, um,

184
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,080
avatar, the last airbender, or I'm going to watch, uh, you know, like property brothers.

185
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,040
Travis has both Jack and Benjamin button. So some, you would think he was like right in the

186
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,840
time of his life where he met in the middle and like carried himself like a grown ass man,

187
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,320
but no, because they both reversed and turned around. And now he's got Benjamin button and Jack

188
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,000
on either side, book ending him, trapping him in a prison of his own creation.

189
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
As I worked through grad school, I nanny for a beautiful one and a half year old girl.

190
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,800
I love spending time with her and I can't complain about the money.

191
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,400
However, when I take her on the town, I'm often confused for her mother.

192
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,560
Should I try to let admirers know that she isn't my child? This has led to some awkward situations

193
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,080
like the time I responded to what a beautiful baby you have with, oh, she's not mine. I just

194
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
found her like this. Well, don't say that. Don't say that. Especially not with that inflection

195
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,960
I just unintentionally gave you. Brothers, how can I let people know that I'm a nanny and not a mom

196
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,920
without a call to the police? That's from Kidless in California. Might I suggest a broom

197
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,400
and a carpet bag and an umbrella and not a broom. Okay. Cause I forgot what Mary Poppins.

198
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,720
A witch's broom, an umbrella, some steam punk goggles.

199
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,720
Okay. I heard, I heard aerobics and I heard a Mexican restaurant. Okay. Now I need a scenario.

200
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,880
Sweating up the check. Okay, here we go. How about, hey, how about number one nanny

201
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:07,040
shirt shirt. Yeah. Some kind of branding. Can we, is this something, listen, Facebook for me

202
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,000
has become, well, a prison of my own creation. Um, so many things in your life are a prison of

203
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
your own creation. And if you take a look around, you're, you're really going to start to see the

204
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,360
bars showing, but, um, Facebook for me, that's liberation. That's the first step to liberation.

205
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,400
Remember the con is on the con is on realize you're already in a prison of your own creation.

206
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,480
90% of Facebook to me is advertisements for, uh, let's see, I got one this morning,

207
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,800
but it's like, it's an Austin thing. You wouldn't understand it. Uh, or, uh, don't worry. Leave it

208
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,680
up to Griffin McElroy. Like it's like the fucking like books that your parents would get made for

209
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,120
you. Like Griffin's a six year old space astronaut. He's going to Mars to die. Like those books that

210
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,240
Facebook has basically become that for me. Are we missing out on a nanny centric market of people

211
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,640
who are fucking, how about this nanny and proud of it? You didn't let me finish nanny and proud of it.

212
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,200
Put that shit on a shirt. If every nanny buys it, we're Brazilian airs. What about a t-shirt says

213
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,320
it's not my baby. Gotta love me. Because cultural aspect and then on the back, because I'm a nanny

214
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,000
and I love it. I'm very proud. I guess doesn't have the pride. I feel with completing a good

215
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,480
job of watching this child. That's not mine. How about front side? I'm not a booboo nanny.

216
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,560
And then on the backside, just, I'm just a regular nanny and I love it. Love it so damn much. You

217
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:46,080
can't spell awesome without au pair. You can't spell awesome pair without au pair kind of,

218
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,600
and even then not. And even then it's a stretch. You can't, you can't spell Australian pair without

219
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:59,360
au pair. There we go. Maybe. Yes. Might be a bit of a reach. Are you Australian? I think there's

220
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,920
some symbols like an umlaut or French umlaut on there. Can you change something about the baby

221
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,200
to make it clear that you two are not related? Can you make the baby a different race than you? Can

222
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,720
you reroll the baby? Can you change the baby's characteristics? Is it too late to respec this

223
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,200
baby? We just changed Drew from a shaman to a druid. So I don't think it's outside the realm

224
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,160
of possibilities that maybe your baby is now a ranger. Oh, I can tell this isn't your baby. It's

225
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,840
a tiefling. This is a tiefling baby. I understand. Justin, hold on, because we did gloss over it.

226
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:44,160
Did you just maybe suggest baby blackface? I don't think I definitely did. I think it's

227
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,600
maybe open to interpretation what you said. And perhaps my interpretation is just one of many

228
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,800
because there's a lot of beautiful races out there. Yeah. I think that, I think this is a

229
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,880
situation a lot like when people say like, Hey, how's it going? All you got to say when they're

230
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,680
like, Oh, what a beautiful little girl. Just say, thank you. I don't think you need to say like,

231
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,680
she's not mine. Oh, I don't want to mislead you. This isn't my baby. Like, okay. Yeah. Cool. Super

232
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,480
cool. Like I don't really care transaction where that information becomes important. Like you're

233
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
selling it. Like I don't think that you're selling the baby. Why are you selling the baby? That's

234
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,960
like the worst. I'll pair all pairing that you could do. That's like number one of the three

235
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:34,960
laws of pairing. Don't sell the kids. You can't harm the kid unless the kid asks you to harm it.

236
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,680
I have to reread Isaac Asimov because I've forgotten the rest. And also look out. It's Will

237
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,000
Smith. Oh, I feel like I would be. He's got a baby arm. The kid is Alan Tudyk. Do you guys think I

238
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,040
would be a good au pair? Oh, for sure. Yeah. I feel that in my heart that like that would have

239
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,120
been a good career path. If the baby just wants to chill. I think if the baby wants to, if the

240
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,240
baby wants to sketch up on a skateboard and do some truck tricks. Hey, Uncle Justin, it's time

241
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,520
to get active. I don't think so. All right. Our first activity is why don't you bring me a laptop

242
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,800
and load up to monster.com for me? Cause I'm going to need a new career path. I actually did that

243
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,920
when I babysat and the kid was like, I'm going to go outside and play basketball. I'm like, or

244
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,280
we could watch SpongeBob. What would you think about that? Huh? On the couch time, not going

245
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,880
outside for you and me. We can go on a couch adventure. Use our imaginations. We can go

246
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,760
wherever you want. Like I want to go to the park. I want to play in the creek in the park. It's like,

247
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,920
it's like around the corner. It's like in one block over, we can go to the park and just like

248
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,400
throw a frisbee around or we can go on a couch mind adventure and we could pretend that we're

249
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,080
in a park throwing frisbee, but like we could easily super do that thing and it would be like

250
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,120
super duper easy. If you love nature so much, why don't you check out the Phoenix on my computer?

251
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,960
Cause this is Phoenix online and I'm going back to college. I love that Justin's, Justin's imagining

252
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,480
of him being on a career path involves him quitting that job. So deep are those roots in Justin's

253
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,880
mind. Yeah. So deep are Justin's commitment issues to a career path. Yeah. Just completely. Yeah. I

254
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,680
can't be that. I can't find, well, how are you going to advertise that you want a less active

255
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,000
kid? Like, do you know Brayden? Do you know Brayden? Is your kid less active than Brayden?

256
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,400
Then have I got an au pair for you? Wait, are there two of you? Why did you emphasize pair?

257
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,200
It'll seem like that. That's how good I am at it. You'll wonder if there's an au pair of me.

258
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,560
That man is sitting and playing video games on his couch so good. It looks like there's two of him.

259
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,800
That guy's, that, that man is watching TV with kids and actually secretly scrolling pornography

260
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,000
on his phone. Justin. He's the worst in a lot of ways. He's super bad. Wait a minute.

261
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,520
Is there one or two of him? He sucks so much. There's only one cause he's terrible. This

262
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,040
shithead is so shitty. I'm seeing double vision. This kind of incompetence can't be contained in

263
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:29,040
one corporeal form. You'll say to yourself. I want to tell you all about BlueApron.com.

264
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Blue Apron is like one of, uh, it has literally changed my life. And I, I say that you're going

265
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,960
to sound like I'm blowing, uh, blowing smoke, but, uh, Blue Apron is a service where you sign

266

267
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,360

268
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,600
uh, send you fresh, delicious meals that are easy to make for $9.99 a meal. It's a

269
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,560
refrigerated box, uh, with, with the meat, the spices, the vegetables, everything you'll need.

270
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,240
Uh, and it's a different thing every time. The reason I say it's changed my life is they, uh,

271
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,240
there are well balanced meals. Um, and, and I, and that's always the part for me at dinnertime

272
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
is figuring out like, you know, you're tired. You don't want to put the time into like driving to

273
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,640
the store and all that stuff. So you get a pizza, you get something unhealthy with Blue Apron. It's

274
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,920
settled for you. You know what you have to do and it's all there ready for you to start, uh, digging

275
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,600
into. So it's a, like a really great, healthy option. Most meals are only 500 to 700 calories

276
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,720
per serving. We're talking about stuff like, uh, let's see, what did I have? Uh, this week I got

277
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,920
lamb shawarma. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds awesome. Oh, we did that too. Can I dip into that? Uh, last,

278
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:53,680
uh, last week I had some, uh, uh, uh, beef low main in like an orange sauce with guy land on it.

279
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,320
And I actually get a lot of vegetables in the blue apron box that I could not buy locally.

280
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,360
I mean, and that's the cool thing is not only are you getting the main dish,

281
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,920
but it also includes a side dish as well. So with the shawarma, there was a radish salad

282
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,840
and like we did, uh, we did crispy chicken thighs and like a whole separate other side dish. And

283
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,760
it was ridiculous how good it was. Like if it's so much food and it's only 9.99 per meal. So if

284
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,360
you want to try it, you're going to go to blue apron.com slash my brother, and you can get two

285
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,320
meals for free by going to blue apron.com slash my brother, that address one more time, blue

286
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,480
apron.com slash my brother. Um, here's the thing guys, when you're not eating delicious food from

287
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,760
blue apron, you're going to be wearing underwear. Sometimes those may even cross over. It's

288
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,880
impossible. No, I cook bottomless because I like to feel the air on me while I'm expressing myself

289
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,760
colonarily. And I'm saying this and I'm thinking about like grease splatter and I'm uncomfortable.

290
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,000
That's why you have to wear one of those big, like Irish thick mitt sweaters cable. So it hangs

291
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,320
down to like your knees. And that's a sexy look for a boy. Yeah. Um, I want to tell you guys about

292
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,360
the best underwear you can buy. And that is of course me undies. Uh, me undies is the most

293
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,200
comfortable underwear that exists in the world. Uh, they're dedicated to offering you, uh, comfy

294
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,640
undies that fit great. They don't ride up and they actually pull moisture away from your skin. So

295
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,240
you're cool all day long. Uh, I wore them almost exclusively down in Nolans and that swamp water

296
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,800
didn't get anywhere near my zone. Stay out of there swamp water. I have a certain barometric

297
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,240
level. I prefer to keep things down there and me undies got me. Um, they're environmentally friendly.

298
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,520
They have cool styles for both men and women. They look great. Go to me undies.com and you can look

299
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,680
at pictures of people wearing underwear and they look great. And the underwear looks great and you

300
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,560
can own them. Uh, if you go to me on these.com slash my brother, you can get 20% off your first

301
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,160
order and free shipping on that order. No kidding is the best underwear that exists. Treat, treat

302
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,080
yourself to it. Um, because you, you won't regret it. We have a message for Lydia syphilis Diller

303
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,560
Carlton. Oh Jesus. Okay. And it's from Edwin. I feel like you didn't nail the emphasis there.

304
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,080
Let me try Lydia syphilis Diller. No, no, no, no. Lydia syphilis Diller. Oh, okay. I see. There you

305
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,520
go. Uh, Carlton, uh, from Edwin double-fist Zuniga. Yeah, probably nailed it. Happy birthday to the

306
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,560
truest friend, a long haired kid from the streets of LA could have. Sorry the end of 2014 sucked,

307
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:37,440
but together we'll avoid le bonking it in 2015. Looking forward to fire pits, dice rolling,

308
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,120
pasta necklaces, judging young kids at the rock and roll shows and slapping fugazi songs on my

309
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,280
belly in the years to come. Keep it streets, LC. Wow. Sometimes I just feel like I have this open

310
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,600
wind. Like it's almost like you're driving past and you stare in people's windows and you think

311
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,840
like, I saw something I'm not meant to see. Yeah. Driving past, not like looking in for a long

312
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,760
period of time. Oh wait, hold on. Let me listen to that belly slap. Is that fugazi? Is that fugazi

313
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,160
or is that pavement? I can't. Some people will say that the only way to listen to music is on vinyl,

314
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,960
but I think the only way to listen to music is on belly slap. I actually, I like to take two

315
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,960
seven inch LPs and I use those as circular drumsticks against my belly fat. I do it against

316
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,240
other people no matter how much they ask me to stop. Got a message for Charles R. This is a

317
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:35,600
fucking name. Charles R. Mountain from Caitlin says, happy birthday, Chip. Sorry, Caitlin. Do you

318
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,480
mean Charles R. Mountain? We'll accept Chuck Mountain and also the mountain and that's it.

319
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
That's it. I know you thought your birthday present would be a personal message for the

320
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,560
McElroy brothers, but that wouldn't be a surprise at all. Instead, I got you a large frame photo of

321
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,760
Orb winning the Kentucky Derby. To redeem, mention coupon code, Orb is two steel drums.

322
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:04,960
He is. He really is. He is. Well, happy birthday, The Mountain or Charles or Chuck Mountain.

323
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,200
I don't think there's any gift that anybody could give you that's better than if your parents

324
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,600
already gave. Enjoy walking the land and spreading the good word. Mastering all you survey, Chuck

325
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Mountain. Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered. It's a show about making meaning and breaking

326
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,920
rules. We're answering important questions like, can you build a space suit in your living room?

327
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,240
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton and he has a swimming pool and I pressurized the suit and

328
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,920
sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes. The thing that I built was supporting my life.

329
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,280
That felt really good. What does it sound like when you play a polka record through a styrofoam

330
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:55,280
cup? And what happens when an airport carpet gains a cult following? Oh my goodness,

331
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,920
the carpet has an Instagram. Check out Rendered now at maximumfun.org or wherever you like to

332
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,760
listen to podcasts. Do you guys want a Yahoo? Yes. Yeah, please. This one was sent in by

333
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,920
game recognized game, Rachel Sperling. Thank you, Rachel. What was that? That was just the drum beat

334
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,400
of like when a basketball team enters. I was hoping somebody would do like the synthesizer

335
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,560
and which name name me three basketball teams. It's not the LA Lakers, the Wizards, the Bulls

336
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,080
and the Spurs. OK, someone knows their shit. This anonymous user asked this question in the

337
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:42,320
pregnancy and parenting trying to conceive category. Would your semen be able to leave the moon

338
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:51,920
if you ejaculated while standing on the moon? Oh, God, sorry, showing up on the radar,

339
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,600
it's coming hard and fast and it's not breaking up in the atmosphere. Armageddon,

340
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,640
too. We got to stop this jizz. I don't want to close my eyes, but I probably should.

341
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:11,440
I should because this sucks. Would your semen? You're on the moon. You blast off some dude juice

342
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,520
and it whoosh. I think you've created a new astral body. It would enter like it would become

343
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,000
a moon to the moon, wouldn't it? At that point, like it would enter. It would have its own orbit.

344
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,560
Yeah. Uh-huh. The tiniest comet. A little comet. It comes around every 70 years and your kids

345
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,360
look up their future telescopes and say, Dad, is that Hale-Bopp Comet 2? And you say, Yeah,

346
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,440
it is. And I have a secret I've never told anyone as much is. I guess the real question in this

347
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,240
scenario is like how what mechanism did you come up with to have your wiener out that it didn't

348
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:58,240
freeze off in the void of space? A mitten. Put a mitten over that. Of course. I don't see what's

349
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:07,600
so hard to understand about that. Whoosh. There it goes. Got you, little guy. It can fly. It'll

350
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:14,800
take trillions of years as it travels out of our solar system, goes through the interstellar black

351
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,000
hole, comes out the other end. It's trillions of light years away from our Earth as we know it.

352
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,640
And then to a derelict part of space where it's just no life has formed. And then my dew juice

353
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,440
explodes. What if that becomes the sun? Oh, my God. And that's the newest game from me, Peter

354
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:44,320
Molyneux. That is how this is the opening moments. And then from that point, you take one ounce of

355
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:53,760
the dew juice to portray, to go to every corner of the solar system. And this is the game that

356
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,080
I've made for you, Peter Molyneux. It has the most upsetting Kinect controls that you've ever-

357
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,760
You will never be more upset by Kinect controls. Graphical fidelity so rich you'll wish it wasn't.

358
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,360
And there it goes off on its own adventure. I'm just thinking about the departure.

359
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,080
Mm-hmm.

360
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:20,080
And just one astronaut watching another one. And it's like, this isn't weird. This is science.

361
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I see you've come control to me, Tom. Please stop.

362
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:31,760
And then it's like, whoosh. My own little spaceship of my own going on an interstellar journey.

363
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:41,520
And there it goes, saluted as it escapes the orbit. Whoosh. But then it runs into an

364
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,080
astronaut. And then it sticks to all the astronauts together.

365
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,560
I don't know why the scientists keep making astronauts.

366
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,200
All the astronauts get stuck together. And then it alters the orbit of this new planet you've

367
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,560
created. And it crashes into our planet. And that's Melancholia II. Lars von Trier. He's

368
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,760
mixing all of his genres together. It's a spatial sex horror romp.

369
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:15,040
And I call it Ghostbusters III. You're right, everybody. I just made it very bad. Made a bad

370
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,280
film. That's me. Lars von Trier.

371
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,600
That's right. Ghostbusters III.

372
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,680
And that's what I sound like. The classic my brother, my brother, and me bit. What does

373
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,960
Justin think people sound like? Hi, I'm Lars von Trier. This is me. Did you guys see Antichrist?

374
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,040
Pretty fucked up, huh? You may remember the way my voice sounds from the time that I tried

375
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,480
to sound like Peter Molyneux ten minutes ago. Oh, Jesus.

376
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,960
I fall asleep without trouble, only to be slowly woken up by a song, usually at about

377
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,680
four a.m. Today, it's Starship. This happens almost every night. I've tried putting on

378
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,320
ambient music or white noise, but it only makes Mbop even louder. Do you have any ideas

379
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,960
about what I can do? Save me. We built this city from this terrible. We built the city

380
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,400
on rock and roll waking nightmare. Sleepless in Portland, not Seattle. I'm confused.

381
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,040
Yeah, me too. Where's the music coming from?

382
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,640
No, I don't understand.

383
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,280
You find the source of the music and you ask them to shut it down. Like, I don't understand.

384
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,680
No, it's in your head. Or is it in your head?

385
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,200
That's the thing. What they're saying is they have a song stuck in their head. So this happened

386
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,840
to me with Bastille's Pompeii for literally three weeks, where I would be woken up from

387
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,080
a dead sleep with badadum badum in my head.

388
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
You're talking about Tarzan Boy 2.

389
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
It was so catchy.

390
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, I got Pompeii in my head really bad. I think everyone on this call will remember

391
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,800
the grim few days in February of 2015, where we were all in confined spaces for a weekend.

392
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:05,360
And I had not even the chorus of Ginuwine's Pony stuck in my head, but just the very beginning

393
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,160
sounds.

394
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,920
The opening strains.

395
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,000
The opening strains of Pony.

396
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,160
I actually looked up the lyrics later and was retroactively horrified by what I'd been...

397
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,640
So this is a great opportunity for us to talk about the lyrics of Pony in a frank and safe

398
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,200
environment.

399
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
Because this is a fun game.

400
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,720
If you're listening at home, you've certainly heard the song Pony millions and millions

401
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,440
of times.

402
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
Go ahead and say the first few words of the chorus.

403
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
They reference it on Parks and Rec.

404
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,600
He sings it at Lilith's...

405
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,040
I played it at my wedding.

406
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,760
I played it at my wedding, and I danced with my nanny to it.

407
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
But go ahead and try and figure out the first words.

408
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,600
So let's just go ahead and talk about this.

409
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,200
By the way, this is the rest of the show.

410
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,880
So if you don't want to spoil Ginuwine's Pony for yourself, then you want to skip ahead

411
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,680
to the end.

412
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,560
Here are...

413
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,120
Let's just go line by line.

414
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,520
If you have a song stuck in your head, by the way, just try and get it out.

415
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,080
Get over it.

416
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,400
Go on.

417
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,600
Okay, deuce.

418
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,560
Listen to the song.

419
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
Actually, listen to the song.

420
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,040
That's what did it for me.

421
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,560
You have to listen...

422
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,000
Because if you get halfway through something, that's when it gets stuck.

423
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
So you have to like finish it.

424
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,000
And then stop listening to it instead of midstream.

425
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,040
Because your brain gets hung up on things that are unfinished.

426
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,040
And it wants to complete the loop.

427
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
There's a lot of game design based around that.

428
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,120
Anyway, I'm just a bachelor.

429
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,760
Okay.

430
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,200
Looking for a partner.

431
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,760
Beautiful.

432
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm loving it so far.

433
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,160
This is very romantic.

434
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah.

435
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,680
So far, this is good.

436
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,960
Someone who knows how to ride without even falling off.

437
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Maybe he literally needs horseback riding.

438
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,360
Hold on.

439
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,680
Are you having a problem with people falling off of your pee pee during sex?

440
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,440
She's really bad at riding.

441
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,120
She keeps injuring herself.

442
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,560
Are you bucking down there?

443
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,280
What are you doing?

444
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,640
It's so rambunctious.

445
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
I'm very slippery.

446
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm very slippery.

447
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm not a sex time, like, master.

448
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,320
But you don't buck.

449
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
I don't buck.

450
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,760
Nobody falls.

451
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,520
Gotta be compatible.

452
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
Takes me to my limits.

453
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,080
Girl, when I break you off, I promise that you won't want to get off.

454
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,480
All right?

455
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
You're starting to confuse some of your...

456
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,680
Okay.

457
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,400
But then he...

458
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,480
Just before you can like contemplate that line, he gets...

459
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,000
Like, in case you've been somehow confused by the layers of illusion.

460
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,640
Is it horses or is it fucking?

461
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:18,960
Right.

462
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,880
Is it horses or is it fucking?

463
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Genuine dispels any of that lingering doubt by saying,

464
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,960
if you're horny, let's do it.

465
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,920
Ride it, my pony.

466
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,520
But he could be being very obtuse there.

467
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,280
And he could be just speaking politically if you're super horny to ride a horse.

468
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
I mean, because that's me.

469
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Like, basically every day I'm super horny to ride a horse.

470
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,440
Give me more general parlance, not the specific, not the literal horny,

471
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,760
but the new vernacular horny.

472
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,840
Like, I'm really horny to try this burger.

473
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,720
Yeah, I'm horny.

474
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,160
I don't want to fuck this burger.

475
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,480
Right.

476
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
No one would want to fuck a burger.

477
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,520
But I will.

478
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,640
I will if you need me to.

479
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,520
If I have to.

480
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
If it's going to get me this job, yeah, sure.

481
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,080
Listen, I'm going to be devil's advocate here because-

482
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,000
That's what it's going to take to sell you this car.

483
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,440
I'm going to be devil's advocate here because I feel like people have over-sexed this song

484
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,160
way too much, and I am still unconvinced it's not about horsies.

485
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,120
What a pretty fun interpretation of this song is that Genuine has never had sex in his life

486
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,640
and doesn't know the things that happen in it.

487
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,760
So he imagines that maybe falling off is a problem,

488
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,200
or maybe someone gets broken off at a certain point.

489
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
Or like if it's not compatible because like yours is kind of shaped like this

490
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,920
and hers is kind of shaped like that.

491
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,960
It's like, well, I'm not going to fit in there.

492
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,560
Some people have a duck penis.

493
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,520
I don't know.

494
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,840
What do you say before you do it?

495
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,720
Probably something like really direct, like if you're horny, let's do it.

496
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,360
Do you think that's how people have sex together?

497
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,320
Like they say that?

498
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,160
I can't think of literally any other introduction to the act.

499
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,400
Yeah.

500
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,480
Then I'm going to kiss your butt.

501
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,920
You're going to kiss my butt?

502
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,760
Because that's-

503
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,400
Is that what you-

504
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
Gonna pinch your elbows now.

505
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't think, and then he thinks saddles are involved.

506
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,120
My saddle's waiting.

507
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,560
Come and jump on it.

508
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,760
Now here's where I think my theory is reinforced.

509
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,360
In the next section of Genuine's Pony,

510
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,600
he has completely exhausted any like imagined sexual prowess that he has

511
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,720
and says the lines,

512
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,880
sitting here flossing,

513
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,400
peeping your stelo.

514
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
He's sitting here flossing.

515
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah.

516
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,000
He knows about oral hygiene.

517
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
He's got a fucking amazing smile.

518
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,280
So I'm not so surprised about that.

519
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,520
Peeping your steelix.

520
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,360
He's looking over their Pokemon collection.

521
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,520
So like, yes, again, I'm on board.

522
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,640
Is it possible he's so deep into Pony play that when he says like,

523
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,680
you're falling off and like my saddle is ready, he's being literal.

524
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,960
Like if you want to do this, put a saddle on me, ride me around the apartment.

525
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,720
Do a horsey back ride.

526
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,120
And then nine months later, you'll poop a baby out of your butt.

527
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,840
I think.

528
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,080
Yeah.

529
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,680
Maybe.

530
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,840
There's some more vague,

531
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,960
vague allusions to the sex act,

532
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,960
culminating in chills up and down your spine,

533
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,120
juices flowing down your thigh,

534
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,880
which I think we can all agree.

535
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,720
It's sweat from the saddle.

536
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,400
I got the sweaty thighs from this saddle.

537
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,760
I need a bigger saddle that it has that it breathes.

538
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,920
So here is the next, the last section of this song.

539
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,040
And he starts,

540
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,160
he grabs the reins of this fucking crazy metaphor

541
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,560
and just steers it into a shopping mall.

542
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,760
And it's just like knocking over trash cans.

543
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,120
Cannot keep it on the rails.

544
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,480
Here are the last lines of the song.

545
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,680
If we're going to get nasty, baby, first we'll show and tell.

546
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:57,920
Okay.

547
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,040
So metaphorically, what you've done is you've taken us into a classroom

548
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,240
where we're going to show and tell about the things

549
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,200
that we're about to do.

550
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,320
And what are those things?

551
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,400
Show our genitals and tell about them?

552
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,360
Tell about our genitals.

553
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,400
This is my penis.

554
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,840
His name is Steve.

555
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,800
This is penis.

556
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,320
What is this?

557
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:17,760
Tell me.

558
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,120
What do you call this?

559
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,040
Till I reach your ponytail.

560
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,280
Okay.

561
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,480
So now you've like conflated ponytails with ponytails

562
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,680
and maybe another,

563
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,160
and there's definitely like an animalia layer.

564
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,080
He might actually mean like a ponytail butt plug

565
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,280
from Extreme Restraints.

566
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,800
Or he thinks that he's going to go so deep in that vagina,

567
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,720
he's going to reach her butt again,

568
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,520
proving that I don't think he understands what's up down there.

569
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,800
Is that Genuine's hand coming out from underneath your ponytail?

570
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
Like that one scene in The Grudge?

571
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,920
Yes, it is.

572
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,040
He's deep inside.

573
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,560
He then says, lurk all over and through you, baby.

574
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,440
He's going to go on a magic school bus adventure

575
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,560
through your vagina tube until he takes the butt exit.

576
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,720
He's going to lurk.

577
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,240
But he says he'll lurk.

578
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,080
How are you going to lurk through someone?

579
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,960
What's wrong?

580
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,520
What's wrong?

581
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,040
You seem distressed.

582
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
Yeah, my stomach is really hurting.

583
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,280
It might be I had some Mediterranean food

584
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,800
and I don't usually handle that well,

585
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,400
or possibly Genuine's on a magic school bus adventure inside.

586
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,320
And he's lurking around my insides.

587
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,280
Lurking around all over and through me.

588
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,640
And then he gets that,

589
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,240
like he tries to bring the metaphor back around.

590
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,720
He says, until I reach your stream,

591
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,800
you'll be on my jockey team.

592
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,280
Sure.

593
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,680
What are you even saying?

594
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,240
Like I don't even understand metaphorically

595
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,640
what you're trying to get across anymore.

596
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,480
The stream is a metaphor for the fact

597
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
that he can lead her to his penis,

598
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,920
but can't make her drink.

599
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,400
And then the jockey team,

600
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,360
she's going to be on the team of people riding him.

601
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,560
Apparently?

602
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,840
For competition.

603
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,800
He is not making her feel special.

604
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,120
Maybe he says jockey team

605
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,400
because he feels like he had to rhyme with stream.

606
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,480
But honestly, Genuine, that's a restriction.

607
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,160
That's a self-made prison, man.

608
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,440
Yeah, look around.

609
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,040
That's a prison you made for yourself.

610
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,200
Stream didn't make any sense in context.

611
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,520
You've had no water-related-

612
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,680
Again, Genuine, you did say earlier

613
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,080
that she was the one with a ponytail.

614
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,840
And if that's the case, she's a pony

615
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,360
and ponies don't ride other fucking ponies on races and shit.

616
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,400
How about this line?

617
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,640
I don't want you to think I'm a player.

618
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm going to make you my only mare.

619
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,400
That's beautiful.

620
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,880
That's fine.

621
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,960
But then you have just confessed

622
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,360
that you have a team of people

623
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,600
that are unsuccessfully riding on you

624
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,440
because you won't stop fucking bucking them off.

625
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,000
You have to have some backups

626
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,680
because that's how he thinks sex works.

627
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,440
Well, what he's saying is

628
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,400
she's going to have to work his way up the jockey team

629
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,160
because you don't just start the jockey off

630
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,560
in first position.

631
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,480
You get in on the ground floor.

632
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,080
Yeah, I'm going to welcome you to the line

633
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,840
and if you can prove that you're better

634
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,160
than Jimmy and Steve and Susan and little Jimmy,

635
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,640
then you can be the head of the jockey team.

636
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,840
But until then, if you're horny, let's do it.

637
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,480
You got to muck my stable, if you know what I mean.

638
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,360
If you know what I'm saying.

639
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,520
I wish he threw out more metaphor.

640
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,920
Oh, there's so many things that he could do.

641
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,040
I'll let you shoo me.

642
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,000
What?

643
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah.

644
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,240
What does that mean?

645
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,360
Inspectum, my teeth girl, looking for gum health.

646
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,760
It'll be there because I floss awesome.

647
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,920
An apple, two apples, third apple, I'll eat them.

648
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,400
I'm pulling your carriage.

649
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,160
I pooped on the street and the Shriners rode through it.

650
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,920
He's in a parade in this metaphor.

651
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,760
Sure, I'm with you.

652
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,040
Wow, that really was the rest of the show.

653
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
I told you, I knew, I sensed it.

654
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,800
I sensed it coming.

655
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,040

Who's the other one, Griffin?

661
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,320
The other one is Blue Apron.

662
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,080
Blue Apron, you can go there and you can get delicious

00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,120
ingredients to cook your own delicious meals at home.

664

Also, Max Fun Drive is coming up.

668
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,560
It starts on the 16th and goes for two weeks.

669
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,720
I mean, this will be our fourth, I think,

670
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
but if you're new to the show or new to the network,

671
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,520
Max Fun Drive is our opportunity to give you something

672
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,120
like the best shows of the year.

673
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,720
And it's also your chance to become a sponsor,

674
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,880
a donor of My Brother, My Brother and Me

675
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,600
and other great maximum fun.org podcasts.

676
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,000
And you'll get some great gifts for becoming a donor

677
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,600
or upgrading your donation.

678
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,160
You also get bonus episodes and I can only speak for

679
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,840
My Brother, My Brother and Me in the Adventure Zone,

680
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,120
but they're fucking good.

681
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,320
You won't want to miss those.

682
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,560
So, I mean, I don't know.

683
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,080
I wasn't sitting in on the Sawbones

684
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,520
or the Bunker Buddies bonus episodes.

685
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,080
I don't know what kind of heat you guys are bringing.

686
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,000
The Bunker Buddies one was super fun.

687
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,520
How was Sawbones?

688
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,920
I haven't done it, but will.

689
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,560
It's gonna be good.

690
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,600
It'll be real good.

691
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,320
It's gonna be great.

692
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,920
Also, I'm gonna let you know,

693
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,200
there's a couple more tickets left.

694
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,120
I think there's only a few for Milwaukee

695
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,400
and a little bit more for Chicago,

696
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,360
but they're going really, really quickly for our live show.

697
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,920
So go to, it's bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Chicago.

698
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,120
And the other one is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-M-I-L.

699
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

700
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,080
for the use of our theme song,

701
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,120
It's a Departure off the album,

702
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,480
Putting the Days to Bed.

703
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,280
A terrific album.

704
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,960
I was actually listening to it this morning

705
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,480
because it got a little chilly here in Austin.

706
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,000
It's a nice cold weather buddy,

707
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,920
but it's also a warm weather buddy.

708
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,440
It's completely arbitrary what type of weather it is.

709
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,880
Just buy the album and listen to it.

710
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,440
It's great.

711
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,800
I also want to say we got a, or I did at least,

712
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,360
from Rob Toner in the LA PO Box.

713
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,400
Rob sent me two Mordecai posters.

714
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,200
Oh God.

715
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,480
And they're the gigantic ones,

716
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,120
the one of Johnny Depp and the one of Gwyneth Paltrow.

717
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,800
Oh sure, yes, I know them well.

718
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,960
Oh, they're so wonderful.

719
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
I'm going to put them up in my home.

720
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,640
The PO Box for the LA, the West Coast,

721
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,240
is PO Box 341769, Los Angeles, California 90034.

722
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
Speaking of, super quick,

723
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,920
I want to just blow through these

724
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,600
because I want to thank people

725
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,400
for the great things they got us for Candlelightz.

726
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,240
And I've had this stack of stuff next to my desk

727
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
for literally three months.

728
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,960
And so just let me say it.

729
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,560
Andy sent me discs of all the Joystick podcasts.

730
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,000
Thank you so much, Andy.

731
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,880
Oz and Ben sent us a beautiful greeting card.

732
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,280
We got one from Lead Beaters here.

733
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,880
We got pickles from Scottsdale.

734
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,040
Got a game of horse sense from Reed,

735
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,320
a t-shirt and CD.

736
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,560
Kate and Carl sticker factory.

737
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,960
And Sean sleeps naked is the name of that CD.

738
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,520
Andy got me Power Factory on CD.

739
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,040
We got a beautiful postcard from Nauter Sessions.

740
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,080
Scientists, those words don't make any sense.

741
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,440
A postcard from Eric in California from Rome,

742
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,480
which is beautiful.

743
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:39,120
A postcard from Dennis R. from San Francisco.

744
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,160
That's beautiful.

745
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,720
A lovely Christmas card from Brian and Katherina.

746
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,680
Another one from the Hills, which is just lovely.

747
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,360
Everybody's got beautiful families.

748
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,120
The Vandenbrooks sent us one.

749
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,560
They have a beautiful family.

750
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,560
I'm happy to report.

751
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
Oh, I was worried.

752
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,120
I know.

753
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,560
Thank you, Brian, for the lovely note

754
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,560
and the Adventure Zone gifts.

755
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,120
Thank you to George Zimmerman for the very kind note.

756
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,440
And congratulations to Talon Wisdom for graduating college.

757
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,600
Thank you, Lindsay, for the beautiful gift

758
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,920
that you sent to us.

759
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,480
Jennifer and Laura, thank you for the wedding invite.

760
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,800
Thank you to Nikita for the Jimmy Buffett book.

761
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,160
Thank you to Save the Date from Rachel and Chris.

762
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,520
That's very kind of you.

763
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,720
We've got a beautiful postcard from India.

764
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,880
Thanks to Anne for that.

765
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,320
And finally, lastly, a dice bag from Trevor Dearborn

766
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,480
that he fashioned for us himself.

767
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,560
These chain link dice bags, I'll have to get you guys.

768
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,360
Oh, sweet, yeah.

769
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,680
So I know that was, sorry, everybody,

770
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,440
but thank you to everyone who sent us stuff

771
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,520
because it really is so very kind of you.

772
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,960
Yeah, thank you all very much.

773
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,120
Got a final Yahoo answer here from level 9,000.

774
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,800
Yajuridru at Drew Davenport.

775
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,560
Thank you, Drew.

776
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,320
This is by a suspended Yahoo Answers user who asks,

777
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,960
where and how can I get a life like Kesha's?

778
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,240
I want a life like that.

779
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,200
I'm Justin McElroy.

780
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,320
I'm Charles McElroy.

781
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

782
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,960
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

783
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,520
Kiss your dad.

784
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,080
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kiss Your Dad, school.

785
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,880
Way on the lips.

786
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,080
Maximumfun.org.

787
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,120
Comedy and culture.

788
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,240
Artist-owned.

789
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,280
Listener-supported.

790
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh, hey there, everybody.

791
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,720
I'm Guy Branum, and welcome to Pop Rocket,

792
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,960
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture

793
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,640
we all love to love.

794
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,800
With me to talk TV, film, music,

795
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,320
and anything else entertaining

796
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,160
are journalist Margaret Wappler,

797
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,960
academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

798
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,320
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell,

799
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,560
and comedian Santina Muha.

800
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,880
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

801
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,080
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

802
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,440
No name-calling, no rudeness,

803
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,040
just straight talk and a lot of role play.

804
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,720
I'm only 30-something for another year.

805
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,600
Me too.

806
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,080
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

807
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:52,960
Pop Rocket comes out every week from Maximumfun.org.
