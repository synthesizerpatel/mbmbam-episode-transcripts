1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,340
And their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,320
Oh, Travis insists, Balcony, that he's a sexpert.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,260
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,160
Also, this show isn't for kids,

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,660
which I mention only so you babies out there

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,700
know how cool you are for listening.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,200
What's up, you cool baby?

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,340
One, two, three, four.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,100
It's the start of something beautiful.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,040
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,520
It's ripened into a precious friendship.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,680
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,520
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,500
My life, it feels like life.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Ah, it's better, it's better with you.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,980
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:16,480
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with two.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,960
My life, ah, it's better with you.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,300
Hello, San Diego, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,560
and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,900
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:43,780
And I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,980
Thank you for making it louder than his.

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:56,320
And I'm the phantom of the Balboa.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,860
That is part of the deal at Performing at the Balboa.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,760
You do have to let the phantom join the show.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,940
And you have to bring your own phantom, which is like-

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
So they had to-

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Times are tough.

31
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Times are tough.

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,480
They had to kill me.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Had to.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
They made me a ghost, contractually.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,800
The hardest part was coming up with your unfinished business because you've done so much.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,620
Right now, my unfinished business is finding out what is sharp on dad's hat that stabbed

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,280
me in the fucking ear when I came out here.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Oh, that's the Gom Jabbar.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Oh no!

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Oh no!

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Gom Jabbar!

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Griffin, no!

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Oh, sorry, this is Comic-Con.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
We have to explain.

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,440
The Gom Jabbar-

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
You see-

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
In the documentary-

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
He is the mind killer.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,920
He is the mind killer of Moon.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,560
This is Griffin's third night wearing a tuxedo.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
And-

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Well-

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
And-

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
And?

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
And last.

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,680
It continues to evolve.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,320
The cape without the coat is new tonight.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,440
I do hope you and Sailor Moon finally work things out.

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,480
I would love that.

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,280
Oh, sorry, okay.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Tuxedo mask is a character-

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Here's the thing that is click-through that I didn't realize, Griffin putting on a tuxedo

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
makes him-

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,240
And he's already a fairly uncomfortable human being day-to-day.

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,440
Him putting it on, he begins to move like Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black, where he's

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,600
like, is this how I can't-

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm loving it.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And Griffin's next-year theme is about pajamas.

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
It makes me feel so pretty.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,720
I felt like a sexier era of Vincent D'Onofrio, where he was like a cool, smooth-

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
How do you choose?

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,000
Wait, when was that era?

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
Was he in Full Metal Jacket?

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
He was in Full Metal Jacket.

75
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Just because-

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
And Full Metal Alchemist.

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
The sequel.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Not a lot of people talk about how those two things are related.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,920
Travis, just because we changed the theme does not mean you cannot continue to dress

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,040
like the rich villain from a dystopian YA novel.

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Thank you.

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,800
You can continue to rock that style.

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
His name's Alabaster Hawk.

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Governor of the 13th-

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,680
Everything you guys are describing rules.

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
Yeah, actually, it sounds pretty good.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I would love that.

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,400
We should have done that instead.

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
It's not too late.

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,900
We're heading towards a dystopian future faster than you think.

93
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,480
And Travis would be a steady hand on the rudder.

94
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
This is what I'm saying.

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
Could do worse?

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Could do worse?

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Could do worse.

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Could do better.

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Could do much better.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm not gonna lie.

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Could do much better.

102
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,440
This is an advice show.

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
You know what I would like to see?

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,200
You've made me think about this now, Justin.

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,260
A dystopian novel, right?

106
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,840
But what we're in the middle of is a presidency in this dystopia where it's like, yeah, he's

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
not the best.

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
He's not the worst.

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
He's not great.

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
It's okay.

111
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
We've had worse, but we've also had better dystopian presidents.

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,080
This is not the setup for a longer, more political bit that Travis is workshopping.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,880
Do not sweat it.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,140
This is an advice show, and we have reemerged here in San Diego, like our friends, the Chilean

115
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,400
miners did long before us.

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,880
We have long been in hibernation here underneath the Balboa, waiting for our moment, biding

117
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
our time.

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
To strike!

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Will people cheer that line?

120
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Are they, I should ask you, are you cheering the callback or the tremendous effort that

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,280
went into saving the ladder?

122
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
That's it?

123
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Y'all just still can't believe how well that all works out?

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,760
Holy shit.

125
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Are you kidding me?

126
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
They all made it, I think.

127
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
This is what I'm saying.

128
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,400
There's a sliding doors universe in which we're not referencing it.

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
No.

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
But in our comedy podcast, how many of them would have had to not make it out for Justin

131
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,680
to not use that, do you think?

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,240
Because if, I mean, a quarter of them don't make it, still pretty good.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,200
Still not bad.

134
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,940
I think baby Jessica messed up the percentages because the 100% of baby Jessica made it out

135
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,440
of the well, right?

136
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Yeah.

137
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
Was that right, sincere?

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Because I don't remember.

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Yeah, 100% of baby Jessica made it out of the well.

140
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay.

141
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,820
Comic Con.

142
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,000
Baby Jessica was, okay.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,880
That actually might be necessary.

144
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
Anybody under the age of 32, we probably shouldn't be saying that.

145
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,820
Imagine a world before Twitter when a child fell down a well and the entire fucking country

146
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,600
lost its mind and cared in a non-joking way.

147
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
Everyone glued to the TV, we've got to get this kid out of the well and we did.

148
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,920
That was the last time things worked out.

149
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,440
And originally she didn't, so I do want to say a huge thank you to Dr. Sam Beckett for

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,320
quantum leaping back and saving baby Jessica.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh, sorry.

152
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
We should explain.

153
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
So Dr. Sam Beckett.

154
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Quantum left.

155
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,200
That was a short episode where he leapt in and he was like, am I crawling toward that

156
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,760
fucking well?

157
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,520
No, thanks.

158
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
This is an advice show.

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Did they spend a lot of time during that with baby Jessica like, does anyone have thinner

160
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
arms?

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Thinner, but longer.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Todd has thin arms, Jim has long arms.

163
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
We need someone in between.

164
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
How far down was she?

165
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
This?

166
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Look it up, Paul.

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
This is an advice show.

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
Could I have gotten her?

169
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,080
I got long arms, Paul.

170
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,760
Travis, I for sure think you've got, you definitely could have got.

171
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,720
I think our stretching technology, our understanding of the human physiology has advanced so far

172
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
in the last 30 years.

173
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
You know who could have gotten her?

174
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
I have a baby Jessica report for you guys.

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Yeah?

176
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
22 feet.

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Okay.

178
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,320
So just, just out of my reach.

179
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Yeah.

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Okay.

181
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Now I'm like, how did she make it out?

182
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Cause who has 22 foot arms?

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
That's a good question.

184
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Was that like a claw game kind of thing?

185
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,640
Cause I'm pretty good at that too.

186
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,080
And thank you, Inspector Gadget for making time in your day to save baby Jessica.

187
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Inspector Gadget was, French Stewart is, okay.

188
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,000
This is an advice show.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
A lot of people are going to say Broderick.

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
This is an advice show.

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Yes, it is.

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,260
And we take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

193
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,960
And now we're going to do that.

194
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay.

195
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I promise.

196
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,360
You are fun.

197
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I miss this.

198
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Okay.

199
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm planning on.

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Are you talking about us?

201
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
No.

202
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Demonstrably.

203
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
No.

204
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm planning on going skydiving for the first time and I need.

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Don't.

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,280
I need to know what are some topics of conversation I can talk to the skydiving instructor about

207
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,160
while I'm strapped to them gently floating for five to seven minutes.

208
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,920
That is from Caitlin.

209
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
Caitlin, are you here?

210
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Hi.

211
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Hi.

212
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Oh, hi Caitlin.

213
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay.

214
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
What I love.

215
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,000
Sitting awfully low, Caitlin, not in the, not in the high up seats I see.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,520
The laughter and reaction I heard from most of the audience.

217
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,280
I believe you shared a similar feeling I did when I first read the question where I thought

218
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,040
that's not something I've ever thought about.

219
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,720
And now it will be what I think about every time I think about tandem skydiving.

220
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah.

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Because there is a certain point where it's like you get out of the plane, you're falling

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
for a while.

223
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
You're like, oh, whoa.

224
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
There's not a-

225
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,000
It's still, it's still, whoa, ground's still pretty far away, huh?

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Do you-

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,920
It's like a little soon, kind of creepy how soon you pulled it actually, freak.

228
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,160
I actually want that.

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,760
If I ever tandem skydive with someone, I don't want them being like, I got more time, I'll

230
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
pull it later.

231
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
Pull it now.

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,240
I want it pulled as we're jumping out the door.

233
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Yeah.

234
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:16,640
I, I think it's interesting that you have prioritized fears and it is one, jumping out

235
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,280
of plane, much higher than that, what to talk to a person while jumping out of plane about.

236
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,400
Well, to be fair, jumping out of plane is a, like, you're either in plane or not, right?

237
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,840
But talking, that can fizzle out a couple of times-

238
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
There's so many of them.

239
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,960
Gravity only goes one ways, but conversational discomfort is a wide spectrum.

240
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,520
Because oh my God, what you don't want to do is say something to upset the person.

241
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,040
What if you say like, oh, you watch the football game?

242
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah, let's hear it from Marshall.

243
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
And they're like, I hate Marshall.

244
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
And you're like, oh, please don't let me die.

245
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,640
And they will kill you by dropping you to your death.

246
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
Then they flip over so you're on the bottom and they land.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I assume.

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've never done that.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what?

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,120
I actually think that the onus is absolutely on the person that you're jumping out of the

251
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,680
plane with.

252
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,520
Because for you, you're jumping out of a fucking plane.

253
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,400
For them, it's Tuesday, right?

254
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
Like that let them come up with some small talk.

255
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,960
You're losing your fucking mind thinking, why did I do this?

256
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm so squishy.

257
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
This is ridiculous.

258
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I've got so many bones.

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,400
Also, the chances are you've either passed out or peed yourself, which are both great

260
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,420
conversation starters when you're strapped to another human being.

261
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,460
How long was I out?

262
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,800
And sorry, it's warmer.

263
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,640
Do you think it's hard for the instructor to find a balance between like-

264
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,540
You don't want to seem scared, because that's weird.

265
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,160
But it's got to be every time, yeah?

266
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Every time your body's got to be like, oh, Doug, god damn it.

267
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Again?

268
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Fuck.

269
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Okay.

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Fine.

271
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
But you also can't be so laid back.

272
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Right.

273
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,640
Because the other person is having the experience of like, what are we doing?

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,720
And if you're like, what did I have for dinner last night?

275
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Yeah, you can't-

276
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
You're like, what?

277
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
You got to be 100% dialed in.

278
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
That's supposed to be a hard line to walk.

279
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,080
I also think the question has to be, because when you're doing a tandem dive, I assume

280
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,960
you're connected in a pretty per- like, not permit.

281
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
At the butt.

282
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
But like-

283
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
What?

284
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
At the butt.

285
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
They connect you at the butt.

286
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Butt to butt?

287
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Butt to butt.

288
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,240
And the parachute just comes out from between you.

289
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,200
Yeah, butt to butt.

290
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,340
But there has to be a moment when you land, and if you don't time the separation well,

291
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
you land.

292
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Whoa, that's awesome.

293
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
So.

294
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,340
You're going to unclip us?

295
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,520
Or am I supposed to unclip?

296
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Or-

297
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm un-clipping five feet off the ground.

298
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm un-clipping-

299
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,480
Justin's doing a halo jump from-

300
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,640
Wait, no, we're still- I'm just ready.

301
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,040
How many of these do we really need?

302
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,520
I have a second parachute in my pocket, and I'm base jumping off you.

303
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,720
If we spoon on the ground, it's cheating.

304
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,080
Also, because chances are, the person I'm strapped to has heard me say some things in

305
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
this one.

306
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Right?

307
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,200
I've done some pretty desperate prayers.

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,640
I've cursed myself and them.

309
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Why would you let me do this?

310
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
You're making us heavier!

311
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,280
I have kids, you monster!

312
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,120
Is definitely a thing that's coming out of my mouth.

313
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,560
The idea that we'd land and high-five and go get a beer together is out of this world.

314
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,760
They've heard me make some deathbed confessions.

315
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,640
They might have to die, actually.

316
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,840
Let's be real, Caitlin, you're worried about the wrong time period, because when you're

317
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,500
falling through sky, anything goes.

318
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,440
They're barely going to hear you.

319
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,920
Well, after the flight, you will be in a van.

320
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,880
You'll be in a van driving back to your car, and you're going to have to think of eight

321
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,520
different ways to say, fuck the sky, right?

322
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Jesus.

323
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,760
Do you remember when we were... Yes, I remember.

324
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,040
As I've said, I was there.

325
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Do you remember, though?

326
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
We fell out of a fucking plane.

327
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Yes.

328
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,600
The chance that you will come up with an observation about the experience that this tandem diver

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,600
has not heard before, that's the real... What am I going to say when I land?

330
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
Oh, it smelled funny.

331
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
That might be good.

332
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
That could be offensive.

333
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
That could go bad.

334
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,080
It could also just be ozone.

335
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Hope that helps.

336
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,600
While eating at Fazoli's, my girlfriend will scan our receipt to reap the loyalty points.

337
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
She will then-

338
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
They do loyalty points at Fazoli's?

339
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Yeah, they got to keep you coming back.

340
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,320
She will then go from table to table asking strangers for their receipt.

341
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,760
That wasn't enough of you reacting that way.

342
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,440
They insist it's all right since their points would go wasted.

343
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,160
I think it's rude to interrupt a stranger's meal.

344
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,320
For reference, points are $1 equals one point and 75 get a free spaghetti.

345
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
$75.

346
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
No, wait, hold on.

347
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,620
Are you thinking that's a lot?

348
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,040
Because my thing is one point for $1 isn't enough.

349
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,840
You got to jack that out 100 points for... And it's 7,500 points for spaghetti, whatever.

350
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Well, you invest at one and then the market-

351
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
But one point-

352
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
I know.

353
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,560
That doesn't feel like a lot.

354
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
She currently has 140.

355
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,800
That's a lot of Fazoli's you've either consumed or stolen your fellow customers.

356
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't think-

357
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm going to use the word reapsed.

358
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Yeah, sure.

359
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
You've reapsed that many points.

360
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Harvested.

361
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Yes.

362
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Recycled.

363
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
Loyalty points are weird if you think about it.

364
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Yeah, wait.

365
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah, go to the comedy microphone, Justin.

366
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,480
Okay, yeah.

367
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Okay, so this is just how my mind works, but-

368
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Skewed view.

369
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Skewed view.

370
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah, I want to give you my twisted skewed view.

371
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Thanks.

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Careful, folks.

373
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
He works blue.

374
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Travis, you don't talk when he's doing it.

375
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Shut up.

376
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Okay, here I go.

377
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I was talking to him to shut up.

378
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You're heckling now.

379
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
You're heckling.

380
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Okay.

381
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm going to check my phone.

382
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
So I go to Subway.

383
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
They gave me this card.

384
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,480
If I get 10 subs, they'll give me a free one.

385
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:03,920
But if I like the subs and I want to eat one and I'm giving you money for it, that should

386
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
be enough.

387
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
No, don't.

388
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
That should be enough.

389
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Oh, no.

390
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,960
This has become a dramatic one-man show.

391
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Because it should be enough that if I go to-

392
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
He's crying.

393
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,860
If I go to-

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,000
If I go to-

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,080
Listen how his accent is changing.

396
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
He's trying to...

397
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
No, listen.

398
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
He's trying to supplicate himself before-

399
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,880
I'm saying you should just want to go to Subway because you want to eat fresh.

400
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Yeah.

401
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,760
And you shouldn't need to punch a card to feel good about it.

402
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Yeah.

403
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Yeah, man.

404
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,600
For sure.

405
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Now sing Bring Him Home and the audition will be over.

406
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,960
I will say that the discomfort that is introduced by having to say the sentence, may I have

407
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,840
your Fizzoli's points, is as such that I would much rather go table to table and say, may

408
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:04,440
I have $1 that I may then one day spend on fettuccine.

409
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,560
I think that if it is uncomfortable, it is not because of the idea of click the points.

410
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,320
You just got to work on your patter, right?

411
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,720
Because if you go from like, hey, who here likes table magic?

412
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,800
You guys like table magic?

413
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm going to make those points disappear.

414
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Right?

415
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Something like that.

416
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
And they're like, I think this is part of it.

417
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,160
I mean, I've never seen a table magician in Fizzoli's before, but they are wearing a cape

418
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
and a vest.

419
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,700
So I'm defending my PhD dissertation in oceanography at the end of next month.

420
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,000
This live show is my early celebration.

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,680
My school has a tradition where students sign their names in the rafters of one of the campus

422
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,880
buildings when they successfully defend.

423
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,120
I always thought I would think of something cool for this, but now it's a month out and

424
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,640
I got nothing.

425
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,600
As three famos who sign your names often, what's the coolest signature?

426
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:06,040
I study, I shit you not, whale and dolphin sounds.

427
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,880
If that helps.

428
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,280
That's from soon to be PhD in SD.

429
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Are you here?

430
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,720
Wait, how many of you are there?

431
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
There's a lot of you defending your whale.

432
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Was that echolocation?

433
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,600
When you say it's a school tradition, is it sanctioned or is it like, we did it, give

434
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
the ladder.

435
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
What?

436
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
You kids?

437
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Ah.

438
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
You did it again.

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,520
If I may.

440
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
You may.

441
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Okay.

442
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,680
It feels a little presumptuous that you're like, what's the dope shit I can say when

443
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,240
I definitely defend my dissertation?

444
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,320
No, no, I'm not saying you're going to fail, but I am saying you're putting the cart a

445
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
little before the horse.

446
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,400
This is a time that you're never going to think about whales and dolphins again after

447
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
you finish this.

448
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Right.

449
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Right.

450
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
This is your last time having to think about it.

451
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
Just power through and think about them for one more month and then you're out.

452
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You came to this show early.

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're planning your ticket.

454
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We do appreciate you buying a ticket.

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you so much.

456
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But you shouldn't have come.

457
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You should have just bought the ticket.

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

459
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,680
You came to the show to celebrate.

460
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,640
Your signature is soon to be PhD.

461
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,600
You're planning on what your signature is going to be.

462
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,440
That's three pre-celebrations.

463
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,320
You should drill down, think about dolphins and the sounds they make.

464
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
For once.

465
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,980
Because you don't know, you might be out at the beach and do whatever it is you do to

466
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,680
summon the whales and dolphins to the shore.

467
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,600
Don't get them too close though because then we have to all band together to push them

468
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
back in.

469
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Yeah.

470
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
And that's a lot of work.

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,720
It's unpaid work.

472
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
It's not great.

473
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,640
And what if I accidentally push you hard and fall through the whale?

474
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Embarrassing.

475
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
It's super embarrassing.

476
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,760
Why aren't you super busy drawing off microphones?

477
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,480
I would think that's like such a big part of your day.

478
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,640
I'm just saying a whale might make a noise you've never heard before and you'd be like,

479
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
start over.

480
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,640
When you defend your PhD, is it like a bunch of people in fancy wigs saying like, that's

481
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,400
not what a whale sounds like.

482
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
I've heard a whale.

483
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,760
I bought a CD once at Borders.

484
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,120
And you're like, no, that is actually what whales sound like.

485
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
I don't know.

486
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,200
If you haven't practiced making whale sounds with your mouth, you should because that will

487
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,720
definitely be part of the defense.

488
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Without looking.

489
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,120
No, I'm hiding the sheet music.

490
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Just do it.

491
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,520
I think it went something like, nope.

492
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,800
Can you sign in a way where like the Y at the end of your name becomes like a whale?

493
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,120
Oh, that's good.

494
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
That's good, right?

495
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,280
You might make one of those bumper sticker Jesus fish.

496
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
Yeah.

497
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
There's a high Icthus probability.

498
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
Could you sign it in dolphin?

499
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Where it says like E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E.

500
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,600
Listen, this is all insulting, but it's all we know about you.

501
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
That's true.

502
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm sure you got a lot of other cool shit going on.

503
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
You didn't include that in the question.

504
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,400
The next best thing I have is like, I had a whale of a good time here at school.

505
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
That's fucking funny.

506
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
That's fucking funny though.

507
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,600
If you do, if you're the first one to get there, it's yours.

508
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,320
Future aliens will be like, Gribbler, get over here and check this out.

509
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
This is fucking hysterical.

510
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,360
It is important that you then do put a little note of like, I got my PhD in whale, for context

511
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,200
aliens, I got my PhD in whale sounds.

512
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You get it.

513
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:54,880
Last Christmas, I received a $25 gift card to Red Lobster, but no one will go with me.

514
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:03,240
My friends and family laugh when I suggest going to the restaurant.

515
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Is it sad?

516
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,600
Now read the question.

517
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,920
That old thing?

518
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,280
I dusted it out from my rejected by weird owl pile.

519
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,720
I get it on that one, honestly, Albert.

520
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,420
No, this is a question.

521
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,480
Is it sad to go by myself and chow down on the four course seafood feast for $14.99?

522
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,080
Can I take an unsuspecting date there?

523
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Is it bad to use a $25 Red Lobster gift card on a first date?

524
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,640
I've never been to Red Lobster before and I love lobster.

525
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,160
That's from Lobsterless in Los Angeles.

526
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,440
I've never been to Outback Steakhouse, but I love Australian culture.

527
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,400
I've never been to McDonald's, but I love Irish culture.

528
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,440
When you say an unsuspecting date, how unsuspecting?

529
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,800
Is that like, surprise?

530
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,760
Take the blindfold off.

531
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,600
The blindfold is actually a bib.

532
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
We're at Red Lobster.

533
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,400
I can tell you, the only thing I think would be sad about eating by yourself there is if

534
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,640
you didn't use the whole gift card in one meal.

535
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Oh boy.

536
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,840
If you said like, okay, so that's what, $14.99, that's $10.01 left.

537
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
I'll be back tomorrow.

538
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,120
Nah, it's no good, yeah, coconut shrimp, top it on there, $25 even.

539
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,720
You gotta get it even though.

540
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Gotta get it even.

541
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,400
Because if you go over and you're like, and here's a nickel, you've lost.

542
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,160
Don't waste your time going there.

543
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Are you here?

544
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Yeah.

545
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Hi.

546
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,080
You know you could be at Red Lobster, right?

547
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Right now, or any of the other fine Darden family brands, the gift card will work at

548
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
any Darden restaurant.

549
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
There's no way.

550
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,480
Yeah, you could be used to the Olive Garden.

551
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
That's too much power.

552
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
No, no, no.

553
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Most of the Darden are interchangeable.

554
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,760
You should read the fine print.

555
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,720
So don't waste it.

556
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,680
You gotta wait until the vortex opens up and it's Endless Shrimp Fest.

557
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Yep.

558
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,280
Because Shrimp Fest, you are going to extend the value of this gift card in a way where

559
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,720
you won't want other people there.

560
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Yeah.

561
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,240
And if I may, Justin, you won't want other people to witness.

562
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
This is what I'm saying, right?

563
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Yeah.

564
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
Most of the time, you can't find a guest to join you.

565
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
This time, you can't find a witness.

566
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Yeah.

567
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,760
And you're not gonna want that.

568
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,800
Because let me tell you from experience, it's more impressive to tell someone you ate 102

569
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,440
shrimp after the fact.

570
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Right.

571
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,320
But if you're keeping the count as it's going in front of another human person, it's not

572
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
fun.

573
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,080
It's a fun story, but a bad act.

574
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Yeah.

575
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Right.

576
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,360
And there is definitely like culpability, if I can say that.

577
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,760
If you watch someone eat 102 shrimp and you don't try to do something.

578
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,840
And they're like writing it on the back of a napkin with a pencil so they can keep track

579
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
to know exactly how many there are.

580
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,200
This is getting deeply, deeply specific.

581
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Well, maybe you're there with your older brother and his like newborn daughter.

582
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,040
And maybe it's the first time you've ever taken your newborn daughter to a restaurant

583
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,280
and you want to make her proud with how much shrimp you can eat.

584
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,480
And there's a certain amount of, what begins as unspoken competition and then becomes very

585
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,320
much spoken competition to see how many shrimp your human body can consume.

586
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,360
Don't waste time.

587
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,920
By the way, sometimes they're gonna try to give you shrimp with like rice.

588
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Oh, no.

589
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,400
That's a fucking sucker's bet.

590
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,840
It's not Rice Fist.

591
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
No.

592
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Pasta, rice, potatoes.

593
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Sucker's game.

594
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Yeah.

595
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Those are fillers.

596
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,560
They're gonna be like, are you sure you wouldn't want some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits?

597
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Absolutely.

598
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
No.

599
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I don't want more Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

600
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
But you can put those in a to-go box.

601
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I'll take those home with me.

602
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Yeah.

603
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
I'll take those with me.

604
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
They don't reheat well, but they are free.

605
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Don't ask for...

606
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,920
Do you guys remember that time you paid $40 to watch two adult men tell a great red lobster

607
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
eating story that they did one time?

608
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I'm just saying.

609
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,960
Don't cut the legs out from underneath me.

610
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,520
If you ever go for Shrimp Fest, one last piece of advice, you're gonna want to alternate

611
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,360
breaded, saucy, breaded, saucy.

612
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,400
Don't do all saucy.

613
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Too much flavor.

614
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't do all breaded.

615
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Too filling.

616
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Breaded, saucy.

617
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,460
Too much flavor is a common problem at Red Lobster.

618
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,800
This is just too zesty.

619
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,380
I can't handle it.

620
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,600
And don't pace yourself.

621
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
Regret it later, not in the moment.

622
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
That's what I always say.

623
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,080
Do you know that they make you pick your lobster out of a tank?

624
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
You know that, right?

625
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,960
They tell you its life story about all its children and friends.

626
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,640
Red Lobster's a great restaurant.

627
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Hey, for your oceanology defense, you should just go burn down a Red Lobster.

628
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,320
I defended the hell.

629
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
This land is defended.

630
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,480
Hey, guys.

631
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Yeah.

632
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Yeah.

633
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,880
I think it's time to do some minion quotes.

634
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,320
Okay.

635
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,880
Now there is nothing.

636
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,080
Here's what I want to say.

637
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,520
There's nothing more delightful than this bit and when I am not the one doing it.

638
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,640
What a treat that is.

639
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,740
So before we get to the first one, finding minion quotes is a surprisingly difficult

640
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,720
task because of trying to find the right search terms, right?

641
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,160
And so what I tend to do is I find one and I'm like, this is great.

642
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,320
And then I just go through like the related images search.

643
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,720
And I hit my new favorite version of minion quotes.

644
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,560
Can we see the first quote, please?

645
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Quote number one.

646
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Wait, can you explain how the bit works?

647
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,680
Travis, can you explain the rules of the game?

648
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Yes.

649
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,720
Justin and Griffin are going to try to guess the cartoon character represented here in

650
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,100
this hilarious meme.

651
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,960
And if they get it right, I will post it to my Facebook.

652
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
It's Garfield.

653
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Hmm.

654
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,160
Now, Justin, will you read this hilarious caption I found?

655
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,460
Happy Tuesday.

656
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
It's got to be Garfield.

657
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,480
He made it through Monday.

658
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
He's excited about Tuesday.

659
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
It's got to be Garfield, Griffin.

660
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
It's not fucking Garfield.

661
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,560
It's too easy.

662
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,280
The artists who create these, Justin, possess minds capable of a type of lateral thinking

663
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,240
that you and I can only aspire to.

664
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
I think...

665
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Odie.

666
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,960
No, you can't change it.

667
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm going to say Bart Simpson.

668
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Okay, reveal.

669
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Shit.

670
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,520
It's Yogi Bear, my dude, stoned out of his mind.

671
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Yogi Bear?

672
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,520
With his, I'm just seeing now, far too large collar.

673
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Yeah.

674
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Okay, fine.

675
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Whatever.

676
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Next image.

677
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,800
God, it makes me so mad when I fucking don't get them on this game.

678
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
It should have been Garfield.

679
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Garfield.

680
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Reveal.

681
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:04,640
Now, this one says, it's only Tuesday, exclamation point, question mark, exclamation point, question

682
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
mark.

683
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Okay.

684
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,920
And how has the cartoon character been removed here?

685
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,480
Paul has done some Photoshop magic.

686
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Okay.

687
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,560
I feel, and this may just be a color palette thing, like Fred Flintstone.

688
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Ooh.

689
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,920
See, when Travis responds with anything other than fuck, I know it's not right.

690
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,960
Now, I'm trying to keep my game face on.

691
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Taz.

692
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Like Adventure Zone?

693
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
Tweety Bird.

694
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,560
Okay, reveal.

695
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
You were close, Justin.

696
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,880
Oh, that's got to fucking sting, dude.

697
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,680
It was Woodstock.

698
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,980
Woodstock can't talk.

699
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,040
It's Tweety Bird.

700
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
That's a badly drawn Tweety Bird.

701
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
That is not.

702
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
That is not a badly drawn Tweety Bird.

703
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
It's a bad Tweety Bird.

704
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
How dare you say that about Charles Charles.

705
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Take the L. It's a bad Tweety Bird.

706
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Our third and final...

707
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,960
Now, this one says, good morning.

708
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Happy Tuesday.

709
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Okay.

710
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,160
I found so many about Tuesday.

711
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,240
You guys are lucky I limited it to three.

712
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,720
I had six.

713
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Fine.

714
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Fine.

715
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Fine.

716
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
I'm going to...

717
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,880
This is not my guess, but if I wanted to go down a pretty deep well, I would say, what

718
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,680
if that's not an M, that the shape is obscuring, and it is in fact the Noid, and those are

719
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
its fucking ears.

720
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Now, I will say, I had one that contained an M&M, and Paul told me that you guys would

721
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
say that was cheating.

722
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,440
So, I have not included any mascots in that way.

723
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Okay.

724
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Thank you.

725
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,920
That was a gift you've given me, because now I know definitively...

726
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Now I don't.

727
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Fuck.

728
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Can we have a hint?

729
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Because it's no fun.

730
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
No.

731
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,240
It's no fun if we don't get any of them.

732
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,120
Travis, you have to give us a hint, because we have to get at least one of them.

733
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Come on.

734
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,360
The energy ending act one on a win is so much better.

735
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Okay.

736
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Okay.

737
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Okay.

738
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Okay.

739
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Okay.

740
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
Okay.

741
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Okay.

742
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
And not a bullshit hint.

743
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Just tell us the answer.

744
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,520
Tell us the answer so we can embarrass you.

745
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,200
There's so little context for these, Travis.

746
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Justin?

747
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Griffin?

748
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah.

749
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Follow your heart.

750
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
That's fucking...

751
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Garfield.

752
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Fuck.

753
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Yeah.

754
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,200
It is so fucking hard.

755
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:33,320
We'll be back in just a minute for some more comedy jokes.

756
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Send us your questions.

757
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
We love you.

758
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
We'll be right back.

759
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
It's better.

760
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,320
It's better with you.

761
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,520
Griffin, I'm so stressed out.

762
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
We had to cancel these shows.

763
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
I'm freaking.

764
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,760
I can't imagine why, bro.

765
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,320
It's pretty chill out there.

766
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
No, it sucks.

767
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,960
I mean, it's like, I'm freaking out.

768
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,480
We had to cancel these shows, and my brother has COVID, he'll be fine, but I'm like freaking

769
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
out.

770
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Yeah.

771
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,800
And it's so stressful, and I just wish I had a way to calm down.

772
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Yeah.

773
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:14,480
I mean, that's fucking funny, because we have a sponsor this week, and the name of the business

774
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
is Calm.

775
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,840
I use Calm nearly every night to help myself fall asleep.

776
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,560
They have meditations that you can do, which are great.

777
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:31,440
They also have these sleep stories that are amazing, and they're intentionally dull.

778
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,120
There's one, by the way, where Peppa Pig's dad tells you about concrete for a half hour.

779
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
It is fantastic.

780
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Sign me up.

781
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Yeah.

782
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Fantastic.

783
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Absolutely fantastic.

784
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
You can rest.

785
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
You can recharge.

786
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
They have stories for kids and adults.

787
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,480
There's even daily movement sessions, which can help relax your body and uplift your mind.

788
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,380
If you go to calm.com slash my brother, you'll get a special offer of 40% off of a Calm premium

00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
That's calm.com slash my brother.

795
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,000
I have recently moved to the District of Columbia and had to go get a new driver's license from

796
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
there.

797
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,460
The day I walked in, handed over my paperwork confidently, they were like, time to take

798
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,800
a photo.

799
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,840
I was like, this is an important moment because it's going to be my representation in photological

800
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
form forever.

801
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:49,600
I looked down and I was just stitch fix H to T. I was like, I'm ready.

802
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm ready for my fashion to be captured.

803
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
They took the picture.

804
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,080
They're like, this looks so good, we're going to put it in the Library of Congress just

805
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
down the street.

806
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,440
Where'd you get those duds, man?

807
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
I was like, stitch fix.

808
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
How's it work, Griffin?

809
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,520
Well, at the Library of Congress, oh, stitch fix, it's so stinking easy.

810
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,640
You just go through this questionnaire and they ask you where you get your clothes from,

811
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,040
what you like to wear, what your price range is, how big everything is, and then they will

812
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,880
send you a box with some stuff handpicked just for you.

813
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Clothes, right?

814
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Clothes, yeah.

815
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,040
Hey, we found a bunch of paper clips in our office, do you need these?

816
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,240
Check it out.

817
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
It's tastations.

818
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,840
We just have these lying around.

819
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,200
No, you try on the stuff, you check the fit.

820
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,480
If you like it, you keep it, you buy it, and if something doesn't fit, you don't vibe with

821
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,640
it, you send it right back for free.

822
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,440
There's no problem at all.

823
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,760
It is incredible.

824
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,560
We've all been using Stitch Fix for forever, and I'm excited because I've got this, I've

825
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,240
got a lot of sort of fall and winter wear from Stitch Fix that I didn't, it never really

826
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,000
was in the rotation for very long in Texas, but now, oh, baby.

827
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,040
It's sweater weather, and it's all Stitch Fix from here on out.

828
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Right now, Stitch Fix is offering our listeners $20 off their first fix at stitchfix.com slash

829
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,500
my brother, that's stitchfix.com slash my brother for $20 off today, stitchfix.com slash

830
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,800
my brother.

831
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,920
Thank you so much for listening to our episode for this week.

832
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,640
This is a lot of fun.

833
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,960
I wish we, you all could have been there in one big room.

834
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
I wish Travis could have been here.

835
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,680
I wish Travis could have been here, and I wish you could have been there, but you can

836
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,640
bring the magic home, which is something I want to start saying more.

837
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Oh, that's fine.

838
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,840
The magic home with our merchandise, we've got some new stuff, a Garrel blanket designed

839
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,580
by Lynn Doyle, at Lynn Doyle underscore on Instagram.

840
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:59,040
We got Canonites wrapping paper designed by Justin Gray, who is at Burn to Build on Twitter.

841
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,780
10% of all merch proceeds this month will go to the Fair Elections Center, which uses

842
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,500
litigation and advocacy to remove barriers to registration voting, particularly those

843
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,820
disenfranchising underrepresented and marginalized communities, and to improve election administration.

844
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,620
If you want any of that, you can get it at McElroyMerch.com.

845
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:23,840
We have some shows coming up in Washington, DC, Detroit, and Cincinnati for my Bim Bam

846
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,760
and Taz, and also San Jose and Denver.

847
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,640
We will be figuring out new dates for the shows that we had to reschedule, I guess last

848
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,280
week when you hear this, very, very soon.

849
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,620
All that info and tickets and everything are available at bit.ly slash McElroy Tours.

850
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,420
Get all those shows, masks, and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID tests within

851
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,340
72 hours of event start will be required.

852
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,740
And hey, would you do us a huge favor and pre-order the Taz 11th Hour Graphic Novel?

853
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,520
It comes out February 21st of next year, and pre-orders are very important.

854
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,580
If you didn't know that already about books, I didn't until we started making them, and

855
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,440
it's pretty important, and also the book is good, and I think you'll feel good reading

856
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
it.

857
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,940
Go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com right now to pre-order it.

858
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,860
Check it out, have fun, and that's it.

859
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
That's all of them.

860
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:29,600
We'll be back with a new dead episode, I guess, next week, and prayers up for Trav, he's doing

861
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
much better.

862
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,620
But this freaking-

863
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I'm done, man.

864
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm over it.

865
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:41,660
I'm done, because Joe told me and everyone we whipped this thing.

866
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,380
Yeah, it's impossible that Trav has got it.

867
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
What is his angle?

868
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
It's weird that he got it.

869
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,140
And Justin, let me tell you, I think he did it to try to embarrass the American president,

870
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Joe Biden.

871
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
That's so rude.

872
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,020
He'd be like, oh yeah, it's over, is it?

873
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,780
And Joe's like, oh, damn it.

874
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:04,500
Joe's like, it's not cool to have COVID anymore, and Trav's like, I'm sorry, sorry, Joe.

875
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,020
Anyway, that's all the ads for this week.

876
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,540
Let's get back to the show.

877
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,360
Hello, dreamers.

878
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,340
This is Evelyn Denton, CEO of the only world-class, fully immersive theme resort, Steeplechase.

879
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,220
You know, I've been seeing more and more reports on the blogs that our beloved park simply

880
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,540
isn't safe anymore.

881
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,780
Murdered them?

882
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,060
I'm gonna wreck it.

883
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,900
They say they got mugged by brigands in the fantasy kingdom of Ephemera or hijacked by

884
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,340
space pirates in Infinitum.

885
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,940
I mean, I could have a knife.

886
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,260
My papa said that I needed to do a crime.

887
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,660
Friends, I'm here to reassure you that it's all part of the show.

888
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,420
These criminals were really just overzealous staff trying to make things a little more

889
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
magical for our guests.

890
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,820
We're just as safe as we've always been.

891
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,020
This isn't a county fair, dreamers.

892
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:58,860
This is Steeplechase, the Adventure Zone, every Thursday at MaximumFun.org.

893
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,580
Since the dawn of time, man has dreamed of bringing life back from the dead.

894
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,340
From Orpheus and Eurydice to Frankenstein's monster, resurrection has long been merely

895
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,140
the stuff of myth, fiction, and fairytale.

896
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
Until now.

897
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,500
Actually, we still can't bring people back from the dead.

898
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,380
That would be crazy, but the Dead Pilot Society podcast has found a way to resurrect great

899
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,980
dead comedy pilots from Hollywood's finest writers.

900
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,880
Every month, Dead Pilot Society brings you a reading of a comedy pilot that was sold

901
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,220
and developed but never produced, performed by the funniest actors from film and television.

902
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,860
How does Dead Pilot Society achieve this miracle?

903
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:44,500
The answer can only be found at MaximumFun.org.

904
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,220
I realized moments before we came up here that I have spilled red wine on this rented

905
00:39:51,220 --> 00:40:00,980
tuxedo shirt, which I'm pretty sure is, like, the one thing they ask you not to do.

906
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,100
This is also where I go to in this moment.

907
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,980
There's no way you're the first person to spill red wine on a rented tuxedo.

908
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,420
They're like, throw it in the vat.

909
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:16,860
I may be the first person to charge that to his family business credit card.

910
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:23,900
I recently got a job working at a train museum.

911
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,900
When my next door neighbor found out about the job, he told me he had some items he thought

912
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,980
the museum might be interested in.

913
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,780
Not how that process works at all.

914
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,380
I was skeptical, but I asked my boss if they'd be interested in receiving some items from

915
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,380
him.

916
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,920
She seemed kind of annoyed and said he could email them pictures, but the museum is too

917
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,660
full of artifacts already.

918
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:50,020
Okay, wait, real quick, that feels like there were some words edited out in the middle.

919
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,140
They were pretty annoyed, but said yes.

920
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,980
Yeah, wait, they're not looking to add anything.

921
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,780
I told this to my neighbor, but despite this information, he made me take pictures of an

922
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:07,760
old mug with a train on it and told me to show my boss.

923
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,980
Now every time I see him, he asks me if I've shown her the pictures.

924
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,940
Brothers, how do I get out of this awkward situation without annoying my boss, and that's

925
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,020
from Train Lady.

926
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,580
I also like that nowhere in there do they say how the boss responded after showing them

927
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,180
the picture of the mug, but we can all assume.

928
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Yeah, we know.

929
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,660
Like the rest of that story wasn't like, oh fuck, check out that mug, yeah.

930
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:40,460
I want to quibble with something before we're helpful, and maybe this lets you off the hook.

931
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:50,140
Um, I take umbrage with the train museum boss, who's like, what do they have?

932
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Old train shit?

933
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:58,420
Like, do you have the dopest old train shit already, and you know it?

934
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,900
The fact that you're closed off the possibility.

935
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:08,980
Secondly, if people who run old train museums can't get excited about old train shit, what

936
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,180
are we even doing?

937
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:18,300
Like you should be the one person who's like, no, you don't get it, it's a mug with a train

938
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
on it.

939
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,140
It's amazing.

940
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,980
What we've got, Justin, is a classic scenario.

941
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,020
When they started the museum, oh god, they were so passionate about trains.

942
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,980
They cared so much they had a fire burning inside, but now years have passed, and the

943
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,380
world has crushed that fire out, and now you, the young gun Train Lady, have a chance to

944
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:44,320
come in and reignite that fire with your passion for this busted ass mug.

945
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,900
Did anybody else imagine it as a museum where everything's tiny like model train size?

946
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,100
Okay, so that wasn't just me.

947
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,980
That's not a museum though, right?

948
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,860
You can't be a museum to that one thing a guy builds.

949
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,340
If you don't- That's just Rod Stewart's attic.

950
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,780
Rod Stewart's way into model trains, by the way.

951
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,260
Hey, this is Comic-Con, they know that Rod Stewart's way into model trains.

952
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,220
He's blown a lot of his money on model trains.

953
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:17,900
It's just labyrinth quotes and Rod Stewart trivia with this crowd.

954
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,220
Train magic, okay.

955
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:29,860
I mean, I think you should say like we have it, we're putting it in a, you know in real

956
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,540
museums they don't exhibit everything all the time.

957
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,420
Sorry, real museums?

958
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Sorry.

959
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,980
I didn't mean that.

960
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,140
Okay, no, you know what?

961
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Fuck off.

962
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:47,020
Real museums aren't like, real museums aren't like, paintings?

963
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
Got enough.

964
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,020
No, hold on.

965
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,020
Hard pass.

966
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,020
To be fair.

967
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
Wait, that's a triceratops.

968
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
What?

969
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,020
No.

970
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
Thank you.

971
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,780
If everybody who worked at the Louvre came in and said, my neighbor has a painting, do

972
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
you want it?

973
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,580
The Louvre wouldn't be like, hell yeah, we do, the more the merrier.

974
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:12,260
Well and more specifically, no one comes into the Louvre saying, my neighbor has some drinkware

975
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,740
with a painting on.

976
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,500
Oh, you guys like the Mona Lisa?

977
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Well, I have a blacklight poster of the Mona Lisa, do you want that too?

978
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,700
You know the Mona Lisa?

979
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,900
What if you could sip a Bev out of her head?

980
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:30,220
Now I've got you interested.

981
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,780
Yeah, I think just take it, leave it at the museum.

982
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,300
Any time he comes by, put it out.

983
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,600
Just like he was an in-law or something, it's fine.

984
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,660
This is going in the private vintage.

985
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,580
They actually, they would have displayed it, but it's too valuable.

986
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,180
They can't afford the insurance.

987
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,660
It's too erotic.

988
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,740
This is going in our erotic section.

989
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
You must be 21 years old.

990
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,740
Through this beaded curtain.

991
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:10,140
It's a haunted doll watch.

992
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,780
When you listen to this recording later, you'll be like, wow, that was really smooth how they

993
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,940
transitioned from one thing, because none of that will be in there.

994
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,900
Let's meet Mary.

995
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,340
Oh, oh, with a track by Ludacris.

996
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:32,340
They got orb on this track?

997
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,160
Paranormal to regular doll.

998
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Don't freak out.

999
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,580
Paranormal metaphysical doll vessel.

1000
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,700
Touched orbs, free spirit reading, free gift.

1001
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,660
Touched orbs sounds like something that you say when you're in high school and are trying

1002
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,020
not to sound like you are a virgin.

1003
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Yeah.

1004
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,020
Oh, me?

1005
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,380
I for sure touched the orbs.

1006
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,740
It applies to so much.

1007
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,500
I guess you could say thine orbs have been touched.

1008
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:07,180
And yeah, I got a free gift, wink.

1009
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:14,340
It got metaphysical, paranormal, metaphysical doll vessel, touched orbs, free spirit reading,

1010
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
free gift.

1011
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,260
Greatly powered, my friends.

1012
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,060
Her name is Mary.

1013
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,820
It's like she's carrying a Derringer.

1014
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,180
She is positively touched and charged.

1015
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,100
She will be out tonight for the supermoon charging.

1016
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,300
Did you know that if your haunted dolls are running a little low, you can take them out

1017
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:44,780
during a supermoon and charge them up full of that good spirit juice that they crave.

1018
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,540
Their personal card readings have been drawn during listing with Mary's help.

1019
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,180
Listen to that called shot.

1020
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:58,220
I did a reading for the person that will buy this with the help of my assistant, a doll.

1021
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,540
Who you are buying.

1022
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,540
Who you will buy.

1023
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,660
Wait, but during the listing, was it during every other word?

1024
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,460
When did they stop and do the...

1025
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,820
A special prayer and intention has been sent out for Mary's new owner.

1026
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:17,100
So that's like...

1027
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,260
She just hit select all on her phone and just uploaded everything.

1028
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,580
I mean, to be fair, that's a top notch cat.

1029
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,900
That's a great cat.

1030
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,180
Cat has buoyed the power of the show.

1031
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:35,820
I'm saying like a special prayer and intention has been sent for Mary's new owner.

1032
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,880
Mary, this is, listen, Mary comes, cause I will not repeat it unless you ask me to.

1033
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,100
Mary comes with a gorgeous bracelet.

1034
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,440
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

1035
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,660
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

1036
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,340
I do not see a stamp mark in it.

1037
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,160
Mary comes with a gorgeous bracelet.

1038
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,220
What is that image though?

1039
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,620
So it's basically the seller saying like, don't try to take this on the Antiques Road

1040
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Show.

1041
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,440
There's no stamp mark in that bracelet.

1042
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,140
The bracelet gets lost and found often.

1043
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,140
That sounds fucking annoying.

1044
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
I don't want to buy that.

1045
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,260
Look at that.

1046
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,340
Mary attracts orbs and spirits.

1047
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,260
Take photos of her when you request communication to the lost.

1048
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Fucking wow.

1049
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,340
Okay so they got out, went out for the supermoon charging.

1050
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,900
Person took a break from writing this listing to go out and do the charging and then return

1051
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,340
to the listing.

1052
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,460
Take another break to do a reading.

1053
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,460
Right.

1054
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,460
I revised listing to show orb manifestation during supermoon.

1055
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,460
Double.

1056
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
Yeah.

1057
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,460
Okay.

1058
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Real quick.

1059
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:51,100
Paul, let's go ahead and enhance the orb, the orb manifestation that I'll remind you

1060
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,820
the cops can just look at.

1061
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,820
No problem.

1062
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,820
Orb manifest.

1063
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,820
No, no.

1064
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,820
Zoom in on the, okay.

1065
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,820
Yeah.

1066
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,940
They should have clicked the featured image that has the fucking orb in it.

1067
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,940
That's a Hyundai Sonata.

1068
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,940
Right there.

1069
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,200
That's not two orbs.

1070
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,740
That is a Ford Taurus.

1071
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,740
Nice try.

1072
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:26,740
A day ghost.

1073
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,240
Okay.

1074
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,320
Email with questions.

1075
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Are you sure?

1076
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,420
Because I got a few paragraphs worth over on this end.

1077
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,020
Lucky numbers included free.

1078
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,540
Talking with her tonight sent Coco nuts.

1079
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,100
Oh, that's a cat?

1080
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,100
That's the cat.

1081
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,000
Look at that cat going wild.

1082
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Do you take that to mean that she was talking to the doll and it made her cat wild or that

1083
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,940
her cat was talking to the doll and it just drove rape shit?

1084
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,380
Justin, if I could real quick, you pretend to talk to the doll and I'll be the cat.

1085
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,380
Okay.

1086
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,380
That's how I think it went.

1087
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:16,180
Would you like a treasure from the, oh.

1088
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,460
Talking with her tonight sent Coco nuts.

1089
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:25,740
So you can buy that, nope, maybe it's sold out, but you can.

1090
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,780
It went for no bids.

1091
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,780
No one bid on it.

1092
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,780
All right.

1093
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,780
I don't know why.

1094
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,340
It sent Coco nuts.

1095
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:41,780
We asked you our beloved audience members for your queries, if I may be so bold.

1096
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Let's begin.

1097
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Hello.

1098
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
Hello.

1099
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,780
I'm Annie.

1100
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,780
Hi, Annie.

1101
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,780
My pronouns are she, her.

1102
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Hi, Annie.

1103
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
Thank you.

1104
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,940
My question was how do I avoid seeing naked people at work?

1105
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,940
Yeah.

1106
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,940
And you know what?

1107
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,940
Can I tell you, Annie?

1108
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,940
Yeah.

1109
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,060
I hope your job is like, I work at McDonald's.

1110
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,060
What context?

1111
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,180
So I work in retail.

1112
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,180
Yowzy.

1113
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,140
Oh, it's a fitting room thing, right?

1114
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,140
Yes, it is.

1115
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,140
Thank God.

1116
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:17,180
And I'm just, you know, doing my thing, helping her out, finding her sizes, and I come back

1117
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:24,460
with her item that she asked for, and the door swings open, you know, butt ass naked,

1118
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,300
all right?

1119
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
That's all you need to know.

1120
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,300
You said that in a way that was so butt ass naked to me.

1121
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,580
You get it, right?

1122
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,820
I was alarmed, to say the least, but I had to remain calm.

1123
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,420
We don't do that.

1124
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
I don't do that.

1125
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,420
No.

1126
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,420
Not there.

1127
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,980
In fact, sometimes when I'm trying to close on in a story, if I hear other people talking,

1128
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,060
it breaks the spell.

1129
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,860
I'm just reminded of like, oh no, I share this space with other human beings.

1130
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,860
I hate this.

1131
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,940
Well, and the bigger issue, Annie, is that underpants are the secret pants we wear underneath.

1132
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,140
Oh, that's an excellent point.

1133
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,140
Underpants.

1134
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,580
What kind of stuff do you sell?

1135
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:10,540
Underpants are the secret pants we wear underneath, so that that exact scenario doesn't happen.

1136
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,700
I know that I have at least that.

1137
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,580
If all else fails me, clothes wise, I know I have the secret pants that I wear under

1138
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,580
my big pants.

1139
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,580
Yes.

1140
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:25,300
If a big spill happens, a big hot spill, and burning is an issue, or a bug gets up there,

1141
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,940
I have options.

1142
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,220
I have smaller pants underneath my larger.

1143
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:38,020
That I keep underneath that are humiliating, but not illegal.

1144
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,340
Yeah.

1145
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,460
Humiliating for one, not both, which is what nudity is.

1146
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,020
Can we all agree?

1147
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,020
Anytime someone is-

1148
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,500
We should all be deeply ashamed of our bodies.

1149
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,140
Thank you, Travis.

1150
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,940
It's gross what's going on down there invariably.

1151
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,420
What even is that?

1152
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,420
No one knows.

1153
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,940
No one knows or understands it.

1154
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,940
Anything?

1155
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,780
No, it seems like you not.

1156
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,260
They open and they're like, check it out.

1157
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,660
Look at my emperor's new clothes.

1158
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,820
Was their behavior as such that you assumed that they assumed this was an everyday thing

1159
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,820
for you?

1160
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Yeah.

1161
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,820
That you would become so-

1162
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,820
Immunized.

1163
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,820
Immunized.

1164
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,820
Okay.

1165
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,980
So inured to the nude form that you would just be like, oh, whatever.

1166
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,220
That's what you have going on?

1167
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,740
Seen it.

1168
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,660
Are they an older person?

1169
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,660
Yes.

1170
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,660
Okay.

1171
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,660
This is my gut.

1172
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:39,740
In the 40s, they didn't have Twitter, so they just got naked all the time.

1173
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:44,460
I do think that there is, as time passes, you're like, I don't have time for modesty.

1174
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,660
Is the feeling of like, oh no, that's bad actually.

1175
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,780
We should all have time for modesty.

1176
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,220
That should be, but I find myself feeling that way more and more.

1177
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,220
Hey, did they say ta-da?

1178
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,220
No.

1179
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,220
Thank God.

1180
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,220
Good.

1181
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,700
Good, good.

1182
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,460
That's a relief, honestly.

1183
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
Thank you.

1184
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,340
I think in that circumstance, you're fully justified to go, no.

1185
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,340
No.

1186
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Please.

1187
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
You have to leave.

1188
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,820
This babies are us.

1189
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:16,100
I insist that you see your way out.

1190
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,020
You're trying on a starter jacket.

1191
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,020
What's wrong with you?

1192
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,020
What's wrong with you?

1193
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,700
You don't Winnie the Pooh a starter jacket.

1194
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,340
You wear pants.

1195
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,780
Does that help?

1196
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,780
Very much.

1197
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Thank you.

1198
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Oh good.

1199
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,780
What a relief.

1200
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,780
Hi.

1201
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,780
Hi.

1202
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,780
Hi.

1203
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,780
Hello.

1204
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,780
My name is Eric.

1205
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,780
I go any pronouns.

1206
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
It's a great dress.

1207
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,780
Thank you very much.

1208
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,780
It was $7 at a thrift store.

1209
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,780
Damn.

1210
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
Wow.

1211
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
Wait, hold on.

1212
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,780
Are you from the Midwest?

1213
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,780
Because that's a Midwest reaction.

1214
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
This, $5.

1215
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:55,940
I got to say, Eric, it's a come up in the words of my friend Macklemore, our relative

1216
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,940
Macklemore.

1217
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,940
Yeah.

1218
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
Why didn't he change his name?

1219
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,940
Why didn't he change his name?

1220
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,940
Eric, what's up?

1221
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
How can we help?

1222
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
What's your question?

1223
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,940
So, I got into D&D from the Adventure Zone a few years ago.

1224
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
Nerd.

1225
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,940
Yesterday.

1226
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,940
Yeah.

1227
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,940
Get him.

1228
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
Oh, okay.

1229
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
Wait real quick.

1230
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,940
D&D stands for Dungeons.

1231
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,940
All right.

1232
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,940
All right.

1233
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,940
All right.

1234
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,940
Sorry.

1235
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,500
Actually, it's Dungeons, not Dragons.

1236
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Okay.

1237
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Go ahead.

1238
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,620
And I made a bunch of dork ass friends.

1239
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:30,940
And being the only handy person I know, they went, hey, can you make us some swords?

1240
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,940
Okay.

1241
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,900
And you responded, yes.

1242
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,900
Of course.

1243
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,900
Sure.

1244
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,900
Of course.

1245
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,560
What was your skill set before this moment?

1246
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Making one sword.

1247
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
Okay.

1248
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,560
Yeah, I assumed, Eric.

1249
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Okay.

1250
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,220
I have run into this exact problem.

1251
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,100
I do things with wood one time, and I've done that now.

1252
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,780
I don't ever want to do it again.

1253
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,780
And then people say, can I have wood?

1254
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
I don't think so.

1255
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,780
I already did it.

1256
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,700
So, I'll do something else, thanks.

1257
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,180
What is your question?

1258
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:09,980
Now, I don't want them to stop, but I do need to know what to tell my mom, because I'm home

1259
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,740
from the summer from school.

1260
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,940
I'm out there with an angle grinder, going ham.

1261
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,940
Yeah.

1262
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,940
What do I say to her?

1263
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,940
Put on some goggles.

1264
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,940
It's way too loud.

1265
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,940
Trav, that was way too loud.

1266
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,060
That was unamplified for me.

1267
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,060
Hey, mom.

1268
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,060
I'll try it.

1269
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,060
Let me try it like this.

1270
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,060
No, no, no.

1271
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,060
Back off, mom.

1272
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
Put on some goggles.

1273
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,060
I'm working.

1274
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,060
And now some ASMR.

1275
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:44,060
Can you make your mom like a custom blade?

1276
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:55,420
Are your friends paying for these swords?

1277
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,420
One, yes.

1278
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,420
Two, no.

1279
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,420
Oh, hey.

1280
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,420
Guess what?

1281
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,420
You only have to make one sword.

1282
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,420
Yeah.

1283
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,420
Yeah.

1284
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,540
And also, it's a part-time job.

1285
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,540
Moms love part-time jobs.

1286
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,540
They're wild about it.

1287
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,540
Yeah.

1288
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,700
If you can say to your mom, I'm making money off of this, slam dunk.

1289
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:18,580
But when you say, they asked, and so I just started, everyone in your life should tell

1290
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,580
you not to do that.

1291
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,700
Hey, I've done blacksmithing.

1292
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,220
It's really hard.

1293
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,620
Don't make swords for free.

1294
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,420
It's a romantic gesture, one of them.

1295
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,420
It's...

1296
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,420
Okay.

1297
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,420
All right.

1298
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,420
All right.

1299
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,140
Wait, and now we didn't know romance was involved.

1300
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,820
You can give them a discount.

1301
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,860
A 69% discount.

1302
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,860
Yeah.

1303
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,260
They're going to lose it.

1304
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,260
They're going to lose it.

1305
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,260
What?

1306
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Oh, okay.

1307
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,260
You wanted to...

1308
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,380
Justin, he said the...

1309
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,380
He said the...

1310
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,380
Did you hear?

1311
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,300
Oh, the sex thumb.

1312
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,020
This hand is injured, so I only have the one option.

1313
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:09,140
I hurt myself carrying bags because I'm old.

1314
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:13,260
And I've also reached an age when I say that and people go, no, it's not a joke, and they

1315
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,260
don't laugh, and it makes me sad.

1316
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,260
Does that...

1317
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:22,660
I mean, I know the answer, but does that help what we've said?

1318
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,260
I think enough because she's right up there.

1319
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,260
Okay.

1320
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,260
Hey.

1321
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,260
All right.

1322
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,260
Back off, mom.

1323
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,260
So cool.

1324
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,260
You brought your mom?

1325
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:43,540
We don't spend enough time telling mom what's up on this show.

1326
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,540
Hey, how's it going?

1327
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,540
Can I say something?

1328
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,980
It's been a while since we've done live shows or still working on The Dancer.

1329
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,340
I never do this, but that's a great shirt.

1330
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Thank you.

1331
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,340
Yeah, I'd wear that.

1332
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,340
That's a real Justin shirt.

1333
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,340
You don't wear that.

1334
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,340
Give it to us.

1335
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,340
No, no, no.

1336
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,340
Don't.

1337
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,340
I can't.

1338
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,540
As we've said, everyone needs to hide their bodies, okay?

1339
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,140
But if you had another shirt under there that looked exactly like my shirt...

1340
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,140
Travis, let the person talk.

1341
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,140
Okay.

1342
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Hello, who are you?

1343
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,140
My name is Dom.

1344
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,140
Hi, Dom.

1345
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,140
Hi, Dom.

1346
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,140
Hi.

1347
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,580
So I have a squatty potty.

1348
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,580
Nice.

1349
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,580
Brag.

1350
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,220
Yeah, great.

1351
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,900
Really choice, made out of wood, just beautiful, sits under my...

1352
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:32,460
Everyone in the audience just had the same incredibly specific reaction of like, what?

1353
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,940
It's the thing you put your feet up on.

1354
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,940
Oh yeah, we know.

1355
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,940
We stand the squatty potty here.

1357
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,940
It's great.

1358
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,940
My brother, my brother and me.

1359
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,940
It's great.

1360
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,940
If you don't know, it's a...

1361
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,940
You've been pooping wrong.

1362
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,940
Your entire life.

1363
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,340
I'm sorry to break the news to you, but the squatty potty makes you poop right.

1364
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:54,740
What's great is I think that the Venn diagram of people with kids and older people who care

1365
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,940
about squatty bodies is a perfect circle.

1366
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,940
Yeah, for sure.

1367
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,820
Like, whatever's going to make things go faster down there.

1368
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,820
Yeah, great.

1369
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,820
Love it.

1370
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,820
So I can get right back to parenting.

1371
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,820
Yeah, if you don't...

1372
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,220
So if you don't know, it pushes your legs, your knees up in the air.

1373
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,740
So your butthole doesn't look so stupid.

1374
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,740
Thank you.

1375
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,740
Thank you.

1376
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,700
So you can blow it right the fuck out.

1377
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,220
It also improves your aim for whales.

1378
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,220
Okay.

1379
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:24,700
So anyway, I did not know squatty potty was doing tasteful wood numbers.

1380
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,140
I assume this is something you assembled.

1381
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,260
Now looking at that, that's an IKEA squatty.

1382
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,340
That's like a squinty pootty.

1383
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
Where did you...

1384
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
A squinty pootty.

1385
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:38,860
It's a squinty pootty.

1386
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,060
Four hours to assemble it and then blah, blah, blah.

1387
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,660
You know, IKEA humor.

1388
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
Okay.

1389
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:51,380
Hey, have you guys ever dissociated while doing a live show?

1390
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,380
Okay.

1391
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,100
So what is your question about the squatty potty?

1392
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,620
Well, it's nice enough to show off.

1393
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,620
Yeah.

1394
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,620
Oh, obviously.

1395
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,100
I don't know if I want to.

1396
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,100
Okay.

1397
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,100
With COVID and everything.

1398
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,100
Yeah.

1399
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,100
Doing what it's doing.

1400
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,100
Wait.

1401
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,100
Okay.

1402
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,580
There are definitely parts of your body that I'm afraid of COVID on, bottom of your feet.

1403
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,580
Not one of them.

1404
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,580
Fair enough.

1405
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,580
I...

1406
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,580
Hmm.

1407
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,020
I guess I'd rather should I hide it or not.

1408
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,020
No!

1409
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,660
Who's the whore at that point?

1410
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,660
I guess you.

1411
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,740
That was a stupid thing to say, huh?

1412
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,740
I think it's...

1413
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,140
You're also talking to three men with bidets in their house, by the way, which is always

1414
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,140
great when a guest comes over and you're like, try it, and they're like, not now.

1415
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,420
There is no way to start to explain to someone that you have a bidet in your house and not

1416
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,900
end it with, forget I said anything.

1417
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,900
Yeah.

1418
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:49,380
Having someone that you have a bidet is a 100% guaranteed way to make sure they will

1419
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,220
not use the bathroom at your house.

1420
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,220
Yeah.

1421
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,220
There's no way.

1422
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:58,020
Because the two options are, one, they go in the bidet room and you give them a, have

1423
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,940
fun, enjoy.

1424
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,740
Or the afterwards, like, did you?

1425
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,700
Well, how did I go?

1426
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,340
Or that they don't know what the fuck they're doing in there and they make a big, bad bidet.

1427
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,340
And they blast off.

1428
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,340
Yeah.

1429
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,820
Why do they keep putting blast off buttons on bidets?

1430
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,260
And label them.

1431
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,460
It's hilarious, but I fixed the roof three times.

1432
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,740
I'm done.

1433
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:26,420
I think that if you show someone that you have a squatting potty, I think it introduces

1434
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,980
to them this idea that they've pooped around their whole life and I don't think that's

1435
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,980
very nice.

1436
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,700
I think it's kind of like you just lost the game, right?

1437
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:40,500
Like, I don't think you should introduce, oh, sorry about that to everybody.

1438
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
I don't think you should introduce this.

1439
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,500
You were.

1440
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Okay.

1441
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:50,180
Were you happier before you found out in your beautiful ignorance that you pooped wrong

1442
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,180
your whole life?

1443
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,380
Listen, it took longer, but you were happy.

1444
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,340
Anytime you go to a Buc-ee's or a Wawa, do you need to use the bathroom?

1445
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,300
And it's just like this, I know I'm doing this wrong.

1446
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,300
Is it this hard for everyone?

1447
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,300
Why isn't the floor six inches higher?

1448
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,300
Hey, this sucks, right?

1449
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:09,300
Hey, give me two of those cases of Pepsi in here.

1450
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:20,060
No reason, I'm going to fashion my own DIY.

1451
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,620
Were you happier before you knew?

1452
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,020
It's been pretty great since.

1453
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,020
Yeah.

1454
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,860
That's hard to answer because we all used to be happier.

1455
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,860
Wait great since?

1456
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,380
Are you telling me it fixes that too?

1457
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,900
No, we all learned about this the same way.

1458
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,700
We were just doom-scrolling on Facebook and saw the ad come up with the 3D diagram of

1459
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,900
our stupid idiot all squinched up colon.

1460
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,900
And the unicorn pooping, that was it, right?

1461
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,280
Yeah, and that's it.

1462
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,980
They were good commercials because pretty much they were instantly like, as you're

1463
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,740
scrolling through, it's just like, patriotic naughty, baby I don't care about.

1464
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,740
You're pooping wrong!

1465
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,740
Whoa, hold on.

1466
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,740
Back up.

1467
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,740
Because on some level, I always knew.

1468
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,740
I did.

1469
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:10,180
This can't be right, this can't be how I was intended, this can't be the best version

1470
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,180
of this.

1471
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:17,360
Can I, I'm going to do a little fun little, see if I can soothsay this a little bit.

1472
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:24,180
I am guessing, based on the fact that you bought a wooden squatty potty, that you owned

1473
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:28,660
earlier a crude plastic squatty potty, yes?

1474
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:32,020
It was more of like a trash can or anything I could find.

1475
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,300
Wait, wait, hey, wait.

1476
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,300
That, you know that's not the same, yeah?

1477
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,100
And when you say it was like a trash can, it was a trash can, right?

1478
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,980
Yeah, it was a nice gold trash can.

1479
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:50,980
So you could also do bongos.

1480
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,980
I think that you now must tell everyone you have a squatty potty.

1481
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:01,020
I've decided it's no longer advice, it's a sentence.

1482
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,900
You must tell everyone, and then you say, and then you look at them dead in the eyes

1483
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,460
and say, don't laugh, I used to use a trash can.

1484
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,100
Well, it was like a trash can.

1485
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:21,340
It was my off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off Broadway production of Bring

1486
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,140
Into Noise, Bring Into Funk.

1487
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,340
I brought in a lot of funk.

1488
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:28,380
The funk outweighed the noise.

1489
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,620
Does that help you?

1490
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,620
Absolutely.

1491
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,620
Thank you.

1492
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,620
Thank you.

1493
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,620
What a relief.

1494
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,620
Hello.

1495
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,620
Hello.

1496
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,620
Who are you?

1497
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,620
My name is Mary Beth.

1498
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,620
Hi, Mary Beth.

1499
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,620
My pronouns are she, they.

1500
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,620
Thank you.

1501
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:52,300
And my question is, how many copies of Space Jam, the first one?

1502
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,900
Thank you for clarifying.

1503
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,740
It's 100% incredibly meaningful.

1504
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Go ahead.

1505
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,300
Should, is it okay to own?

1506
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,180
We have six.

1507
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,180
You have six.

1508
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,660
We have five DVDs and one Blu-ray.

1509
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,540
My husband wanted to make the distinction.

1510
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,540
Okay.

1511
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,540
Thank you.

1512
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,620
Certainly that changes the English on this.

1513
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:19,300
And so Mary Beth, just contextually, when you say we have six, is that the right?

1514
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
Your husband has six, right?

1515
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
Yeah.

1516
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,300
Okay, fine.

1517
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,020
Unless you have one and he has five, okay.

1518
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,020
They are all his.

1519
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,020
Okay.

1520
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,020
Okay.

1521
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,620
You made a statement about this backstage and I want you to repeat it, because I have

1522
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,620
feelings and I've saved them.

1523
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,620
Okay.

1524
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:43,780
The number of copies of Space Jam that is too many to own is two copies of Space Jam.

1525
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,580
Because, and here's the only reason why I feel like that.

1526
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,580
Wait, wait, wait.

1527
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,100
Just a, sorry.

1528
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
Physical copies?

1529
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:57,340
No, I would count digital among us.

1530
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:05,420
The one copy of Space Jam is going to have all of Space Jam on it.

1531
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:08,380
No, no, no, no.

1532
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,380
Let me tell you why.

1533
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,420
Let me tell you why you're wrong and I love you so much.

1534
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,060
No, hold on, wait.

1535
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,620
There's no way I'm wrong.

1536
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:22,380
They really do put all of Space Jam right on the one DVD.

1537
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,380
Okay.

1538
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,220
You've never heard the term special edition?

1539
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:30,700
You already own Space Jam.

1540
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,700
What's that?

1541
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,700
A new version comes out.

1542
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,100
Not only that, you need a legacy version to give to your kids and your grandkids.

1543
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,380
There's one you watch and there's one you protect.

1544
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,900
I am 35 years old.

1545
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:49,460
DVDs were invented well after I was born.

1546
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:55,740
I do not own any more DVDs, nor do I know where to acquire a DVD player on which to

1547
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,740
play them.

1548
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,580
Putting a lot of faith in the cloud, Griffin.

1549
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,620
Yeah, it's a lot of cloud faith.

1550
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:05,660
A thing that is often associated with the word dissipate.

1551
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,660
Wow.

1552
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,660
Think about it.

1553
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,660
Sheep.

1554
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:23,460
You've got to have one for the car because your kids are like, Space Jam, Space Jam.

1555
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:30,340
We took a tour bus on our last tour, or two tours ago, and they had a copy of Space Jam

1556
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,340
in there.

1557
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,620
I doubt that's their home copy or their personal car copy.

1558
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:39,220
You need a Space Jam for car, Space Jam for home, Space Jam for business.

1559
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,260
Yes, thank you, Travis.

1560
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,700
A business Space Jam.

1561
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,420
Oh, this is my professional Space Jam.

1562
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:49,100
You got to save one copy just in case.

1563
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,100
Yeah.

1564
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,100
For special occasion.

1565
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,380
No, no, no, just like you need one behind glass, right?

1566
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,740
In the deposit box of the bank.

1567
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:00,500
I love that you guys were like, you put a lot of faith in the cloud, and then you're

1568
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:06,620
like, here's all of our Space Jam Horcruxes that we fucking embedded throughout the fabric

1569
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,620
of time and space.

1570
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,100
No, I'm sorry, but Mary Beth even made the point.

1571
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:19,260
Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, LaserDisc, vinyl, MiniDisc, they change these movies.

1572
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,780
This is a thumb drive that I've just written Space Jam on.

1573
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:27,420
Space Jam used to be on it, but now it's season three of Great British Bake Off.

1574
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,580
You all remember, you're old enough to remember what they did in the Star Wars, right?

1575
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,960
What if they do that to Space Jam and you can't get the good one anymore, but you do

1576
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,620
need to own a copy of it just to... Oh, okay, so-

1577
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,620
Don't.

1578
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,620
Don't.

1579
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,620
Don't.

1580
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:52,860
I think, okay, so I've proven four mathematically, home, car, business, just in cases.

1581
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,700
And then a streaming one, that's five.

1582
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,180
One of the physical ones came with a digital version where you enter the code, so that's

1583
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,180
five.

1584
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,860
Yeah, but you're not going to get that across all your devices.

1585
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:10,220
I bet y'all, I'm not even on the Wi-Fi, I bet you in 60 seconds I could be watching

1586
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,220
Space Jam.

1587
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,220
Okay.

1588
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,220
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1589
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,100
We have a timer right in front of us.

1590
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,100
I'm going to hit it though.

1591
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,100
All right.

1592
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,100
Okay.

1593
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,100
At 410, I'm going to start it.

1594
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,100
Yeah.

1595
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,100
Ready?

1596
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,100
On your mark, get set, go.

1597
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,100
All right.

1598
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,100
Wrap up.

1599
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,100
Does that help?

1600
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,100
Hey, does that help?

1601
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,100
Yes, thank you very much.

1602
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Okay, thank you so much.

1603
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,100
Okay, I have 60 seconds.

1604
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:36,020
Thank you to Tyler Reed for our posters, thank you to Paul Sabourin, thank you to Rachel

1605
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:41,700
Jacobs over there recording us, thank you to Amanda and Nate and Shannon, one of our

1606
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,500
amazing staff members who's here, Shannon Griffin, still trying to watch Space Jam.

1607
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,860
We're at 25 seconds.

1608
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:53,420
Thank you to Clinton McElroy, his wife Carol who made the journey with him and keeps him

1609
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,580
from wandering into traffic.

1610
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:59,660
Thanks to Sam from AEG who helped put the show together.

1611
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,660
Thank you, Sam.

1612
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,420
Thanks to the Balboa, always a beautiful place to do a show.

1613
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,420
We really appreciate it.

1614
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,420
45 seconds.

1615
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,420
Love you.

1616
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,420
We'll be back tomorrow to do Taz, but it's going to be a good one.

1617
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,420
What?

1618
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,420
Griffin?

1619
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,420
What's wrong, Griff?

1620
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,060
HBO Max is denying you, eh?

1621
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,620
Amazon Prime wants my five-digit video pin.

1622
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,620
That's a minute.

1623
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,620
Goddamn it.

1624
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,300
59.93, he didn't do it.

1625
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,420
Griffin sucks, everybody.

1626
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,420
Griffin as a reccom...

1627
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:36,020
Oh, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

1628
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,580
Griffin, seeing as you failed the bet...

1629
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:44,420
I spent $7 to rent Space Jam 1.

1630
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,420
I'd like to hear your...

1631
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,100
To win an imaginary contest.

1632
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:56,220
I would like, as recompense, I would like to hear your impression of Bugs Bunny telling

1633
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,020
everybody how badly you fucked up.

1634
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,380
Shhh, you don't want to miss this, folks.

1635
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,180
I've heard it's Bugs and it's out of this world.

1636
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:15,620
Nyeh, I, nyeh, what a, what a fucking idiot.

1637
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,620
Griffin, he's Justin McElroy.

1638
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1639
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,620
Griffin McElroy.

1640
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:36,980
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kids, Your Dad, Square on the Lips.

1641
01:12:36,980 --> 01:13:03,740
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kids, Your Dad, Square on the Lips.
