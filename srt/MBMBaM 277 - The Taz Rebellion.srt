1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,800
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I want it.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Just say, hey, I want it.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to our brother-brother-mean-advice show for the

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
Machinera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,200
Gang, T-G-I-F. It's your boy, Griffin McElroy.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
T-G-I-F.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,400
F stands for fuck day, doesn't it? I don't know.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,960
Wait, hold on. Thank goodness it's fuck day.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
How lazy this program has gotten with the cursing and just the language.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Let's start it. Start it over.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,760
Okay. Hey, everybody.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,640
It's J-Slizzle here on the MIC. It's M-B-M-B-A-M and me, brother and me.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,160
I'm Travis, middle-est.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,320
Thank God it's fuck day. That was like a little dog made out of air horns.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Walked into your fucking honeypot again.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,240
We're recording this on a Friday, so that means there's so much different material.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,040
We rarely ever record on a Friday.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,960
We have new stuff that we can talk about that we normally couldn't, like what's new in theaters

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
opening this week? What's happening?

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Doesn't Avengers come out this weekend?

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,520
Avengers is next weekend.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
This weekend, we've got the 33, which is about Chilean miners.

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Love the Cooper.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Love the Coopers.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
By the Sea, kind of a movie.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,000
This is By the Sea Watch 2015.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Commit to the bit. It's By the Sea Watch 2015.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,080
Okay. Welcome to By the Sea Watch 2015, where we're checking in on the new film By the Sea,

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,880
starring Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,600
What? They're working together on a project?

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,040
They're back.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
It's about an American writer named Roland and his wife Vanessa who arrive in a tranquil

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
and picturesque sea resort in 1970s France.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
That sounds nice, but there's a comma.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
Their marriage in apparent crisis.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh, boy.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,320
And also, Loki's there. He's stirring up the pot.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,440
Dang, I got to race to the Burger King and pick up one of the commemorative frosted glasses

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
for Take This Sea.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,520
Does everybody have their Melanie Laurent action figures?

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
Because I know I do.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, I don't know why they did multiples of them, but I'm excited to have the whole set.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
Because you got to have the chase figure. There's one where she's in sort of a floppy sun hat.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,440
Yeah.

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,320
There's another one where she's smoking two cigarettes at the Riviera.

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,760
I got the amiibo. I got the Melanie Laurent amiibo and you plug it into Mario Party 10,

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,840
and then all of a sudden she's there and she's hanging out with Bowser and Sonic and friends.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,240
Did you get the one where you put vegetable oil in the little hole in her back and you crank the

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,360
wheel and real sadness emanates from her?

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760
What did you say there? What were all those words?

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,240
Travis was referencing a Darkwing Duck gas grenade gun that would shoot smoke

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,520
if you put vegetable oil on it.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
It never worked, really?

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,240
No, it did not. It was the most disappointing toy of my entire childhood.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,320
Yeah, it's really bad. Also, that reference, just so I understand, that was on par with you

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,160
making an inside joke about a thing that's in your pocket that nobody else could possibly know about.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
You don't think other people got and were disappointed by the Darkwing Duck?

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,000
The shitty Darkwing Duck gun? No, gang, I want to talk about this fucking unstoppable

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,640
potential energy that the weekend holds. You're not excited about this intro, I can tell.

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,400
But listen, anything can happen on Saturday, anything can happen on Sunday.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm sick of recording this show on Sunday knowing what has happened on Saturday and Sunday.

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
It's all about potential energy.

69
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't have that anymore in my life. My weekends are now,

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
they're dictated by my baby wakes up at 5 30 in the morning and that's my-

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,480
More time to party, more potential energy.

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah, think of all the partying you could get done in a single day.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
I've never been to a 5 30 a.m. party, Justin. What are they like?

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Well, you watch Little Einsteins and eat some cheesy poofs.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,000
Nice.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,760
Now, what's a cheesy poof? Is that like a Cheeto?

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,280
No, it's like a Cheeto, but it is a single piece of puffed corn,

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,440
hulless puffed corn.

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
And what kind of psychedelic effects do the puffed corn have?

80
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
There, there, no, there's no, okay, I can see what you've done there.

81
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
There's no psychedelic effects because you give them to your baby when you're just like,

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,400
not, your heart's not in it at that exact moment. You know what I mean?

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
It's like a-

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
Your heart's just not in it right now.

85
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,840
Yeah, it's sort of a, it's like a baby tapas for the disillusioned dad.

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
Yeah, that's, wow, that's actually on the box. I didn't know you've gotten those before.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,040
There's Chester Cheeto on the front like,

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,040
enjoy these baby tapas for the disillusioned pops.

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
And he smokes a cigarette. He's smoking a cigarette on this one.

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
That's crazy.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,320
And blowing it in your face. You gotta put vegetable oil in for it to do it.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah, please add vegetable oil to this bag of shitty Cheetos.

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Okay, listen, it's an advice show for the modern era.

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
Let's fucking help some people for once out.

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,600
Can we-

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Live.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
Should we also address the fact that I feel like we recorded an episode like 15 minutes ago?

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
Yeah, this must be what it's like to have a job where you work every day.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh, I hate it.

100
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, but that doesn't matter because this is about to be a great, great episode.

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,520
All right, rip the-

102
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,240
Did you guys know-

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Rip the shit.

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you guys hear about that?

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,320
I saw it on Huffington Post.

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,200
My four and a half year old son has red hair and is generally regarded as being adorable.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,640
Frequently, when in a public space, a stranger, usually middle-aged or older woman,

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,240
will comment on the color of his hair.

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,200
Sometimes they will say it's beautiful, but more often they will say something like,

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
oh, look at that red hair.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,000
I never know how to respond to this.

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,800
Their tone is probably not like mine.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
I appreciate that they want to compliment him or something he has no control over,

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,200
but the statement is usually followed by an awkward silence and maybe like a,

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,880
yeah, with a forced chuckle.

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,880
Is there a way I can acknowledge their compliment gracefully?

117
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
That's from Josh.

118
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Just rip out a clump.

119
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,320
Give them.

120
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
Give them some.

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,600
Give them a piece.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Take a clump.

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,000
It'll last longer.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,120
A sample for you to take.

125
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Stuart, be quiet.

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
You know the arrangement that we have.

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
Here, eat this shitty top.

128
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Eat this crunchy top of us.

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
You patchy little ding dong.

130
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,240
This is one of the reasons I hate small talk,

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,000
but don't you think, what do you think the compliment giver in this scenario

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
is expecting in the response?

133
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Look at that red hair.

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,160
Ah, I see you've noticed his red hair.

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,800
Come with me.

136
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,640
I think that ha ha, yeah, is exactly what they expect and all you need to give.

137
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah, you could also just make a sort of another observation

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
just sort of about your immediate surroundings.

139
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,880
Like, oh yeah, and there's some soup.

140
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
Look at that green tree.

141
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Hmm.

142
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,080
Maybe notice, maybe notice something on them.

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Hey, there's a purple sweatshirt with a wolf on it.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,360
That's sweet.

145
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,080
That's really cool.

146
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
Pretty badass sweatshirt.

147
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,760
Trade you.

148
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Where'd you get that?

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,200
Trade you.

150
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
Color for color.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Give you some of this boy's sweet hair.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Give me a sleeve.

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm working on a spell.

154
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
It's one of the components I need.

155
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
See, my wife, her dad stole some beans.

156
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
Shit's crazy.

157
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,960
Anyway, can't get her knocked up.

158
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,800
Unless I have a clump as red as blood as sleep as purple as magic.

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Hey, speaking of sleeves as purple as magic,

160
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
I picked up Riley, my 15-year-old sister-in-law

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
from the high school yesterday.

162
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,680
And there was a, I saw a,

163
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,600
I was asking her about some of the teens in the area.

164
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,520
Teen fashion update.

165
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,080
Teen fashion update with Justin McElroy.

166
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,080
You guys are gonna feel bad when I finish this.

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,040
I asked her, you know, about some of the teens

168
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
that were surrounding our car.

169
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Just kind of making small talk about teens.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,120
And I saw this fucking dope-ass kid,

171
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,600
like jangly, crazy Jim Morrison hair,

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,520
and wearing a Huntington Blizzard sweatshirt.

173
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,840
Fuck, yes, yes, yes, yes.

174
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,120
I almost hopped out of, okay,

175
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
super quick Huntington Blizzard is the long defunct.

176
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
Long defunct, very defunct.

177
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,040
I would argue it was defunct while it was still fun.

178
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Every player on the Huntington Blizzard

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,240
was also looking for other jobs.

180
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,520
Yeah, it was a minor league,

181
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,680
a long defunct minor league hockey team.

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Probably our closest brush with professional sports.

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,720
We have the arena football team, the locomotives.

184
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,440
That's true, we did have that.

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
But we had the Huntington Blizzard,

186
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
which made like, considering it was hockey,

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,520
which is not a huge sport around here,

188
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
it hung in there pretty good.

189
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
It did, they did pretty well.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,400
This fucking kid was wearing a Huntington Blizzard sweatshirt.

191
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,880
I almost got out of the car and offered to buy it from him,

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,520
so I could, I don't know, use as a bandana or something,

193
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,840
because it certainly wasn't gonna fit my frame.

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,120
But I just wanted to update you guys on that.

195
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
And this has been the teen fashion update.

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
When you asked Riley about that kid,

197
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,800
was she like, oh, he just keeps showing up.

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
I don't think he's a student.

199
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Did she give you any background on how awesome this kid was?

200
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
She said that she knows him.

201
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
And I was like, can I get an introducio?

202
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
And she was like, I think that would be inappropriate.

203
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,160
I was like, okay, I'll just stop and introduce myself.

204
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
Did you run up to him and try and put a hand on that shirt,

205
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
but your hand phased completely through him

206
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
because he's a ghost that was murdered in 1996?

207
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,000
At the height of Blizzard fever.

208
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
When you see a kid like that, are you like me?

209
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,840
And do you think that kid is either super cool

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,040
or like a total outcast, right?

211
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
Either he's like really ironic and on point with it,

212
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
or it's like, oh God, there's the kid

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
who wears the Blizzard sweatshirt every day.

214
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
Who knows?

215
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Watch any coming of age movie released nowadays.

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,040
I'm talking about your Paper Towns.

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm talking about your Yumi and Dupree.

218
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,920
That's not funny.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
You know the teen comedy.

220
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,200
Your Marmaduke.

221
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Marmaduke.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
And it's just like the kids.

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
Your drill bit tailors.

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,520
The artsy kids are the ones that are making it happen.

225
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,680
And that was not true.

226
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
I hung out with a group of people.

227
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,080
One of them had a fan website about Final Fantasy III.

228
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,960
And that was sort of the par for the course.

229
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,600
And we were, I think, on that Paper Towns style.

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
And we were derided.

231
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
I think that's a side effect of consolidated high schools.

232
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
There's so many students there that a true fiefdom

233
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
of popularity cannot form.

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,280
There are more like warring clans.

235
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,920
You know what I mean?

236
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Do you guys want me to-

237
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,560
I can mean girls?

238
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah.

239
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,280
Yeah, please.

240
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,920
You remember.

241
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh my God.

242
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
Fucking perfect.

243
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
Transitione thank you to my man, level 9000 Yadru Drew,

244
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
Drew Davenport.

245
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Thank you, Drew.

246
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
It's by Yadru Answers user Tyler who asks,

247
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
and let's be cool about this.

248
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
Can we make an agreement to be fucking cool about this for once?

249
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

250
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Justin, I need a verbal confirmation.

251
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, I'll be cool.

252
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,720
I was not paying attention to what I agreed to be cool to.

253
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't think either of you did.

254
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
That was crazy.

255
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,720
I was letting my cat out of the room.

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
It was very important.

257
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,160
Well, you also let the cat out of the bag

258
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
that you're an inconsiderate brother.

259
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,640
Yup.

260
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,760
Tyler asks, and let's be cool about this.

261
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Is a team a quote unquote nerd if they use a pocket watch?

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Update.

263
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Just recently my phone was fried when it fell in some water

264
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
and I lost my wristwatch.

265
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,160
Also, I am an avid Doctor Who fan, so I opted to get a pocket watch.

266
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,760
Man, I would have been good buddies with this guy

267
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
it sounds like in high school.

268
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
I am not the most social person, but I still want to be normal.

269
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,680
I know that people tell you to be your own person,

270
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
but in reality, this advice is not necessarily applicable.

271
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
I had some trouble with that word.

272
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,920
So I ask again, if a teen wears a pocket watch,

273
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,720
will they be made fun of or labeled a nerd?

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Keep in mind, this watch will usually be in the pocket of jeans.

275
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,320
Ah, I'm so glad.

276
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm so glad he clarified because I was about to say

277
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,760
it depends on how whole hog he goes with it.

278
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,040
Don't vote for pocket watch, it's in the pocket of big jeans.

279
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,560
If he went like wested and like full on like a trouser

280
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,440
and some spats and like, you know, like a like tails

281
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
and he was like the dopest classiest dress kid in high school.

282
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,560
No, I think he's gone around the corner at that point and he's awesome.

283
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,640
If he's wearing a t-shirt and jeans and a pocket watch,

284
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,280
he is not fully committed to the look

285
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
and therefore, yes, but it's not because the pocket watch is nerdy.

286
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
It's because of his lack of commitment.

287
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,280
Can you, but like, okay.

288
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,720
You want him to look like a private dick is what you're saying?

289
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
You want to look like the lead singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies?

290
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
I would also accept lead singer of like your Panda at the Disco.

291
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,280
Yeah.

292
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,560
Right? That's a cool look.

293
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,800
I just, I think that every look is okay,

294
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,720
but you just, you have to be able to commit to it.

295
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
And like, this is an important thing

296
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
that I think a lot of people miss out on.

297
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,280
Like, if you get like, if you're worried about something being cool or normal

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,520
and it's something that's like outside the norm,

299
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,000
that can still be cool, but affectations aren't cool.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
So like, are you wearing a pocket?

301
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Like, if you are the sort of person where like,

302
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
it is natural to you to wear a pocket watch

303
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
for this reason and this reason and this reason,

304
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,680
you're an old soul and you only listen to fucking 40s on four

305
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
on Sirius XM or some shit.

306
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,840
And that's like, that's your life and you're living it

307
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
and you're owning it.

308
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
Then like, yeah, absolutely, pocket watch.

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
Own it and wear it and do it.

310
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,400
Let me name three names that if you saw them wearing a pocket watch,

311
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,040
you would say, yup, Paul F. Tompkins, John Hodgman, John Roderick.

312
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,840
No.

313
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,160
Johnny Depp.

314
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,200
Three super cool dudes.

315
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,920
Johnny Depp.

316
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Johnny Depp.

317
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Thank you.

318
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,600
Ronnie, Ronnie Depp.

319
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
Johnny's twin brother who you never hear about.

320
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,000
Ronnie Depp works at the clock factory.

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, Ronnie James Dio.

322
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah, he also works at the clock factory

323
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,440
and they need those pocket watches to keep all their shit on time.

324
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,840
I've worn a pocket watch before.

325
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,640
Well, we've all worn some shit, Travis.

326
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,760
Well, like in a suit form, I was in a suit.

327
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,800
It's a good look when you're a three-piece suit with a vest

328
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,200
with the pocket specifically meant for the watch to go into.

329
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
That makes sense.

330
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
That does make sense.

331
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,920
Not so much.

332
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,240
Jeans, not as much sense.

333
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,520
You're in high school and you have a pocket watch in your pocket

334
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,600
and you have on some aesthetic goggles you bought from Hot Topic.

335
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
There is also a clock in every room in high school.

336
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
That's a good point, Travis, and in the hallways.

337
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,440
Everywhere.

338
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah, you can't even be late for shit in high school.

339
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,680
There are people with like belts on telling you where to go constantly.

340
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,520
Oh my, it seems my 10.30 class has begun.

341
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm late.

342
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,160
That's never happened.

343
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,280
No, that's never happened.

344
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,480
You know another thing that's never happened on Earth

345
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,200
that was like probably the biggest lie propagated by TV and movies

346
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,440
in my young years that was like I was disillusioned by?

347
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
Free period.

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,320
Yeah.

349
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
You guys ever see that in any TV show movie?

350
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,640
Like, oh, I have a free period right now.

351
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,560
That does not exist.

352
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
I would lump Study Hall into that, too.

353
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
That's not a thing.

354
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,160
You know what drove me crazy in like teen movies based in high school

355
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,680
is sometimes in those movies, the boys and the girls would kiss each other.

356
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,400
Like, magical fantasy.

357
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Get real.

358
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,240
It doesn't happen.

359
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,200
And they would go to like parties in high school?

360
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,480
More importantly, proceeding that they'd be invited to one or two.

361
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,920
No, no, no.

362
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,760
Yeah, I saw one shot of a movie where there was this kid who was in high school

363
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,600
and it showed the clock and his clock said 11 30 p.m.

364
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,160
And I was like, continuity error over here.

365
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,200
Get the DP.

366
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,840
We're going to reshoot this scene because who's up that late?

367
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,400
Nobody.

368
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,200
Don't wear a pocket watch.

369
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,240
Don't wear a pocket watch.

370
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
Unless you're the type of person who wears a boneless.

371
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,880
You're probably just not like you really take a look at your look.

372
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,840
Are you completely owning the being a pocket watch person?

373
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,960
You can't start from the pocket watch and build from there.

374
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
That's why it's called an accessory.

375
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,760
I feel like that's a good rule of thumb for like, affectation.

376
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,600
If you have to stop and think, am I the type of person who could?

377
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,080
You're not.

378
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,400
Like, it should be just like second nature that you're like,

379
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
oh, got to pick up a pocket watch today.

380
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,600
Like, it's just on your list of things to do and not like,

381
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,280
I am making a commitment to a whole new me with this accessory.

382
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
Like, no.

383
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
I don't necessarily 100% agree with you there Trav.

384
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,360
Sometimes you just got to throw your hat over the fence and say,

385
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,640
this is going to be a hard struggle,

386
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
but I am going to start with the pocket watch.

387
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,040
And I know that I'm going to look like an asshole for a little while,

388
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,320
but I got to start somewhere.

389
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,360
You got to commit to this.

390
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
Sometimes you just got to throw your watch into your pocket.

391
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,720
And then throw your pocket over the fence.

392
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
My pants.

393
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
How about another question?

394
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,160
Yeah.

395
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,480
Whoa.

396
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
My boyfriend and I are looking at moving out together.

397
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,760
The only problem is I would rather share roommates with roommates we don't know.

398
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,240
And he would rather move in with his friends.

399
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
Renting with just us would be a little pricey

400
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,680
and would mean we would have to wait longer

401
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,920
to find a place in our price range that is nice.

402
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,600
How do we resolve this?

403
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
That's some Jess.

404
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I kind of get this.

405
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah.

406
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,720
I've only ever lived with people I knew,

407
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,520
but that's always been to varying degrees of how well I knew them.

408
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,960
And there is something to be said that if you move in with people you know too well,

409
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,840
that kind of familiarity can breed a little bit of friction.

410
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,560
You know, there is like something tempting to that idea of like,

411
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,560
oh, my roommate is just like a random person I met through a service

412
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
and we see each other in the morning

413
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
and sometimes run into each other when we come home from work,

414
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
but we're under no onus to like hang out

415
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
or like have dinner together or do shit together.

416
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
We're just sharing a space and that's it.

417
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
Especially if you're moving in

418
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
and like your significant other is coming with you.

419
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,240
I don't know.

420
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
There's something to be said about the idea of like,

421
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
they're just another person living in this space.

422
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
A random roommate is just a friend that you don't hate yet.

423
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
Exactly.

424
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,160
But you'll get there.

425
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,960
It's just a friend that may never become a friend.

426
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,200
Yeah.

427
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
I would have a hard time with that.

428
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
I would feel obligated to try to get to know the person,

429
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
to try to get inside their head.

430
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,920
Let me in.

431
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,880
What's wrong with me?

432
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,520
You have easy access to me, whatever you want it.

433
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,680
Let's like make use of your resources,

434
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
your natural justice resources.

435
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,440
Every day you would just walk into their bedroom uninvited

436
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
and just be like, let's just hash this shit out, man.

437
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,320
Like, what are you talking?

438
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
I have nothing.

439
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
We have no beef to squash.

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
We have nothing.

441
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,360
We have nothing.

442
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,920
We don't have beef.

443
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,560
We don't have pork.

444
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,360
We don't have chicken.

445
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
We've got nothing between us, Derek.

446
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
Why did you eat all my meat?

447
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
There's nothing fishy.

448
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
I love this roommate.

449
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
I want to live with this guy.

450
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
He knows a lot about meats.

451
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He's good at meat based puns.

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
Listen, I was up all night.

453
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
I had a graveyard shift at the butcher shop

454
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
and I would just like to sleep place.

455
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,480
Thank you.

456
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
I left you the bacon in the fridge with your name on it.

457
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,680
What more do you want?

458
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,360
That would actually be a super cool roommate.

459
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,600
It'd be a good roommate, man.

460
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, yeah.

461
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I would love to live with a butcher I've never met before.

462
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,920
Griffin, are we going to return to your cockamamie theory

463
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,840
that everybody who's a butcher is doing it

464
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
so they have a cover for when they eventually murder somebody?

465
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
Uh, it's not cockamamie as much as it is

466
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
practical life-saving knowledge.

467
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Why, you wouldn't live with a butcher?

468
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,640
Um, I would not live with a butcher, no.

469
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
There's also something to be said though

470
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,520
to Jess's question, which is,

471
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
do you also know the potential roommates

472
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,160
your boyfriend wants to move in with?

473
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
Sounds like it, doesn't it?

474
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
But like, is it all your boyfriend's friends

475
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,400
and you don't really know them?

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
Because I could see where that would be a huge turnoff.

477
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, that would be really weird.

478
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
That would, I actually feel what Travis is saying here

479
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
of, yeah, then you're going to feel like

480
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
a third wheel in your own house.

481
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,560
Exactly.

482
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,480
And that dog don't hunt.

483
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,840
I don't know, what's the solution?

484
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,520
Just stop, everybody stop getting roommates

485
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,800
and live in Japanese capsule hotels in the Japanese style.

486
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,840
Oh my god, yes.

487
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,680
Oh my god, yes, Justin, you've made me so happy.

488
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:54,960
Yeah.

489
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
Justin, from downtown.

490
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
I didn't know you had that particular insight in you.

491
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,200
That's my one and I've been saving it.

492
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,680
Now, I don't think-

493
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,720
But if everybody would just live in Japanese capsule hotels.

494
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
Yeah, I don't think there are long-term Japanese capsule hotels

495
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,640
because they would be like little stinky garbage cans after a while.

496
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,280
Unless they rotated like every night

497
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,200
they moved them one to the left.

498
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Change places.

499
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Why would that be the worst?

500
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,040
What, because are they cleaning them between?

501
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,160
They're cleaning them between, yeah.

502
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,520
But you can't, once you've slept in a bed like 100 times

503
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
there's no getting that stink out.

504
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,320
You got to keep rotating.

505
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,800
That's true.

506
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
It's all about stink confusion.

507
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,680
You got to confuse those long-term Japanese capsule hotels.

508
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
Man, this is a great idea.

509
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,120
Austin would go gaga for this shit.

510
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Boutique, it's a boutique concept.

511
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
It's boutique, it's small, it's tiny living.

512
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,160
Yeah, tiny houses are huge right now.

513
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,360
Well, wait, hold on.

514
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,760
But imagine if you just like slept in a drawer

515
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
and at that point you're like, oh, you live in a tiny house?

516
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
Oh, I didn't know you were so wasteful.

517
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Do you really need that much space?

518
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
I sleep in basically a cabinet.

519
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm basically Peter Pan Shadow.

520
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,840
I basically just live in a drawer in Wendy's room.

521
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,920
I have eight hours of oxygen pumped in to my sleep coffin every night.

522
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,800
No more, no less.

523
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,520
No more, no less.

524
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,200
That's how non-wasteful I am.

525
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,800
Over sleep?

526
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,360
No, thank you.

527
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
I'd like to see another day, please.

528
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,640
No, no.

529
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
But tell me about your tiny house with its bathroom and shower.

530
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
Can I suggest a name for this gigantic capsule apartment

531
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,240
that we've come up with?

532
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,720
Yes.

533
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,440
How about just Sleep?

534
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
Because it's very utilitarian.

535
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
It's just like a place where you go to.

536
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Maybe it's built above a restaurant

537
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,600
where you're fed like a gelatinous protein cube

538
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,760
that provides you like your necessary nutrients.

539
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,480
No more, no less.

540
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,680
And that place is just called Eat.

541
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,560
Where's the umlaut go in Sleep?

542
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
No, it wouldn't be there, one.

543
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,440
There wouldn't be.

544
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,560
I love Sleep.

545
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,200
Let me give one tweet to it and see how this grabs you.

546
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,560
Sleep?

547
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,760
Very evocative.

548
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh, you can do what you want in there.

549
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
Fuck yes, and the dot in the question mark

550
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,520
is also a capsule that you can sleep in.

551
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,200
But you only rotate into it once a year.

552
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,560
But that's a great night's sleep.

553
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,680
Great view, too.

554
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,240
Great view.

555
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
Well, for everybody walking outside,

556
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,680
they can see like right up your sleeping tunic

557
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,160
that you have to wear when you enter the hotel.

558
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,840
Oh, this is good.

559
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
How about a Yahoo?

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Yeah, how about we hit you with a Yahoo?

561
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,640
This Yahoo was sent by Ira Ray.

562
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
Are you Ira Ray?

563
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,680
Who wants to know?

564
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Thank you, Ira.

565
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

566
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
Oh, something's gone wrong.

567
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,480
Let's call them Iowa Greg.

568
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,360
Iowa Greg asks,

569
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,600
what is the fastest way to eat corn on the cob?

570
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,760
Additional details.

571
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
It's for a corn on the cob eating contest.

572
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,040
You're disqualified right now,

573
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
because you're juicing it, you're cheating.

574
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,960
Yeah, that's the question.

575
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,520
If you ask, and I'm glad he clarified

576
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
that there were like rules and strictures,

577
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
because the easiest way is, of course,

578
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,160
to cut all the corn off of the cob.

579
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,800
But then I feel like that would be frowned upon

580
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
in a corn on the cob competition.

581
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,160
I would think so, yeah.

582
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,040
I would think so.

583
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,640
Maybe just no one thought to ask.

584
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,760
They bring you the plate and you're like,

585
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
could you cut it off for me before we start?

586
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
And they're like, actually, yeah.

587
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,680
Yeah, we can do that.

588
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,560
Cool, cool, cool.

589
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,120
Can you load it into this thing I have?

590
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,560
It's like a big PVC pipe with some hairspray cans

591
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,520
attached to the back of it.

592
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
And it says corn gun on it.

593
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,280
Can you just dump it right in there?

594
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,200
Yeah, I guess there's nothing in the bylaws

595
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
that says anything about corn guns.

596
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Go ahead and slop it in, I guess.

597
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Could you modify a t-shirt cannon

598
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
to just blast a copy right down your throat?

599
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,560
Just get a copy and just blast it clean down.

600
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I think that you could do that once.

601
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,480
Well, how much corn do you have to eat

602
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
for this competition?

603
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,200
Probably more than one ear, I would guess, right?

604
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
Yeah, oh, is it speed or is it amount?

605
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,160
Are you cleaning one cob or is it how many cobs

606
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,280
can you do in a set amount of time?

607
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,680
And I gotta tell you, Justin, down in the whole cob,

608
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,000
that just seems like you're wasting space in your tummy.

609
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
There's a lot of fiber and stuff in there

610
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
that they don't expect you to eat.

611
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,400
Obviously, they get very excited.

612
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
The judges get very excited

613
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
when they see somebody eat the entire cob,

614
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,920
core and all, but it's-

615
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,200
He's here to play.

616
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
Yeah, so everybody, you know,

617
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,560
everyone will throw one of those down during the run

618
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
just to like show off to the crowd a little bit.

619
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,920
But more than that, one sort of obligatory corn shot

620
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,920
and you're just, you know, you're not being efficient.

621
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,880
You know, I was sitting here thinking of how,

622
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,560
I tried to figure out how I would do

623
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,120
in a corn on the cob eating contest,

624
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
like trying to gin up a number

625
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,040
that represented how much corn I could eat.

626
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,560
And I realized something.

627
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,960
I don't really know because I can't think of a time in my life

628
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
when I finished an ear of corn out with the buttering

629
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
and the salting and the chewing and everything

630
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
and thought, yeah, I'm ready to go through that again,

631
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,920
one more again, pile it up, let me get another cob going.

632
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Like nobody's ever gotten full of corn on the cob.

633
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,560
They're just like, I can't do this anymore.

634
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,920
That was a lot of work.

635
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,600
It's a whole like process.

636
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,920
Like you can't just like, oh, I'm late for work.

637
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,120
Okay, I'm just gonna grab a corn on the cob to go.

638
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,720
Like it's a whole production.

639
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,840
You ever see that little kid in like 20s movies?

640
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,720
He's in his little Lord Fauntleroy outfit.

641
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,800
He's licking a big lollipop.

642
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
The closest you can get to that look as an adult

643
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,040
in a socially permissible setting

644
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,640
is eating a corn on the cob.

645
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,400
It's just like you got your little pinkies up

646
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,200
and you're just.

647
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
If this person's talking about going pro,

648
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
then I don't think they realize the sacrifices

649
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,960
that are gonna be required of them

650
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,040
because a lot of the corn pros out there

651
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,240
have gotten tooth reversal surgery.

652
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,360
And that's sort of where it's like a special kind of braces

653
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,040
that they put on your teeth

654
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,080
so that they all sort of bend backwards

655
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,120
like in towards your throat hole there

656
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
in the back of your mouth.

657
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,560
And like a sarlacc.

658
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
Kind of like a sarlacc, yeah,

659
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,240
like a reversal of the teeth direction.

660
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,600
And so they just jam a whole cob into their mouth

661
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
and a little bit into their throat.

662
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
And then as they pull it out,

663
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,160
their backwards teeth just do all the scraping for them.

664
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,200
And if you just get one clean go.

665
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,400
Do y'all do the typewriter

666
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,480
or are you doing a circle around the corn

667
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
and then move to the next circle?

668
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,920
Which way do you guys do it?

669
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,400
I just, I just, I shuck it with my fate.

670
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,120
What are you talking?

671
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,560
I just told you how I did it.

672
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
No, I mean now

673
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,320
without the professional tooth reversal surgery.

674
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
You do the typewriter like they do in them cartoons?

675
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm actually a fan of doing cut sees off sees.

676
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I don't fuck with that in between the teeth stuff.

677
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,320
Get that out of there.

678
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
Cause I want corn now.

679
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
I don't want corn tomorrow.

680
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,240
But what, okay.

681
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,960
Hypothetically you go to like visit a friend's house

682
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
and they're very strict

683
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,400
that you can not cut the corn off the cob.

684
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,760
It's a very fundamentalist corn household

685
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,400
and you have to eat it on the corn, on the cob.

686
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Do you do typewriter or do you do around the cob?

687
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
Okay, so in this situation

688
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
where this has happened to me once

689
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
cause it'll never happen to me a second time.

690
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
I guarantee you that

691
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,440
cause I'll never talk to any of the parties associated again.

692
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,800
I guess I would typewriter it Trav.

693
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,680
You caught me, okay?

694
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,640
That's the correct answer.

695
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,520
You did good Griffin.

696
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,560
I mean, it's not.

697
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,480
Given the circumstance that you've laid out at it,

698
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,400
I get it is the correct answer, I guess.

699
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,320
I like this big hunky chunky bites.

700
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,680
Man, can I just also say this aside?

701
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,800
Fuck, this is funny.

702
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,600
I can talk about how we like to eat corn for hours.

703
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,840
But unfortunately we have to go to the muddies then.

704
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:30,480
My brother, my brother and me is sponsored this week by Squarespace.

705
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,120
If you would like to make a website all about eating corn,

706
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,880
the funniest thing anyone could ever talk about ever.

707
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,160
I think we can all agree that you want to use Squarespace.

708
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,520
My brother, my brother and me is brought to you

709
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,960
in part by Squarespace, the all-in-one website platform.

710
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,720
Squarespace sites look professionally designed

711
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,920
regardless of your skill level and with no coding required.

712
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,040
Anybody can do this.

713
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,800
Anybody.

714
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Name somebody right now.

715
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,960
Justin, name somebody.

716
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
My baby Charlie.

717
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,360
She could do it.

718
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,480
Griffin, name somebody.

719
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,080
Anybody.

720
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Fucking Ron Perlman, I guess.

721
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,680
He could do it.

722
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,960
Justin, name somebody else.

723
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Ron Perlman?

724
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,480
Oh no, he can't do it.

725
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,120
Junior.

726
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
Oh yes, he can do it.

727
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, good.

728
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Don Perlman.

729
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,800
He is allowed to do it, but only once.

730
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,240
He can't do it, actually, that's the trick.

731
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,600
His flesh is made out of hardened white precious gems.

732
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,160
Oh, you got me.

733
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,760
Bull from night court, bull from night court,

734
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,720
bull from night court.

735
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,440
He can do it.

736
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,000
That's my next three.

737
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
That's my next three.

738
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,840
I want to get him out ahead of me.

739
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
Oh, yes, no, yes.

740
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,480
Griffin, one more.

741
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
Dr. Pizza.

742
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
Dr. Pizza could do it.

743
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,560
Anybody could do it.

744
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,960
I forgot, I ran out of people, okay?

745
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
You did fine, and here's the best thing.

Even Dr. Pizza could do it, and he's not even real.

755
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
Squarespace, Billy Beautiful.

756
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,400
Excuse me?

757
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,640
Sorry, he's not a real doctor.

758
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
He's more like a professor.

759
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Professor Pizza.

760
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you.

761
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,960
I have a message here, and it's for Cupcake,

762
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
AKA Kim, and it's from Muffin, AKA Joe.

763
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,640
And Muffin says to Cupcake,

764
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,560
happy fourth anniversary to the woman

765
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,640
with hopefully infinite patience.

766
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
You're an amazing mother and wife

767
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,320
and the love of my life.

768
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,920
PS, ramblesnatch.

769
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:44,080
Was that one of the names for Warrior Cat,

770
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,760
or is that a private, personal, maybe sexy message?

771
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
It's not that sexy.

772
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,280
Participated in something private and personal and sexy.

773
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
Well, they made me do it.

774
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
I can't feel guilty about,

775
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,680
like they left their bedroom door open, you know?

776
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,040
And they played soothing music inside.

777
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
What am I supposed to do?

778
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,040
What am I supposed to do?

779
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,760
This message says it's for the week of November 12th.

780
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,080
Oh my God, we did it.

781
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,960
That's a third.

782
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,840
First off, we did it.

783
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
Secondly, that's a Thursday.

784
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,200
What are you doing?

785
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,800
How are you splitting up your weeks?

786
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,440
Thursday's a special day of the week.

787
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm, I'm, I don't want to,

788
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,400
I feel gross actually talking about this,

789
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,480
this bedroom situation anymore.

790
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,560
Griffin, tell us more about what Cupcake and Muffin

791
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,000
do on Thursdays.

792
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,080
They get stale because they were baked on a Monday.

793
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,320
I got a message for James from Will.

794
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,040
Hey big bro, here's wishing you a happy big 29 from me,

795
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,840
the guy that always beat you at Settlers of Catan.

796
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,520
I hope the final year of your 20s is filled with fun, laughter,

797
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
and gunny?

798
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't know what that means.

799
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,640
Oh man.

800
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
I bet it's dirty too.

801
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,680
Probably not dirty.

802
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,000
Probably not.

803
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
It probably is dirty.

804
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,480
Sorry, sorry for eating your cherry flapjack.

805
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,960
My bad.

806
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
That is a true crime.

807
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't, I would love, I would just adore.

808
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,240
I would just really fancy a cherry flapjack right now.

809
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,680
That goes down really good.

810
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,520
You know what I would kill for right now?

811
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,560
What?

812
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,760
Some, some motherfucking corn on the cob.

813
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,000
Right?

814
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,480
I want to kill, corn on the cob is basically

815
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,120
a Japanese capsule hotel for corn.

816
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,320
And I want to get in there like, like Bahamut

817
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,840
and just destroy the whole foundation of the thing.

818
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,200
You know what I mean?

819
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,960
I do.

820
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
I really do.

821
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,640
I want to get that sloppy corn butter chin that you can only get

822
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,680
from a true full blown cob devastator.

823
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
I'd also like a corn fritter.

824
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah, whatever.

825
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,840
Oh, do you guys ever do, so welcome to Corncast.

826
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,560
Did you guys realize why this episode is not one of our best?

827
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,440
I just realized it.

828
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,640
Friday the 13th.

829
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
It's, we've been cursed.

830
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
It's our first ever Friday the 13th recording, I think.

831
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
Well, um, boo.

832
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Um, I'm Jason.

833
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Hey everyone, we're the Flophouse.

834
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,800
One of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

835
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm Dan McCoy.

836
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm Stuart Wellington.

837
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

838
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,080
What is the Flophouse?

839
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
You may very well ask.

840
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,760
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

841
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
A bad movie podcast?

842
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,600
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

843
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,280
I'd answer that by saying one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

844
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

845
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,920
And two, shut up.

846
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,040
Sick bird.

847
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,760
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

848
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

849
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,880
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

850
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,840
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie

851
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,000
or discussions about sex tarps.

852
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,520
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

853
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,600
and talking about ding dongs.

854
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,640
That's mostly used to.

855
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,520
Wait, what?

856
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,200

858
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,720
The Flophouse.

859
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,840
That's what happens now.

860
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
You read a question.

861
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,440
Okay, all right.

862
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,120
Kind of pump the brakes there.

863
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,240
You asked.

864
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,360
I currently work as the graphic and web designer for a small company

865
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,600
and the nature of my work requires to bring me...

866
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,820
Fuck.

867
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
Friday the 13th.

868
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,560
Got me again.

869
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,120
Again.

870
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
Oh, those tricky...

871
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,200
Jason.

872
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
Those tricky Jasons.

873
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,680
They sneak in and they make it twist your words.

874
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,920
It requires me to bring my laptop into the office.

875
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,000
I love the job except for the fact

876
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,960
my very hands-on boss keeps poking and touching my screen.

877
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Oftentimes hard enough to make me worry about the safety of my computer.

878
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,280
Is there a way for me to get him to stop it

879
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,440
and to keep my job that's from smudgy screen in SoCal?

880
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm sorry.

881
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Now, Griffin, why is this tickled you so much?

882
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,960
It tickled me.

883
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
Imagine it.

884
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
Imagine it.

885
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,600
Oh, let me see.

886
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,560
What are you working on here?

887
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Jab, jab, jab.

888
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,040
Jab, jab, squeeze.

889
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,800
Oh, I like this graph here and I like how it goes up.

890
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,360
What have you done?

891
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,240
Oh, you've done a bar graph with a bar here, here, here.

892
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, yeah.

893
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,840
Hey, what does this button do?

894
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Do you want some of my PB&J?

895
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,200
No?

896
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,520
All right.

897
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,240
All right.

898
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,720
More for me.

899
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,120
What is this new search engine you're using?

900
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,960
Splorch, splorch, splorch.

901
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
Like, what is this guy's deal?

902
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,400
It's called splorch.com.

903
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,200
Hey, can we get that?

904
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,480
Can we get splorch.com?

905
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,440
You already did.

906
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,920
Damn it.

907
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I have one foolproof plan that is going to keep your bosses going to fall for it once,

908
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
and then your problems will be over.

909
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,760
Put some jelly on.

910
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,880
Yeah, I figured that might be-

911
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,000
You put some jelly right on your computer and the boss goes in for a touch of whiskey

912
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and he comes back with a finger full of strawberry preserves,

913
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,320
I guarantee your problems are going to be whisked away like you're on a carnival cruise

914
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,640
line sailing off to the Bahamas.

915
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,720
Now, Justin, I'm sorry, but how does that stop the screen from getting smudgy and dirty

916
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,960
when it's covered in preserves?

917
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,000
Now listen, because now you got ants, but the-

918
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,520
And those helpful ants are going to clean that screen right off.

919
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,720
They won't leave a fleck of jam on there.

920
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,280
Hey, is this the IT department?

921
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,920
Yeah.

922
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,160
Is it normal for my computer to have some bugs?

923
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,760
Yeah, it is.

924
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Just break down and fix it.

925
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,600
Fuck yeah.

926
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,520
Oh, you nerds, I recorded that.

927
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,400
Now, nobody can get me fired for this now.

928
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,120
Have you seen that hot new viral video Guy Punk's IT department with bug pun?

929
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,720
It's got four views.

930
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,560
It's pretty sick.

931
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
You guys want a Yahoo?

932
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,560
That didn't really answer the question, Jelly.

933
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,520
Well, it's just the craziest thing I've probably ever heard.

934
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Why is this man touching your screen so much?

935
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,320
Does he know there's little LCD diodes in there?

936
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,320
They don't like being touched.

937
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,120
Give them their space.

938
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,120
Ask him not to.

939
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,720
Just ask him not.

940
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:39,600
Or maybe, is there a way you can make him feel like good about himself while asking him to stop?

941
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Like, whoa, Hercules.

942
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You're gonna break my liquid crystals with your big muscles there.

943
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,680
You better pump the brakes.

944
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,480
I have an idea.

945
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,120
Here's what you do.

946
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,680
Have ready, right, a little bottle of spray and like a screen cleaning wipe, right?

947
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,680
And when you see him coming, start cleaning your screen.

948
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
And when he walks up, you look at him and say,

949
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,560
just trying to keep my screen clean.

950
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,720
And then you're done, and he's there, and he's just seeing you trying to clean it, right?

951
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,560
I think that that will be enough to keep his fingers off of your screen.

952
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,840
Unless he's like, oh, you got rid of my good oily work that I did on my last-

953
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
I drew a line for you to follow.

954
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,560
Don't you understand?

955
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,680
I said I wanted the line graph to go like here up to here.

956
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,840
Stop, stop erasing it.

957
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,520
Hey, stop cleaning your screen or you're fucking fired.

958
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,480
You're a dime a dozen.

959
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,920
Let my grease do the work.

960
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,440
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

961
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,640
Yes.

962
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,600
Yeah, absolutely.

963
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,840
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000 Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport.

964
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,320
Thank you, Drew.

965
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,680
It's by an anonymous user.

966
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,120
I'm gonna call him Big Joan because Big Joan is the only person that has answered this anonymous user.

967
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,080
Big Joan asks-

968
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,800
Perfect.

969
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,360
What is Lizard Man's relationship to this human world?

970
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,040
What does it mean if you are a Lizard Man in a former life?

971
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,720
What?

972
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,480
Okay, what- Griffin, what- what in there is capitalized?

973
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,520
You think that's gonna help?

974
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,000
Syntax?

975
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,560
I don't know.

976
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,240
I'm looking for any clues.

977
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
W, the W in what?

978
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,400
That's it.

979
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,880
Proper.

980
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Lizard Man's not, former life's not?

981
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,220
No.

982
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,800
God damn it.

983
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
What is-

984
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,760
Lizard Man's relationship-

985
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,240
One more time.

986
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,400
What is Lizard Man's relationship to this human world?

987
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,880
God damn it.

988
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
God, do you think this is Lizard Man asking that?

989
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
Oh, that's grim.

990
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,280
Poor Lizard Man.

991
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
He's having a rough ride on the 13th too, huh?

992
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,640
What am Lizard Man doing in this human world?

993
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Why can't Lizard Man find love?

994
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,600
Lizard Man keeps saying wrong words on podcast.

995
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,000
Lizard Man am bad at recorded medium.

996
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,040
Podcast no be viral hit that Lizard Man expects to be.

997
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,240
Lizard Man have unique thoughts and opinions that Lizard Man thought would get chuckle from others.

998
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,680
Plain fleshy human ears no interested in hearing Lizard Man's unique perspective.

999
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,200
Lizard Man have small but deep audience.

1000
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Lizard Man thought audience would be more permissive of audio issues early on.

1001
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,320
Lizard Man can't get hashtag going.

1002
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,440
Why no one use hashtag for Lizard Man's show?

1003
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,240
Lizard Man's special guest appearance by Adam Carolla fall through last minute.

1004
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
Lizard Man mourn for opportunities lost.

1005
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,520
Lizard Man's sponsor's very disappointed in Lizard Man.

1006
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,600
Lizard Man know how sponsors.

1007
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,440
Lizard Man sorry about lies.

1008
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,120
Lizard Man sorry about lies.

1009
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,120
Oh god.

1010
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,600
Could be Lizard Man's inconsistent release schedule?

1011
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,040
Potentially.

1012
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,720
Potentially.

1013
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,760
It's all about consistency.

1014
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,800
That's why we're recording fucking today instead of skipping a week.

1015
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,760
Even though we're recording on the spookiest unluckiest day of the year.

1016
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,240
In hindsight, Lizard Man should not have called his podcast This American Life 2.

1017
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,640
The Lizard Man story.

1018
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,840
The Lizard Man story.

1019
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,120
The Lizard Man should have called this show for Lizard Man only.

1020
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,640
Such a narrow audience.

1021
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,120
Just me.

1022
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,080
Would also include Lizard Women if could find any.

1023
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,800
It's so hard out there.

1024
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,120
It's so hard out there for a Lizard Man.

1025
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,800
Ah man.

1026
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,640
Um what uh what uh what would you guys say to uh another question?

1027
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,440
How would that grab you?

1028
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
How would Lizard Man feel about that?

1029
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,280
It would grab me good.

1030
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,640
Lizard Man like questions.

1031
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,840
I'm 33 years old and my parents don't know that I have tattoos.

1032
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,760
I used to have a negative relationship with them.

1033
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,560
Yeah.

1034
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,240
I used to have a negative relationship with them.

1035
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,440
So when I started getting tattoos at the age of 18 I kept it a secret.

1036
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
By now we have worked on things and have a good relationship.

1037
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,200
But I've been lying to them for 15 years now about the fact that I have tattoos.

1038
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
I want to get more in places that'll be harder to keep hidden.

1039
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,920
How do I let my family know I have tattoos?

1040
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,680
I already know they have a problem with them in general for religious reasons.

1041
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
That's from Girl With The Secret Tattoos.

1042
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,760
Um I the one thing that struck me about this is odd is the line um uh I've been lying to

1043
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,480
them for 15 years now about the fact that I have tattoos.

1044
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,400
You think that's a lie about a mission?

1045
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,760
Not like she goes out of her way to say she doesn't go out of her way to say I uh anybody

1046
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,960
got any tattoos in this room?

1047
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,600
Not me.

1048
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,400
No me neither.

1049
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,880
No absolutely not you.

1050
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,240
Every time she shows up for Thanksgiving you don't have any tattoos do you?

1051
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,120
No still don't.

1052
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,440
Everything's cool where's the stuffing?

1053
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,640
But she she has missed by my math 15 consecutive Labor Day pool parties.

1054
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,920
Oh that's a good point.

1055
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,640
There's a lot of reasons why you're you're tattooed.

1056
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,520
What if it's her face?

1057
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,960
What if she's got the face tattoos?

1058
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,520
Well she says she wants to get them in places that are uh harder to conceal so I I can't

1059
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,840
think of many more places that are harder than that.

1060
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,080
I can't convince my family I'm just a huge fan of fan of the opera for much longer.

1061
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:11,760
Or I could you could you maybe try this your parents are like hey is that a Taz tattoo

1062
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,240
on your back?

1063
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,760
And you just like spin around and like whoa how'd that get there?

1064
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,000
What the hell I I've been targeted by a tattoo you know.

1065
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,440
They got me again.

1066
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,320
They got me again.

1067
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,320
What if you just acted like you had already told them?

1068
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
I told you about my Taz tattoo.

1069
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,560
Yeah you guys you've known about I I told you about it remember?

1070
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,640
Yeah it was like eight years ago.

1071
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,440
Did you forget?

1072
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:37,840
Remember?

1073
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,520
And now ball's in the air court.

1074
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,800
I was originally gonna get one with him uh like doing his like twirl and he was gonna

1075
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,360
say like the world keeps on spinning baby or like Taz say the world keeps on spinning

1076
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,840
baby or something and and I just got the smaller one.

1077
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,200
I told you guys that we had the whole conversation.

1078
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,840
You remember.

1079
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,120
Because you said you were gonna get one too and then uh you didn't.

1080
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,800
We went and you chickened out at the last minute and then you got one later and you

1081
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,600
got it removed.

1082
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,640
How do you not remember this?

1083
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,760
You remember.

1084
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,320
What if you got Taz praying?

1085
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,360
That would be amazing probably.

1086
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,160
And so then they were like a tattoo and you're like yeah but look closer and they're like

1087
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,720
oh okay.

1088
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,000
No that's kind of nice.

1089
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,560
That's nice and they got another one of Taz peeing on something like that Calvin kid.

1090
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,640
Yeah he's peeing on the devil.

1091
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,040
Yeah you guys uh remember when Taz was like big for a minute right?

1092
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah.

1093
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,160
I was thinking I was thinking about this yesterday.

1094
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,800
Do you think that was you also remember the when Tweety Bird was kind of like in vogue

1095
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,360
right?

1096
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,960
Like a little bit before that.

1097
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,200
Do you all because I was trying to puzzle out why anybody would have any affinity for

1098
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,040
Taz the character the Tasmanian devil and I started to wonder do you think people who

1099
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,680
were super into Taz initially were doing it sort of like a rebellious flipping of the

1100
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,760
proverbial bird to people who are really into Tweety?

1101
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,440
Like that's not for me.

1102
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,480
I'm a grown adult with I'm a bad girl or boy uh I'm a I'm more of a Taz person myself.

1103
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,880
Tweety Tweety has no sway over me.

1104
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
Um yes?

1105
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,160
You're saying there were warring factions of Tweety and Taz.

1106
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,080
I'm saying that the original Taz's I'm wondering I'm not pausing this theory I'm

1107
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:34,800
wondering aloud if the original Taz's were seen by their users as like a uh a rebellion

1108
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,600
an act of rebellion an anti-establishment uh uh sort of symbol.

1109
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,520
But could you not flip that Justin and say that the Tweety Bird came out of people seeing

1110
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,160
the Taz and saying no I believe in a more structured society in which the good guy who

1111
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,200
wins and they're a little bit a little bit a little bit rambunctious but mostly there

1112
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,880
for good.

1113
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,000
Um okay that you would say I would say Taz is I would say Taz is chaotic good and well

1114
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,400
Justin I would say it depends on which Taz they're talking about.

1115
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,880
Are we talking about the Taz from like tiny tunes and later iterations or are we talking

1116
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
about the original Taz because the original Taz was the bad guy if I remember correctly.

1117
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:25,040
I got a monstrously explicit Marvin the Martian tattoo over my body it's a full body extremely

1118
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,400
explicit Marvin the Martian tattoo and when I say extremely explicit I'm talking about

1119
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:42,560
dick on dick like his on mine full-blown full tattoo suit uh-huh yeah right we I remember

1120
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,880
last Christmas as well as anybody what the what else do you have to add nothing that

1121
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,360
was a great gift that you all got for me that you all chipped in it's a very expensive

1122
00:48:51,360 --> 00:49:00,000
procedure getting a full martian body transplant but uh it was worth it that was him of course

1123
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,760
that was a classic character an impersonation of his favorite character Marvin the Martian

1124
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
yeah I actually you know what's fucked I'm kind of over him now a little bit that's

1125
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,120
too bad that's that's a shame you hate to hear that everybody this has been my brother

1126
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,640

1128
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:33,760
our lives really hard as a result and it was very selfish sorry everybody that's very good
