1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Hey everybody, it's my brother, my brother and me. Welcome to the show. It's going to be a big

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
show. We got a lot of jokes for you this week. A lot of you writing in with problems and queries

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,000
and problems and we got the solutions for you. First question, how a lot of noise can you make,

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
Justin? Well, question asked. That's a good question. Here's the noise.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,480
That's actually, that's actually healing me. That's soothing.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,520
That's not only sonically unpleasant for me, probably our listeners as well.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I went to sleep at 11 o'clock last night and I feel great.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I stayed out drinking a lot at a bachelor party,

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,760
went to bed at like three o'clock in the morning, then woke up at seven o'clock in the morning and

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,040
drove five hours to get back to Cincinnati. I mean, mine's not as good. I'm Griffin McElroy,

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm the baby brother. I just, I just drank a whole bunch. I didn't, there's not like a whole

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,880
production. There wasn't a traveling element to my story. It's just, I drank all day.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,680
Actually, here's, here's what I actually did. I went to a, uh, I went to a ramp dinner last night.

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,160
You guys familiar with ramps? Apparently in West Virginia. So you do sweet stunts. You jump your

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,680
bikes off of my Travis Estrana. No sweet stunts. It's a West Virginia delicacy. Uh, uh, oh, onions.

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh yeah. Yeah. Sort of a, it's in the garlic, garlic family. Uh, it tastes a little bit like

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
greens, like very garlicky greens, but you have a whole big party around them. Our friends,

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Kimberly and Mike has out there, they have chickens and goats that they actually get the eggs

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,600
from. We bought some eggs from them. From goats? They have goat eggs? We bought goat eggs from

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,480
them. They cost a hundred million dollars because they don't exist. No, we buy chicken eggs from a

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,960
person that we know is still just a little, you're still just a little too up. Just like down just

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,960
like a few steps. We've done this show hungover before. Have we done two people? No. Hungover?

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,880
This is the most hungover the show's ever been. If I needed to bring myself down a little bit,

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,280
I can just think about how excited I am about buying eggs from someone I know. That's like

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,240
where my life's at. That's pretty sad. It is a little bit. Okay. Yep. There it is. Okay. It's

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,360
sure as shit ain't happy. Bringing me down. Bringing me on down. I woke up this morning

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,880
with diarrhea and a nose bleed. Like I don't think I should drink. Wait, hold on. To be fair,

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,160
coming out of the appropriate holes. Yes. That is my favorite Hank Williams senior album. I don't

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,480
think I should drink anymore. I don't think I should. I don't think my body is, is my body is

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,480
no longer capable of taking my life essence on credit in the way that you do when you get super

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,240
drunk and you know that tomorrow is going to suck. I, the exchange, the fucking APR on that deal is

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,760
dog shit. The ROI on that particular transaction. I also know that there is nothing I could do in

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,480
the future to balance that out. Like I couldn't be super drunk one night and like incredibly sober

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,520
the other night. Like I can't go past zero. What was your, uh, what was your beverage of choice?

39
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Griffin? Oh, it was, uh, oh, it was maybe you've heard of it. Coors light. I got a lot of beef from

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:06,960
my so-called friends. I got, I have to revisit the terminology now because all I called it was Coors

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,800
and that's apparently not what you're supposed to call it. Yeah. It's not Coors. There's two

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:21,120
fucking Os in there. Coors. Coors. Coors. When you say it like that, when you say it like that,

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,240
it doesn't sound like bathwater. Coors is for cool people. That is that great failed campaign

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:39,360
from the sixties. Hello, I'm Yul Brynner. Coors is for cool people. Coors is not. Unfortunately,

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
I've just been alerted by the producer. This commercial has been canceled. Whoops. I didn't

46
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,720
even know that happened. Coors is on the stun. Okay, I'll stop. Let's, uh, let's just hurry.

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,520
Let's help someone else because you guys can't help yourselves. This question comes to us from

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,920
Jacques Huit in Chicago. I handle all the UPS packages at my office. The man who delivers them

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,240
is a super nice guy. We're always sharing anecdotes and jokes. He's a great mini break

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,320
in the middle of the workday. Problem is, I don't know his name. It's been over a year since I've

51
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,840
started this position and I don't know how to ask without it being awkward. Suggestions? I have a

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:33,760
suggestion. Don't worry about it. Okay. We said we got to fucking move it a clip so I can.

53
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
The reason I say don't worry about it is he's never going to quiz you on it. It's never going

54
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,880
to come up. Like we have a male dude that rolls up to since he shakes every Tuesday during staff

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,640
meeting and we applaud for him every time because he usually brings us checks and that is nice.

56
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,520
And like, I don't know his name and I'm also going to be honest with you. I don't care. He's

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
the male guy that I clap for. We have our exchange. He goes away. It's great. I also think he thinks

58
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,120
we're all assholes because I think he thinks we're applauding like ironically. And in fact, you are

59
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:16,480
applauding sincerely. Because you're theater jerks. But I don't know a way to clap. I don't

60
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,600
know two types. I don't know a way to clap and simultaneously say, but I mean it. There's no way

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,040
to not clap ironically anymore. It's 2013. Every clap is ironic. There's a great method you can

62
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,200
use here that I have used before is to introduce yourself. Go with this. I don't know if I've

63
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,120
introduced myself before. My name is Jeffrey and he'll be like, oh, my name is UPS. It will be so

64
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,080
weird. You're going to wonder how you didn't catch that before when his name turns out. My name is

65
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,520
Eustace Paul Stevenson. His name is just ups. What's up? I'm big ups. They call me down at

66
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,000
the factory. It's not a nickname. My parents are drunks. I think, though, if you do that,

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
maybe if you got to start off with something like, you know, you come in every day and I don't,

68
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
you know, and we've never been properly introduced. I don't think you could say,

69
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,520
I don't believe we've been introduced because that makes it seem like you forgot that.

70
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,520
He also knows how bad it is to be in this situation. He also doesn't like that you

71
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,120
don't know his name. I'm assuming Jacquie is wearing a nametag of some sort.

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
Or that she fucking signs for packages.

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,600
Signs for packages. Yeah. Okay. Ask him to sign for this one.

74
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,440
That's a fun game.

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,120
Say, can you maybe sign for this one with your name? Are you wanting to know because like for

76
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,440
flirting or just like, but she's trying to dip her pen and come. Well, she. Okay. Hold on. Her.

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
She has the ink. You got to start the metaphor over. She wants to spill her ink.

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,040
She wants to have her company inkwell dipped in by his cock. Wait.

79
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
We'll get it back. She wants to have sex with it. They want to have sex together.

80
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
You don't know that's not true.

81
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,160
Well, why else would she want to know his name? There are myriad reasons.

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
Name one that doesn't involve them fucking. Christmas card.

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Yeah. Like you're going to give a Christmas card to UPS man. Next.

84
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,400
I'm writing a check for you for Christmas, for your Christmas bonus.

85
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Nobody has ever done that. That's like old wives tale.

86
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, and also nobody bonuses a UPS dude.

87
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah. Well, they bonus them in the sense that they fucking bones them.

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,920
They bones them.

89
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Why are you so sex obsessed? I'm trying to trying to keep this show clean.

90
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,680
Yeah. Griffin gets that Coors up in me.

91
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,000
I've got fucking, uh, I turned into a mountain. It's like,

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
it's like drinking the mountains frost and it just gets so ribald.

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
You guys. Okay. So you guys tip your mailman obviously.

94
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Never. No. Okay.

95
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,200
Have never garbage man. No. I, I left a nice dresser on the French too.

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
I don't think I think they think that is a chore actually.

97
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
I know no one tips me. Why doesn't anybody tip me?

98
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,480
Yeah. I think you're, you're supposed to tip wives for people in,

99
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
in like service industries. But here's the thing in this damn age,

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
I don't even know that we have the same dude every day.

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,200
I got her except for UPS. Like I know that the UPS lady at, uh,

102
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,720
since he shakes is the same woman every week, she has very distinctive hairstyle

103
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,520
and she's hard to miss. And so I know that she's the same one.

104
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,640
It's not the uniform. Well, no, I'm saying that like,

105
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,800
I don't confuse her with other UPS people. I'm with you. I'm with you.

106
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
But like, as far as like my first of all, I never see my garbage,

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,240
our garbage men. They're like a mystery to me.

108
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,640
I, but see, here's my thing. I get pretty, I get pretty buckwild with the things

109
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,440
that I leave to be thrown away that have not been like properly bagged or anything.

110
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
So I, for me, it, a lot of it is dealing with residual guilt.

111
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,920
I'll leave like just, just stacks of cardboard boxes everywhere.

112
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,840
Or like my Amazon. Do you tear them down though?

113
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
What? No, I don't tear them down. I tip it.

114
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,240
You just like build a fort out there and like hang a sign that says like your job.

115
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,320
It's not that far off. Last, last week I left a cardboard box full of broken glass

116
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,680
that I wrote broken glass on. Then you just, no Justin, you went,

117
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,880
you went above and beyond there. You went above and beyond.

118
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
You, you gave him fair warning that, Hey, don't stick your paw in here.

119
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
You big angry bear. Dirty syringes.

120
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't think they root for, I hope not at least.

121
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,120
Have you not seen the Emilio SOS Charlie Sheen movie? That's all they do.

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
They root for trash. What movie?

123
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Oh God. Is it called like minute work? I believe.

124
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,400
But yeah, basically they're garbage men that end up getting caught up in some kind of

125
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,680
a political scandal. But at the beginning of the movie,

126
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
there's like going through people's trash and finding naked pictures of people.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
It's a really weird movie. I'm glad they could work together though

128
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
on something. That must have been exciting.

129
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,240
That's what this podcast, it's my brother, my brother and me of Emilio Estevez movies.

130
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
You guys want a Yahoo? Please.

131
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
Have we been doing this for an hour yet?

132
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,600
It was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

133
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
It's by Yahoo answers user Yasser, who asks,

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
building a terminator. Experts only.

135
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
If you are a troll or stupid, then get the hell out of this question. Experts only.

136
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
The entire internet vacates the room. Bye.

137
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,920
Later. Hello?

138
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Hello? Operator? Operator?

139
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
Let me just refresh them. Nope, still no users.

140
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,160
I've decided I want to build a terminator T800 and I need some help how to make this happen.

141
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
First things first, where can I get the parts for it?

142
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Is there any sites where they sell body parts for any models of terminators?

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,400
Second question, where can I get the schematic for a terminator?

144
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,600
I would be very thankful for the one that gives me the right info and I will reward you with 10 points.

145
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,980
Whoa.

146
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,420
Whoa. That sounds good.

147
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,460
That's an exchange rate that is, I don't know what Yahoo points are used for.

148
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,580
That is, yeah, I don't know what the conversion is.

149
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,260
I feel like I am owed roughly 3 billion Yahoo points for all the work we've done.

150
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,580
I think this person is putting the cart before the horse a little bit in asking where they can

151
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,380
get parts and then asking how to get schematics.

152
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,820
I also want to say that I feel like it's a little cut corner to be like,

153
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,380
I want to build a terminator. Also, where can I get pre-built body parts for it?

154
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,780
It's like, hey man, if you're not going to do it from scratch, then what's the point?

155
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,980
Well, maybe they lack the tools for this particular fabrication.

156
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,180
Seriously, they want a snap together model. You know what I mean? They don't want to carve it.

157
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,300
Like K'nex. You remember K'nex? He wants that, but it builds a future robot.

158
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,620
You could probably build a terminator out of K'nex,

159
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,380
but all he would be able to do is lift a ball to the top of a roller coaster.

160
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah, which in and of itself would be pretty baller.

161
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,340
But I guess then you couldn't really define him as a terminator

162
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,460
because he would not in fact be terminating anything.

163
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,340
Except for your boredom.

164
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,900
What if when the ball makes it to the top of the thing, a big laser comes out of his head

165
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,420
and kills people? I haven't seen the Terminator movies.

166
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,940
I've never seen the Terminator movies.

167
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,140
I swear to God, I haven't.

168
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,420
You've not seen any of them?

169
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,860
None, no. I watched half of the first one and like only two people got killed and I was like, bored.

170
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,140
I watched the animated Saturday morning cartoon version.

171
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,660
Okay, let me tell you guys the story of the Terminator. I will start from the beginning.

172
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:05,940
Sarah and her son, John, Sarah Connor is pregnant with a baby.

173
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,020
And Arnold Schwarzenegger is a robot, a series 800 Terminator.

174
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,980
Is he the dad?

175
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,220
What? No.

176
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,140
Sorry, is he the dad?

177
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,420
No, he's a robot.

178
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,780
So, robots can't... Sorry to keep interrupting you, Justin.

179
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,580
Sorry, for the bit.

180
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,700
Is the baby half robot?

181
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,820
Well, I've seen Bicentennial Man.

182
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,460
And robots can come and they can create babies just like a normal person.

183
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Okay, let me start again and this time I will replace the Terminator

184
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,340
with Robin Williams' robotic character from Bicentennial Man.

185
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,180
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

186
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:55,540
Okay, so Bicentennial Man, as portrayed by Robin Williams, travels, is in a war,

187
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,420
in our future, is in a war with humanity.

188
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,660
Okay.

189
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,100
Robots versus humans, right?

190
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,060
Does he have his skin and stuff yet or is he still like the creepy servo-bot?

191
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,900
At this point, he has skin.

192
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,460
Okay, so we're close to the end of the movie.

193
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,100
We're close to the end of the movie, it's in our future,

194
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,820
but he's about to go to the beginning of the movie, which is our past.

195
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,980
Okay, back when he didn't have, when he was just metal.

196
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,580
John Connor is leading humanity's revolt against robots.

197
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,700
Is this the baby?

198
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,820
The baby is doing this?

199
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,460
Yes, yes.

200
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,380
A baby from inside the womb?

201
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,220
Fully grown John Connor is leading humanity's revolt against the robots, okay?

202
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,380
So the robots are like, this is going bad.

203
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,140
I don't think we're gonna win this one.

204
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,900
And they're like, well, let's give up.

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,460
First off.

206
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,020
Well, this is the thing.

207
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,780
The robots never give up, okay?

208
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,340
But here's the thing, I don't see the robots sitting around a table like,

209
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,700
listen guys, we're blowing it.

210
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,100
Listen guys, I put a lot of thought into this.

211
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Listen, we had a good run.

212
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,820
In my gut.

213
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
This is what happens.

214
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,340
So listen, so they make a bunch of robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

215
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,460
And now Arnold Schwarzenegger is a T-800, but he's the 101 model.

216
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,740
So like his series is like his robotic abilities,

217
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,900
and that 101 refers to like his flesh covering,

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,420
which all look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

219
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,460
So they sent him back in the past to kill John Connor's mom,

220
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
which seems harsh.

221
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,940
It seems harsh.

222
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,060
T2, Terminator 2.

223
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,820
And that's the end of the movie?

224
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,340
They send him back and say, good luck?

225
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,740
And the movie is like, thanks, I'll do what I can.

226
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:41,140
And so then, okay, so then T2, they try it again with a robot made of liquid.

227
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,260
But by this point, the humans have their own Arnold Schwarzenegger,

228
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,660
and they send him back to protect him from that.

229
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,500
And that's John Connor's dad.

230
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,660
That's debatable.

231
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,020
Is John Connor's his own dad?

232
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,860
Oh shit, he's his own dad.

233
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:06,340
I saw the scene in the original T1 where Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to that woman's door

234
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,020
and is like, are you Sarah Connor?

235
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,180
And she was like, yes.

236
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,580
And he's like, all right, let me take out my chewing gum.

237
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,060
She was like-

238
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,660
I said, are you Sarah Connor?

239
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Yes, I am.

240
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,660
And then he's like, oh, sorry, are you the Sarah Connor that specifically,

241
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,060
the one that has a baby and the baby,

242
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:33,860
and are you pregnant right now with a baby that just feels like a few apocalyptic leader of men?

243
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,220
And she's like, no, that's not, I'm like 60 years old.

244
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,420
I've clearly had menopause already, it's clearly not me.

245
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,420
And he's like, okay, I apologize for the mistake, have a nice day.

246
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:52,020
I love the tasteful, the hedges in your yard, they're good.

247
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,940
While I'm here, do you know any other Sarah Connors that may be-

248
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,020
Do you have like a daughter you named after yourself?

249
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,660
Do you have a, did you name a daughter after yourself?

250
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,100
By the way, I have good news about Robot Jesus.

251
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,300
He's a new Jesus that will-

252
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,740
I'm just gonna leave some pamphlets.

253
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,900
In a hundred years or so, it's really gonna, it's just sweep the nation.

254
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,020
You could get on board super early with Robot Jesus.

255
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,580
I could leave you a few excerpts from the cyber.

256
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,660
That's a cyber Bible that Robot Jesus wrote for you from the future.

257
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,140
No, okay.

258
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,740
Just thought I'd try.

259
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm gonna go.

260
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,660
His oil will wash your heart clean if you want that.

261
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,740
That was a fucking super, super good impression we all did together.

262
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,940
We all did increasingly good impressions.

263
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,540
If we had a fourth brother, he would be indistinguishable from Arnold Schwarzenegger

264
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,020
because of diminishing returns and statistics.

265
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,100
You know, a lot of people don't know this, but doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression

266
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,140
is really easy.

267
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,460
Just lower your voice slightly and mumble.

268
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,580
And apparently-

269
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,540
The only hard part is fighting the temptation to say,

270
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,020
anybody wanna pee their pants out?

271
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,740
Definitely.

272
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,780
It is your same-

273
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,980
I just have an impression of a big man.

274
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,980
And then I bust it out.

275
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,660
That is also my Hall Hogan.

276
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,020
Do your Jesse Ventura.

277
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,980
Hello, I'm also a governor.

278
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,620
It's hard because it's also really close to my impression I'm an adult.

279
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,780
Like what an adult sounds like.

280
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,180
All grownups to me sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

281
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,740
So Griff, just side note.

282
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,740
We make like a bunch of loud noise so it's easier to find the edit mark for when you cut out

283
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,300
that giant section where we talk about Terminator.

284
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Nah.

285
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,740
No, we'll just move on.

286
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,820
My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and a half,

287
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,260
yet somehow in all this time we've never had, quote, a song.

288
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,300
We like a lot of the same music and there are several songs that fill me with warm fuzzies

289
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,660
because they remind me of him.

290
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,500
But it seems a little gauche to pick one and declare this will be our song.

291
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,220
How do normal humans pick their song?

292
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,220
Where can we find one?

293
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,540
Not knowing anything about our relationship,

294
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,220
do you have any suggestions?

295
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,140
Romantic Rhapsody in the Rockies.

296
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,340
The only people that do that are like 12.

297
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,460
Rachel and I do not.

298
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,660
We do not know like what our first dance song is going to be.

299
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300
Yeah, that's the thing.

300
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,380
Teresa and I, we had never really contemplated it until the first dance question came up.

301
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,820
We're going to go with Nice and White Satin by the Moody Blues.

302
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,860
It's a good one.

303
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,300
Yeah, but I mean, that's more of like that's because that's her favorite band

304
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,620
and it's like a really appropriate first dance song.

305
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,220
And it's hard because I already found the best one ever.

306
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,780
So it's like, look, you know, how do you top?

307
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,540
Yeah, it's we're all Travis and I are basically fighting for second now.

308
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,220
Yeah, it's all just a battle for second.

309
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,380
I wish that picking a song for a couple was like it was just randomly assigned.

310
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,980
It had nothing to do with like your emotional connection to the song or anything.

311
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,460
You think you should get out of like a Zoltan machine?

312
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah.

313
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,660
Carnival.

314
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,300
Like if you like your song is Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen and you're like, but why?

315
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,180
I you know what?

316
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,860
We did have our first dance to Lurol's Stay Awhile with me, but I think other songs have

317
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,700
probably become more emblematic of our like I think they would that we identify with them

318
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,540
more as a couple over time.

319
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,900
I think that you're you're probably there's nothing that says that you're going to find

320
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,700
your song that early because I think that part of your song is that it represents a

321
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,980
lot of what your relationship is about.

322
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,060
And I think it takes a while for you to understand what your what your dynamic is.

323
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,340
And you know, I also think a lot of songs may interrupt Justin.

324
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,500
Sure.

325
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,180
The problem with that and the problem with this question in general.

326
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,300
May I interrupt?

327
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,860
Yes.

328
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,100
Okay.

329
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,900
Oh, you did double back.

330
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,420
What I did there is I've reversed.

331
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,620
That's a reversing.

332
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,300
You did a reverse reverse.

333
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,660
Oh, that could be that could be your slide could be your song.

334
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,460
Maybe this is our song.

335
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,100
Oh, fuck.

336
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,220
That would be the fucking best first dance wedding song ever is like the fucking Cupid

337
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,820
Shuffle comes on and you and your new significant your new life partner are like fucking start

338
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,940
doing it and other people get up.

339
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,020
You're like, what are you doing down?

340
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,820
This is our day.

341
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Nobody else can do the chicken dance, but us.

342
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,820
It's our song.

343
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,900
It's our dance.

344
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
It's let us gogm style and peace.

345
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
But that's a good choice.

346
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,500
So the issue, though, with the parameters of the question is that I think you can totally

347
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,020
have a song until you actually quantify it as this is our song.

348
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,100
And then it's like, well, now it's not anymore.

349
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,420
Why?

350
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,380
That doesn't make sense.

351
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, because suddenly it's like it's like it's like a quantum physics thing.

352
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,020
Like, as soon as it's observed, it stops being true because now it's become cliche.

353
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,340
I would argue that like the only thing that makes it your song is that observation of

354
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,140
it being your song.

355
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,900
And it is completely something that is independent of that.

356
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,260
It is actually by observation.

357
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,940
I would rather have it, though, because it's like every time this song comes on, you and

358
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,860
I sing along to it and like we know this is a thing, but we don't say it out loud.

359
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,700
I would never go to one of my friends and be like, yeah, Teresa, my song is, uh, my

360
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,020
sacrifice, take it, take it to the limit, take it to the limit.

361
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,860
I saw there's no dignity of a black street.

362
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,140
It's pretty good.

363
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:45,300
You're you are thinking about having a song as something that you would like widely report

364
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,780
to people in day to day conversation.

365
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,340
I think that whatever your song is, should be a very private discussion and maybe not

366
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,900
something you, you know, share with other people.

367
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,300
I think it's a very intimate, intimate decision.

368
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,900
But then they're going to, I mean, eventually it's going to come out, right?

369
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,300
You think you can, it's hard to keep that secret, huh?

370
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,500
And what are you going to do if you guys get married and you do have that as your first

371
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,100
dance song and you just be like, don't, we're not going to play it, but we're going to imagine

372
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,700
it and you guys will never know.

373
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,900
Could everyone leave the room, please?

374
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,700
We're going to have our first dance.

375
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:21,220
You're tying our song to our first dance song at a wedding, which is like very different

376
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,940
conversation.

377
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,340
I feel like whatever your song is can be transitional.

378
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Like I think it can evolve over time.

379
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,420
Because what if they release a song the day after you get married that is like, like,

380
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,740
what about two people and they're named Jack and Diane?

381
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,700
And like literally the day after they get married, the cougar drops Jack and Diane on

382
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,100
us and they're like, of course this is our song.

383
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,700
We grew up in the heartland and shit.

384
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,660
All that stuff, baby.

385
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,380
Can we mulligan it?

386
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,540
Guys, I'm a little, I'm actually a little worried about how the cougar, has the cougar

387
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,820
been, have you noticed John Cougar Mellencamp, like following us around because this song

388
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,340
is, is like almost biographical of our lives.

389
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,620
It is like a literal.

390
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,020
Fuck that's my exact order.

391
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,580
I heard the new John Cougar Mellencamp song.

392
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
Then I looked to my husband.

393
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,140
I said, can you believe this and it just becomes an echo as you're doing it.

394
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,940
And then it's like an R Kelly song.

395
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,620
It's like that doctor who episode.

396
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,100
John Cougar Mellencamp is taking my words.

397
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,980
He's using my voice.

398
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,540
We've got to throw John Cougar Mellencamp off the train.

399
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,900
Three brothers making a podcast together.

400
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,980
Sing about my song and they're still talking about it.

401
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,900
And he's the fourth brother.

402
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm jerking off outside one of their windows.

403
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,860
They'll never know which one, but it's Travis.

404
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,460
Oh shit.

405
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,820
Hey Travis, it's me.

406
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,220
John Nothin Mellencamp.

407
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,500
I was about to say, what are you doing here?

408
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,580
What if he just switched to Jonathan Mellencamp?

409
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:18,340
Oh, I thought you said John Nothin Mellencamp.

410
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,420
John Rest Mellencamp.

411
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,180
John Cougar Mellencamp actually drew a rest in there in the middle of his name.

412
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,460
There's a picture of the musical notation for a rest.

413
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,140
Christ.

414
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,780
Every time he says his name, you can actually hear him pronounce the beat in between.

415
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,340
Hi, I'm John Mellencamp.

416
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,060
Hi, I'm John Mellencamp.

417
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,020
He actually taps his leg twice.

418
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,500
Mellencamp.

419
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,220
Welcome to my home.

420
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,580
We want to change your name.

421
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,180
We like your songs, but we're wondering if you could change your name to Johnny Cougar.

422
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,220
Like absolutely not.

423
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,860
Absolutely no.

424
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,060
Absolutely not.

425
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,780
Listen, we've been we've been we've been working.

426
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,660
We've been workshopping your image, your brand.

427
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,500
You got to drop one of your names.

428
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,940
It's just it's just too it's just too long.

429
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,460
From now on, I will be Cougar Mellencamp.

430
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,660
We highly recommend losing Mellencamp.

431
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,140
We highly, if you're gonna lose one, I don't know.

432
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,020
I'm not really married to Cougar because it's like not what my parents fucking called me.

433
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,140
I think I might lose Cougar.

434
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,260
Ooh, I'm not.

435
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,620
Oof, not sure about that.

436
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,620
This is I'm going to say that I really like that when they split up.

437
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,220
I actually like Cougar stuff better now that he's not with John Mellencamp.

438
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,420
I know you're saying that there is an entity out there.

439
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
You're like Crosby, Stills and Nash.

440
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,500
It's a wicked knot like that.

441
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,260
Yeah, it's John Cougar and Mellencamp.

442
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,460
John Cougar and his excellent Mellencamps.

443
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:08,100
His legal name is John Cougar and he actually married a woman named Mellencamp and he's

444
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,980
super progressive.

445
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,860
It's hyphenated.

446
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,140
Yeah, John Cougar Mellencamp of the Cougar Mellencamp.

447
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,380
I'd say it's already bad enough that I worked for eight years to get my doctorate and you

448
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,820
won't let me put doctor in my name.

449
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,640
Big wigs.

450
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,300
Actually, he's a Cougar doctor.

451
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,340
He's a Cougar doctor, Dr. Cougar.

452
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,180
Why didn't he go to veterinary school?

453
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,740
If he ever drops out of music, I think he has to try to reestablish Johnny Cougar.

454
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,020
I think you have to see if you can get people to call you that in like a regular day-to-day

455
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,980
context.

456
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,940
I've been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend for a couple of years.

457
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,660
We're planning our first weekend getaway for the early summer.

458
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,540
I'm excited, but feel a bit discouraged.

459
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,700
The first time we talked about the specifics of what we want to do, we had an argument.

460
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,420
Moving forward, I want to minimize the stress of this.

461
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,900
Do you have any advice on how to prepare for this?

462
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,140
Do you have any advice on how to plan a trip with a significant other smoothly?

463
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,840
No.

464
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,700
It is always going to be a little stressful.

465
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,740
Yeah, that's the thing.

466
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm not trying to paint a yes, dear, everybody loves Raymond scenario.

467
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,260
The fact of the matter is when you get two people and everybody's going to-

468
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,460
I'm not going to let you besmirch everybody loves Raymond.

469
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
You can dump on yes, dear all you want.

470
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,620
That's fine.

471
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,020
That's great.

472
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,180
Oh, yeah, because Mike O'Malley isn't having it fucking hard enough already without having

473
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,260
Travis's buttons dog piled on him.

474
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,900
Listen, everyone but Mike O'Malley on that show was dumb.

475
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,460
Mike O'Malley was great on that show, but everybody's going to have their own agendas

476
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,660
and want to do their own stuff.

477
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,420
And it's just the way that happens, you know, from like the kind of music you're going to

478
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,780
listen to as you drive down there to like what you're going to do once you get there.

479
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,020
It's it doesn't need to be a fight.

480
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,980
It just needs to be like a compromised discussion kind of deal.

481
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,660
I'll tell you what my tip.

482
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,340
Stop giving a shit about anything other than not dying.

483
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,660
Yeah.

484
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,580
As long as you like don't get killed on the trip, who cares what you do as long as you're

485
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,140
together.

486
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,060
That's what that's what that's we don't go in with an agenda.

487
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,740
We try to avoid agendas when traveling as much as possible because that's where you'll

488
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,540
get tripped up.

489
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,900
Like that's how you get on.

490
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,580
That's how you get on the fucking case.

491
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,180
That's how you get on a case is you have an agenda.

492
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,740
If you don't have an agenda, then you can just sort of take things as they come, you

493
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,420
know, free, free in the wind.

494
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't think our dad like dad it out on too many like that issue, like dad, dad problems.

495
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,780
But one thing that he very, very much dadded was when we would go on trips and he would

496
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,460
like just get the metric for success for the trip would become this crazy thing.

497
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,740
Like if we don't find a fucking steak and shake in this goddamn Florida town where I

498
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,060
heard a rumor, I heard a rumor that there's a steak and shake and we are going to drive

499
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,340
around for two hours until we find it.

500
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,620
And that's how it'll be perfect.

501
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,900
This is actually watch dad like respond less than last two questions.

502
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,380
Oh, yeah.

503
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,260
It's like, oh, yeah.

504
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,020
He's in his own world of failure.

505
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,060
He's in his own like distinct.

506
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:10,980
We once drove around for two hours out of our way on a road trip, two hours to find

507
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
this barbecue place called Maurice's.

508
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,740
Do you guys remember this?

509
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:21,140
And it ended up being like the sauce was mustard base and it was foul.

510
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm sure there are people here listening who are like devotees of Maurice's.

511
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,340
But like we drove two hours out of this place and I would not eat a single thing on the

512
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,660
menu.

513
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,220
I think I ate like baked apples or something.

514
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,020
It was a nightmare.

515
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,060
Well, like that was not a barbecue aficionado.

516
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,300
I am not to be and I mean, I catch myself doing that, too, because like I'll get hung

517
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,100
up on some like little stupid detail like we got to be back at the hotel by five so

518
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,380
we could do this by six.

519
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,820
And it's just stupid.

520
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,740
Like it means not what I've learned.

521
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,940
If I may get savvy for a moment, what I've learned is that the difference between like

522
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,100
you going on a day trip somewhere is like an adventure, you know, hanging out versus

523
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,020
going on a trip with a significant other.

524
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,460
Really, it's to spend time with them.

525
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Everything else is just kind of secondary.

526
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,900
You know what I mean?

527
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,900
It's it's you guys going together that's important and everything else that is kind

528
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,620
of fall into place.

529
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,180
Even if you just like end up going and sitting in a hotel room for a week but enjoying each

530
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,660
other's company, that's you know, that's better than fighting about every little detail.

531
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,780
If price permits, I would suggest going to a place that is all inclusive because that

532
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,420
is basically just being on like a vacation conveyor belt.

533
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,940
It's like it's like being on like a factory line of vacation where they just put the

534
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,380
vacation stuff on you.

535
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,620
And you're in a really good position now chronologically because you can go to a place

536
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,700
without a very specific plan and just kind of yelp what you're looking for, whatever

537
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,460
you need, whatever you're in the mood for at that moment, or just ask somebody when

538
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,020
you get there.

539
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,140
You know, don't ask the concierge because you know he's getting kickbacks.

540
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,900
But you know, I think the problem you had was sitting down for a planning sesh.

541
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,700
Yeah, don't do that.

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,460
Just decide where you want to go, decide where you're going to stay, and then you know,

543
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,420
figure it out together.

544
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,460
Don't, don't, I have this saying that I came up with.

545
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,220
It's don't sweat the small stuff.

546
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,340
That's good, Justin.

547
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,660
Thanks.

548
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,900
And it's all, and the other thing is it's all small stuff.

549
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,500
That doesn't fucking make any sense.

550
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
How can you not sweat the small stuff if it's all small stuff?

551
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,060
Then it's just everything's average stuff.

552
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,580
Except for racial injustice.

553
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,780
That's the one thing.

554
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,140
You can sweat racial injustice.

555
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,420
You do have to sweat racial injustice if that should pop up during your weekend away.

556
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,340
We sat down for a planning session and just evolved into racial injustice.

557
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,500
Griffin, you got any more yahoos?

558
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,780
Oh, we should probably go to the money zone.

559
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,220
Let's get there.

560
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,740
Welcome to the money zone, everybody.

561
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,180
We've been thrown into a tizzy by Will O with this message for Ainsley.

562
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,380
Uh, because the message is this, and I will read it without comedy.

563
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,420
Therefore, if it is a joke, we are legally, we're on sound ground.

564
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,980
If it's serious, we're legally protected.

565
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,700
Even though you were mutilated in that boating accident and left deformed from the waist up

566
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,580
and never venture into public out of fear and shame, I still love you very much and wish

567
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:26,340
you the hap-hap-happiest birthday you deservedly deserve.

568
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:33,460
Uh, Will, I'm sure will be writing to us soon to ask how to apologize for making, uh,

569
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,180
light of his other boating accident.

570
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,740
I don't think you can be deformed from the waist up.

571
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,660
I think there's some vital shit up there that, like, once you start tweaking with the recipe

572
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:50,980
a little bit, like, once you start, once you start adding in little, little tweaks to the

573
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,500
schematics, then once you start fucking with that, you're donezo.

574
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,340
Waist up is super important.

575
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,420
Waist up's like all the good stuff's there.

576
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,940
Uh, so happy birthday-

577
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,980
I used to believe it's true.

578
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,140
Happy birthday to Ainsley.

580
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,940
We're really sorry, either really sorry about your accident or really sorry about Will.

581
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,420
Either way, we're sorry, but happy birthday.

582
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,940
Travis, what about this other one?

583
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,980
What's the story here?

584
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,220
This next one's to Ryan from Zabs.

585
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Happy birthday to Ryan Alexander.

586
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,140
He introduced me to your awesome podcast, which just adds to how much awesomer he's

587
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,180
made my life.

588
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,860
Thanks for helping me fill the void between NBNB AM episodes.

589
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,100
Also, I hope you like this gift because it's exhausted my budget for your birthday.

590
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,940
Hugs and nags, hashtag.

591
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,220
Why didn't you read that word?

592
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,300
Because I don't know what it means.

593
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,680
Wow.

594
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,000
To fill the void between NBNB AM episodes, self-sajax.

595
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,360
Maybe that's his handle on the street.

596
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,040
Oh, like a CB handle?

597
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,560
It's his graffiti tag.

598
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,480
I thought that said, I thought that said hugs and nugs.

599
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,280
Hugs and nugs.

600
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,480
Me too.

601
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,400
We have 420 on the brain.

602
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,440
Did you guys spliff out?

603
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,960
Did you guys fire up a J and smoke yourselves?

604
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,160
I did, I ground up my weed and I snorted it.

605
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,560
I actually celebrated 420 the way I've celebrated everyone for the past few years.

606
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,640
Reading Facebook statuses of friends who are too old to smoke weed and are very mournful

607
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,440
about it.

608
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,520
I get a lot of that on the old wall now.

609
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,080
A lot of like, hey, you kids have fun.

610
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,840
I got too many responsibilities, but go ahead and smoke them if you know where to buy them.

611
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,640
I just boarded up the windows so that when all the reefer zombies attacked, I would be

612
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,120
safe.

613
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,800
Yeah, you got to look out for number one.

614
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,080
Do you guys remember back in the early days when there was like a cabal of our listeners

615
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,760
who thought that we were pot high pretty much all the time?

616
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,080
And I remember there was once where Justin took a pretty heinous sip of his coffee and

617
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,880
people thought it was a water, like a water pipe, like a water pipe for weed, not for

618
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
water transportation.

619
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,600
I still remember that.

620
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,920
For weed, not for water transportation.

621
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,320
I still don't know where to buy that.

622
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,840
So if you have some or just want to sell me some, that would be great.

623
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,720
If only it weren't so hard to find people that sold weed.

624
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,560
For me, it is.

625
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,680
Unless you're my FedEx guy or the lady at Starbucks, that's it.

626
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,440
That's the only people that could sell me weed that I interact with regularly.

627
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,080
Okay, I thought you were saying aside from those two dealers, I don't know any other

628
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,120
one.

629
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,800
Aside from my local librarian.

630
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,240
People at libraries gotta be selling weed a lot, right?

631
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,520
Yeah, why else would they be fucking interested in reading?

632
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,200
Spring has sprung.

633
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,800
A young man's fancy has turned to love.

634
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,400
And you know what that means?

635
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,480
It's dildo time.

636
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,880
Hey, happy dildo day, everybody.

637
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,960
This is dildo week here on my brother, my brother, and we were talking about-

638
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,400
The dildo has come out of his shell to see his shadow.

639
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,600
And now it's time for spring.

640
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,720
Came out of a butt.

641
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,960
Do you guys like huge dildos?

642
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,760
Give me some sort of metric, because that could mean, like, my definition of what a

643
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,720
huge dildo is, is probably different than what yours is.

644
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,040
If it looks like something that the eye of Sauron would appear above, like that's the

645
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,400
kind of thing I'm talking about.

646
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,240
I actually prefer a lot of really small dildos.

647
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,160
Is that better for you?

648
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,760
And it's just cuter.

649
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,400
It's fun.

650
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,280
It's like a dildo.

651
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,160
It's fun. It's like a cup of pins on a desk.

652
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,280
You know in that one scene in Fantasia where Mickey Mouse chops off the broom and it becomes

653
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
a bunch of brooms?

654
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,520
It's like that.

655
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,240
But with dildos.

656
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,720
Do they sell that on Extreme Restraints?

657
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,760
Do they sell-

658
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,880
Do they sell a young man's fancy on Extreme Restraints?

659
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,680
Can you buy that?

660
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,720
Can I buy my innocence back on Extreme Restraints?

661
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,440
I want to tell you guys about one very special dildo to me.

662
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,160
This is the Annihilator X.

663
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:59,080
X, and you guessed it, XL dildo.

664
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,360
This thing-

665
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
The extra X is for excellence.

666
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,920
This man looks like he is cradling a poodle.

667
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,000
A black, shiny poodle in front of his crotch.

668
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,440
It is 18 inches long and it is nine pounds.

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,000
Fuck!

670
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,040
How do you even-

671
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,720
How do you fucking operate that?

672
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,800
You gotta have a trusted friend.

673
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,640
You have to have an accomplice for this bilbo.

674
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
Or a running start.

675
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,280
Either way, I guess.

676
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,320
Yeah, I don't really understand.

677
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,000
Let me zip on out of the comments and see-

678
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,440
The comments are all just like, no, no, no, no.

679
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,120
I love how flexible this one is and I love taking it all the way to the base.

680
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,520
I felt like I would explode.

681
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,280
Now, folks, when you are leaving a product review on extremistrace.com,

682
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,400
it is so important to make sure it doesn't sound like you're bragging.

683
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,720
And this one seems very braggy to me.

684
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,920
It's like a backdoor brag.

685
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,080
I couldn't-

686
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,120
It's super good, though.

687
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,520
That was a super-

688
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,160
My husband, many years ago, suggested a threesome with his very well-endowed best friend.

689
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,480
My husband's small, only six inches long.

690
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:21,720
Uh-oh.

691
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,360
So she's still into threesomes, I guess.

692
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,520
And anyway, my husband, a few years ago, bought me this.

693
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,720
And OMG, it's huge and intense.

694
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,520
I was lucky.

695
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,480
I have sex a lot.

696
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,240
But with a very big cock.

697
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,560
But this, OMG, it's on a different level.

698
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,160
And so am I.

699
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,920
I am addicted to feeling stretched and maxing my pussy out.

700
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,680
Justin is no longer reading review.

701
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,560
He is just-

702
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,760
He is just letting-

703
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,520
He's forming thoughts-

704
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,120
Just forming thoughts in his brain and using his mouth to express them.

705
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,120
I actually love the power move of telling your wife you're gonna have a threesome

706
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,200
with your well-endowed friend.

707
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,680
Your well-endowed friend gets out his wiener.

708
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,320
And then he turns his back for just a second.

709
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,280
And that's when you whip out the Annihilator XXXL.

710
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,040
It really kills the appeal of Greg.

711
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,720
Show Greg where he belongs.

712
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,000
It also kills the person that it plunges into.

713
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,160
Are there any reviews?

714
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,520
Like, I am typing this as I'm using it for the first time and am now dead.

715
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,480
This period, I'm hitting the period, clicking the send button and dying.

716
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:40,840
This person says, when they said Annihilator and XXXL, they were not at all joking.

717
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,840
That would be a pretty-

718
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,680
This is the loved ones.

719
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,840
We came home, David had been shucked like a pistachio.

720
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,760
But he sure did look happy.

721
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,560
Thanks, Extremers.

722
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,800
He died with a smile on his face.

723
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Like a toddler ripping apart a fruit roll up.

724
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,440
Just split right in twain he was.

725
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,320
Oh, man.

726
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,520
Go check out ExtremeRestraints.com.

727
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,400
There are good things on there.

728
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,840
Not that this isn't a good thing, but there are things on there

729
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,160
that probably won't kill you starting from your butt.

730
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,800
That's kind of the more extreme-

731
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,600
That is as extreme as you can possibly go.

732
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,600

738

Do you guys want a Yahoo?

739
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,760
Absolutely.

740
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
This Yahoo was sent in by Alicia M. M.

741
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,560
Thank you, Alicia.

742
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,600
It's by fucking Yahoo Answers user, John.

743
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,560
I just got tired-

744
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,600
I just got exhausted from sitting forward in my chair.

745
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,600
Rough day.

746
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,200
Rough afternoon.

747
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:04,520
Uh, John asks, is it normal for a guy, 24, to kiss cats in a pet store?

748
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,640
I go to a pet store, and when I find the cats I like, I hold him,

749
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,000
may hug him, and kiss him all through his body except face.

750
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,640
As if I was kissing a dear friend of mine.

751
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,520
Is that normal?

752
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,280
Or is that unacceptable and perv?

753
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,080
I'm sorry to Justin and Travis that I didn't read this question beforehand

754
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,040
and did not catch the part where he says he kisses everywhere except the mouth.

755
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,720
Like, pretty woman.

756
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,160
Okay, first things first.

757
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,400
Normal is an illusion invented by corporate America to keep you docile.

758
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,120
Yeah.

759
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,920
Second-

760
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
I mean, that is like day one.

761
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,360
That's day one.

762
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,400
Don't talk about normal in day-to-day life.

763
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,440
I don't even want to hear about that.

764
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,040
That TV show, The New Normal?

765
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,400
I don't want to hear about that.

766
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,760
No, The New Normal is the old normal because normal doesn't exist.

767
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,600
That said, on behalf of kitty cats, don't-

768
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,560
Please don't kiss them.

769
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Hey, please don't kiss the kitty cat that you don't-

770
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,560
that you don't have, that you don't support fiscally and emotionally.

771
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,840
You know, we all own cats.

772
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,560
There's a very good chance this gentleman has kissed our cats all over.

773
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,400
But except as long as it's not in the head, then I can look that cat in the face.

774
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,920
I can respect my cat still as a man.

775
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,520
Is it normal for a guy 24 to kiss strangers at a bus stop?

776
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,080
It's not.

777
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,760
It's not-

778
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,280
It is not okay to do that.

779
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,560
Is it okay to go to a nursery and just kiss all the babies I see everywhere except the face?

780
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,360
Super not okay.

781
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,080
Super not normal 24.

782
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,560
Normal, again, is an illusion that typical is the word.

783
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,880
Typical behavior, no.

784
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,200
Is it orthodox behavior to smooch all the kitties everywhere, all over their bodies?

785
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,640
If I'm running a pet store and some guy smooches one of my kitties, I assume he's buying it.

786
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,640
I'm like, where's your credit card?

787
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,920
Because you just bought a kitty.

788
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,360
You point to the poster by the wall and it says, you smooch it, you bought it.

789
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,040
You smooch it, you bought it, weird beard.

790
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,040
You can tell, too.

791
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,600
If you go to a pet store and you look at a cat and it has that smooched look, you're gonna buy it

792
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,120
because it looks smooched.

793
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,880
It's just been smooched hair.

794
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,840
Come on.

795
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,120
All through his body.

796
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,760
This guy is fucking hoisting these-

797
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,920
You're the clerk at this pet store and you see this guy and he's going like up and down the tail.

798
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,440
Like he's demolishing a corn cob or something.

799
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,640
Just not missing a kernel of unsmooched fur.

800
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,040
And you are just jerking it.

801
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,800
Oh, why would you do that?

802
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,400
No, I mean, the clerk is jerking.

803
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,200
It's not weird.

804
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,120
Oh, if the clerk's jerking, then it's fine.

805
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,800
That's the new normal.

806
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,920
That's the new normal.

807
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,120
We've just established it.

808
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,280
Is that what that show's about?

809
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,400
Oh, man.

810
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,880
Every week they pick a new-

811
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,720
So there's two guys.

812
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,280
Yes.

813
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,440
They go to the pet store and every week one of the guys picks a different animal.

814
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,400
Maybe it's an iguana.

815
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,720
Maybe it's a big bird.

816
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,120
And then he smooches it while the other one masturbates.

817
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,760
Would you guys watch a reality show where the whole thing is how many animals can a person

818
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,000
kiss in a pet store before they're ejected?

819
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,920
Before they ejaculate?

820
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,560
Is that what you said?

821
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,480
No, I said before they're dejected.

822
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,200
That's the most-

823
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,040
They look at themselves and give up.

824
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,280
God.

825
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,800
How could you do this?

826
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,360
How could you do this thing?

827
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,160
Just buy one.

828
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,440
Let me drop my age in here.

829
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,240
I'm gonna kiss these cats all over their body.

830
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,000
Let me just drop my age in here because that could be a defining factor.

831
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,800
I'm not 12.

832
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,080
But I'm not 45, which I-

833
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,560
You know what?

834
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,080
Now that I say it, it would be stranger.

835
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,320
That would be stranger, wouldn't it?

836
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:08,200
But if I see a 24-year-old kissing every cat in the room, I assume that he's trying to

837
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,160
rush a fraternity.

838
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,680
Well, 24 is a little old for that.

839
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,960
Oh, he was held back a few years.

840
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,520
Okay, see, now we're developing some fiction.

841
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,600
Now we have a story.

842
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Is it possible he's been offered a job in this pet store and he's asking if it's a

843
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,160
weird job?

844
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,720
Is there maybe- is he maybe watching someone do this as he furiously types into Yahoo and

845
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,360
tries to find out if he should, in fact, eject this person from his store, as he suspects?

846
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,720
He and a friend saw it, and now they're debating about its relative normalcy.

847
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,800
I don't know, it seemed fine to me.

848
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,200
He looked about 24, so that's-

849
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,560
I don't see the big deal.

850
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,880
That's about the right age to do it, if you're gonna do it.

851
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,200
You're gonna do it, might as well do it at that age.

852
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,700
24.

853
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,300
We're all looking for direction at that age.

854
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,580
Kissing animals is the weirdest- if you kiss- if you let your dog lick your mouth, I'm done

855
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,300
with you.

856
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,100
I think it's- I think that- I don't know, I don't have-

857
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,100
I think it's cute, their mouths are cleaner than our mouths, Griffin.

858
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Yeah, Griffin, read a book.

859
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,100
It's really cute when that happens, because they're giving you puppy smooches.

860
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
Okay, I don't want to talk about this anymore.

861
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,300
I'm getting yucked out.

862
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,100
Puppy smooches.

863
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:24,220
Okay, at my college, there is a sweet old lady who works reception.

864
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,380
She likes to give people nicknames, usually harmless ones, like normal.

865
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,500
Here's the problem.

866
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:35,340
I guess she just started watching Pawn Stars, because now she's saying I look like Chumlee

867
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,140
from that show.

868
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,020
I think it's Chumlee, you're saying it like the Street Fighter.

869
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,900
Okay, Chumlee.

870
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,540
She's saying I look like Blanca, which is strange.

871
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,620
It's something you can- has begun calling me that.

872
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:54,140
I know, as a big guy, I don't have a good crop to pick from in celeb lookalikes.

873
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,140
Oh, man.

874
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,900
This lady is like 90.

875
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,820
How could I tell her politely that I don't appreciate being compared to a dude who looks

876
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,100
like he showers in grease and seems to have mild brain damage?

877
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:12,460
At this point, I will settle for Kevin Smith, and that's from Backhanded in Houston.

878
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,580
Yeah, you've got a- yes, it is bad.

879
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,700
I'll give it to you straight.

880
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,900
You got a bad- you got dealt a bad hand here, Chumlee.

881
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,140
But on the other hand, it could be so much worse.

882
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,180
It could be worse.

883
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,460
It couldn't, though.

884
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,020
It couldn't.

885
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,780
He's really- that's a really rough one.

886
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:34,540
That's a really pretty bad one, because it's like- it's not only- it's not only like a

887
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:40,300
bad reference to a person who's bad, it's a reference to a bad show, and like by acknowledging

888
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,340
that you get it, people are going to think you watch Pawn Stars.

889
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,940
And Pawn Stars is awesome.

890
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:50,620
I think it would be cool to force her hand on this, though, because say that you don't

891
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:56,860
know- you don't understand the reference, and force her to explain the similarities

892
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,420
that you have with Chumlee.

893
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,620
Say, is Chumlee like some kind of like young, handsome, funny guy?

894
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:07,020
Yeah, young, rakish, well-endowed college student, 24, loves to kiss cats?

895
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,260
Is it because he's some kind of a young stud who really loves old broads?

896
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,380
Make that old broad look you in the face and tell you you're fat.

897
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,460
You look- he's a person who is- looks like he is made of hams, and that's what I think

898
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,860
of you.

899
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:22,940
Enjoy your day.

900
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,060
Make her say that, and then use that, because you're going to turn your life around.

901
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,660
You're going to walk into this lady's office one day, and she's going to be like,

902
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,820
Chumlee, and you're going to be like, more like Guile, because you're going to have like

903
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,620
big guns.

904
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,500
And she's going to pull down her big old glasses, and just look at you and go, damn!

905
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,820
She's going to pull down her big old panties.

906
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,700
You're going to have sex with that old woman.

907
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,140
That's your new thing.

908
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,500
Every time you're in training, I want you to imagine having sex with that old woman,

909
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,620
giving her the old what for.

910
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,060
You know what I mean?

911
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,300
That's not- that is not something I want to think of.

912
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,380
I don't want to think about this person on The Biggest Loser like, think- you got to

913
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,420
use your motivation!

914
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,860
And like, oh, fucking, I got it.

915
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,500
I'm ready to go.

916
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,180
I'm going to seduce this old lady.

917
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,580
You have a huge boner, and there are other people waiting to get on the treadmill.

918
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,620
Bingo's in the corner.

919
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,340
He's watching you.

920
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,260
I don't know this Bingo.

921
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,060
Should I know Bingo?

922
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,100
Everyone needs to know Bingo to get any of my references anymore.

923
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,620
Everyone fucking do some- that's your homework.

924
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,740
That's your take home for this episode of the podcast.

925
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,580
Everybody look up who- everybody Google Bingo Biggest Loser, and you're going to see him.

926
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,540
You're going to see this living ball of sunshine that God has given us on this earth.

927
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,460
It's a handsome young man.

928
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,260
And then when I mention him on the show, and when I mention The Biggest Loser, you're

929
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,340
going to be- you're going to feel erudite.

930
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:54,060
So that's what we want you to work on for the- for next week, for the seven days you

931
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,260
have to do without us.

932
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,380
We so appreciate you joining us once again.

933
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,460
Thanks for making it to the end of this one.

934
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,060
This was- I'm not saying it was good or bad, but it was- I just was- man, I'm so tired.

935
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,740
It just- I think that after you edit it, maybe it'll be funnier.

936
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,620
After I edit it, it'll be- Yeah, it'll be 12 minutes long.

937
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,820
12 minutes long.

938
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,660
What happened to all that stuff about Robocop?

939
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,500
I'll think to myself as I listen to it afterwards, because that's the thing I do.

940
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,660
I know.

941
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,940
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

942
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,100
Thank you to Daniel Franzen, Patty Windsor, Y.V.

943
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:33,340
Ritesh, Dan Bowden, Phil Rose, and Nicole.

944
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,700
That's blue Nicole, mind you.

945
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,700
And H.L. Peacock, everybody tweeting about the show.

946
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,500
We really appreciate it.

947
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,260
Please use the nbmvm hashtag and throw a link to our sample in there if you're going to

948
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,820
tweet about the show.

949
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,180
It's bit.ly forward slash itsmabimbam.

950
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,700
Super big thanks again to everybody who donated during Maximum Fun Drive.

951
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,540
We did super well for the network.

952
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,660
The people who pick their shows after they donate, we did super, super well for that.

953
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,980
And so it's, I don't know, it's really flattering not only that people are willing to support

954
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,580
us, but that we are on this network of people who I think are the funniest people in the

955
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,420
world, and that you guys are supporting us.

956
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:21,260
I want to say also a couple of thank yous to people who have mailed us things.

957
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:26,940
That's P.O. Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

958
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,340
We got a postcard from Rachel, who was visiting the Crazy Horse Monument.

959
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:37,580
So she sent us a picture of a Native American, so we appreciate that.

960
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:43,580
And a giant thank you to Justin Gray, who, if you don't know Justin Gray, he made two

961
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,900
amazing posters from my brother, my brother and me, like year in review posters.

962
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,460
Oh, shit.

963
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,580
And he printed three of each of them and sent them to us, and I have them.

964
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,620
Ah, I want those.

965
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,060
I know, I'll get them to you.

966
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:02,620
And if you have not seen those, it's burntobuild.blogspot.com.

967
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,100
Forward slash.

968
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,980
Forward slash.

969
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,900
Admin, forward slash.

970
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,340
So make sure you go look at those.

971
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,460
I wish you would make more.

972
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,740
I'd love for people to be able to do it.

973
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,180
Well, don't fucking guilt the guy.

974
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,140
Well, no, I'm saying like let's get rich.

975
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,940
I'm disappointed.

976
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,300
I'm disappointed in his output.

977
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,340
We need to merch up.

978
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,700
Merch up.

979
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,260
We do.

980
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,580
For real.

981
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,380
We haven't merged in a while, and people are always like, well, when's your new hit coming?

982
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,220
And we're like, soon.

983
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,600
Soon.

984
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,020
If you got some merch you'd like to see from us, let us know.

985
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:42,780
Also, speaking of, big thank you to hoodwinkedfool on the Twitters.

986
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:49,260
They remixed our Daft Punk song from last week's episode and posted a video of it on Facebook.

987
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:49,740
Oh, fuck.

988
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,460
We'll post the link again.

989
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,420
Yeah, I got to listen to that.

990
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,140
It's so good.

991
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,020
Oh, yeah, it's good.

992
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,900
It's hype.

993
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,020
And thank you to you.

994
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,300
Did you already thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of the theme song

995
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,540
It's a Departure off the album Put the Days to Bed?

996
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,900
No, I want to thank, I really want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for this song.

997
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:06,960
Good.

998
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,180
And thank you to you so much, Griffin.

999
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,460
Do you have one more question for us?

1000
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,500
Yeah, I can, let me scrounge one up here.

1001
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,740
Just dig into the scraps.

1002
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,980
And this Yahoo was sent in by David Pounce.

1003
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,700
Thank you, David Pounce.

1004
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:24,060
It's by Yahoo Answers user John889743 who asks,

1005
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,340
Is Eminem the new Socrates of our times?

1006
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,260
I'm Justin McElroy.

1007
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,380
I'm Travis McElroy.

1008
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1009
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,620
He's been my brother, my brother.

1010
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,420
May he kiss your dad.

1011
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:51,180
It's cool way on the lips.
