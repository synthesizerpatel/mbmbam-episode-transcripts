1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,400
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:04,400
And me? Well, I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm your youngest one, Griffin McElroy. Why do we laugh? We record these on Thursdays,

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,440
we have no fucking idea what kind of a weekend ahead of us we have.

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,840
Laughter may not be the order of the day come Monday afternoon,

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
but I don't know, man. May as well laugh when you can, right?

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Hey, all things considered, not a bad week. All things considered, not a bad week.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Comparatively, all things considered, if you were to take all things into consideration,

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,760
not a bad week, here's what I was going to say. If you told me one calendar year ago

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,680
that the week that contained a day that I woke up with a fever thinking I had a deadly virus,

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,160
then got tested for that deadly virus, and I would think of that week as a pretty good week.

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,360
Yeah. I would have not believed what you were saying.

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
I would not have believed it, but that situation did transpire.

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah. Everything's fine. But still, pretty good week.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
You know, if you had told me when I was a young lad of, say, eight or nine,

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,840
that there would come a week where a fly landing on someone's head was national news,

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,320
I would have laughed in your face. So fucking funny.

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,000
And he landed there. I would have laughed in your face.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,240
The bug landed there because it was shit, and he smelled the shit,

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
and he wanted to eat it and barf on it, which is what flies do.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
That's pretty much what everyone's going with.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Oh, shit. It's fucking good, man.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I do want to point out two things. One, still very bad things

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
happen during the week. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,120
It was a terrible, terrible, terrible week. But also, it's Thursday at 1.42 central time,

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
which is the only time zone that matters to me.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,600
By the time this episode comes out, there are three days, dudes,

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,480
where totally not righteous stuff can, will…

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
Yeah, will happen.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,080
Yeah, we're recording this several days before, so absolutely.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,960
So I don't know why you guys are calling this fucking wild.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I guess it's…

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Calendar. I'm going by calendar. Since last Thursday.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
Thursday to Thursday. Pretty bad week.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,640
Now, let me say this. If we were able to cut and paste this week into, say, 2011,

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,240
this would have been the worst week of 2011. You know what I mean?

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,880
That's what I'm talking about. But here, in 2020…

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,080
A fly landed on our American vice president's head.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,520
Wouldn't that have been ironic? Where it landed on Joe Biden's head back in 2010?

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh, now the dots are starting to connect. Thank you, Travis.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
The fly was a little tiny drone.

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,800
That's wild to think about.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
But it's definitely true.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,560
Now, here's what I'm wondering.

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Are we going to say, man, I hope this isn't true, but like in 2030,

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,880
we'll look back on this week and be like, no one can withstand this.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,520
You're probably right. Or maybe we'll look back and be like,

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
there's no way that week happened.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
If I'm still allowed to think in 2030, I will consider that a success.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,840
That's fair.

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,920
That will be a high watermark.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
That is fair. That is fair.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,760
This is my brother, my brother, me. It's the Vice Show for the Modern Era.

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,680
We're so happy to be here with you.

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
We got a special guest, the fly!

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,400
Haha, here he is.

63
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,120
I can't believe we…

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,920
I landed on the dude's head because the things he's saying is total bullshit.

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
So are you voting for Joe Biden?

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm actually, as all bugs are, a registered libertarian.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,680
I've heard Jorgensen like Ken Bone.

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,200
I did have a thought, you guys.

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Can you imagine, here we are four years later,

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,440
to be Ken Bone and to look at the news and realize

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,800
I share the same amount of like public affection as a fly does now.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
Like in 2016, he was the fly.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
The fly is the Ken Bone of 2020.

74
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,480
The fly is the Ken Bone, the Ken Bone is the fly.

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
That must be a sobering realization.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
I cannot believe…

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,920
Can we briefly, I'm just going to briefly talk about Ken Bone,

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,800
who is, by the way, not a good person.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,200
No, okay.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,560
Judging by the Reddit history, not a good person, Ken Bone.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
So I want to say that upfront established.

82
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,440
Second thing I want to say, can you imagine there was a person

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,920
who was so hee-haw stupid that they couldn't pick

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,040
who they wanted to be the president and a real reporter,

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
a paid reporter was like,

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,520
I have got to check back in with that dude and see where his head was at.

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,960
He was so, so absolutely out of his melon that he couldn't make a decision.

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
I wonder where his head is at now.

89
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
This is a big thinker.

90
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
I got to see where he's at.

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,400
I got to see where he's at.

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
A free thinker.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,040
A free thinker.

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Think of it that way, Chewce.

95
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,440
He's free to take his vote and flush it right on the fucking toilet.

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,760
Okay.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,360
Ken Bone also probably doesn't…

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
He probably only owns red sweaters, right?

99
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
At this point, he's a full-blown…

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah.

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
He's a full-blown bone.

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
Full-blown bone.

103
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
That's his thing, you know what I mean?

104
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
Like, he only knows how to be Ken Bone.

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
I hope he's doing the con circuit.

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,480
Anyway, listen…

107
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,280
I hope he's not because if he is, I'm going to have to see him

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
and I'm going to have to say,

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
I wish they could have gotten the fly.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,880
It's too bad the fly is too popular.

111
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,040
God, we could do more fly stuff,

112
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
but you know it's going to be on SNL

113
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
and this will come out after I smell the funky that we're beating.

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
Well, let's call it.

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,200
Oh, let's call it.

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,920
This will be fun.

117
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,960
We're recording this three days before then.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,640
What do you think is going to…

119
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,960
I think it'll be probably a weekend update bit.

120
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,640
Fuck.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,360
Oh, no, no, no.

122
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,400
It's in the intro.

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
Oh, really?

124
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,320
They zoom in on the fly and it's like Fred Armisen is back to be the fly.

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh, shit.

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
Oh, that's good.

127
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
That's good.

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
What if it's like a Godfather kind of thing where they got Jim Carrey.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
He's playing Jabiden and Jabiden is like sitting in his desk,

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,040
but it's like, you know, one downward light and the fly comes

131
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,560
and Jabiden's like, you did it.

132
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,200
The thing I…

133
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Yeah, now what can I do for you?

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,640
And the fly's like, I just want a big pile of shit.

135
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,960
Yeah.

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
Until like do rails up or whatever.

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,640
I haven't seen Godfather.

138
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,760
And then Jabiden's like, you got it.

139
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,320
Live from New York, it's Saturday night.

140
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,720
That's it.

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,200
That's it.

142
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
That's it.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Didn't watch…

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,760
Couldn't bring myself to watch Jim Carrey's Jabiden

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,000
because I just saw the thumbnail image and I was like, I don't think…

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,120
My anxiety over this election is so high that I do not need my mayonnaise ventura in there,

147
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
sort of poking about my neurons, getting them all twisted up, getting me…

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
I mean, busting my gut, busting my family's gut for sure.

149
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,640
I guess I just worry that if I saw it, it would bust my gut so hard

150
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,800
that all my intestines would spill out.

151
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah, happens sometimes.

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,960
Which would be pretty spooky.

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,760
Yeah.

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Happy Halloween, everybody.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,160
All right.

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
Oh, the fly.

157
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
Sexy the fly is going to be huge this Halloween.

158
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
Oh my God.

159
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Sexy the fly.

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
I mean, flies are already…

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
What if they get…

162
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,760
What if they get Goblin?

163
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,480
Oh.

164
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Oh.

165
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,000
What if they get Goblin though?

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
What if they get Goblin?

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,800
Okay, let's help.

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Last week, after working at my current job for nearly two and a half years,

169
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,800
my boss finally granted me lockup privileges.

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,280
Nice.

171
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,160
That is, of course, if you haven't been in a job for a while,

172
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,800
you are allowed to lock up insubordinate employees until they do things the Subway way.

173
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
Right, in the boo-boo box.

174
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, which is also where they keep the vegetables.

175
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,920
When he gave me the key, he said, now, don't you lose this.

176
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
And throughout the week, he kept telling me to take good care of it.

177
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,760
At the end of the last day, before I was going to open the store by myself for the first time,

178
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
he said, you sure you're ready?

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
You haven't lost the key?

180
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
I got so annoyed that I kind of snapped.

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
No, I haven't lost it since the last time you asked.

182
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
Now, I'm sure you can tell where this is going.

183
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
Because when I got home, I couldn't find the damn key anywhere.

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,240
So please, how the hell do I tell my boss that I lost the freaking key?

185
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,520
Do I just not open the store tomorrow and I hope he doesn't notice?

186
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,680
How will I ever gain back his misplaced trust that's from lockdown and ashamed?

187
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
Oh, you're never going to, you're never going to gain back that trust.

188
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,880
How did you, how could you possibly have fucked this up so bad?

189
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
So frustrated with you.

190
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,720
You gotta-

191
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
I'll tell you my theory.

192
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,160
My theory, as you, like, when your boss handed it to you,

193
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
it fell out of your pocket as you were leaving the room, like that long ago.

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
And your boss picked it up and was like, well,

195
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm going to give them a fucking hard time about this.

196
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,840
I love that.

197
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
That's very possible.

198
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
The boss knew the whole time.

199
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh yeah, or the boss stole it.

200
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah, I mean-

201
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
They caught me if you can, dear.

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,160
I have a good, I mean, to use another film reference as a solution,

203
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
it's Wonderful Life.

204
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,680
Huh.

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh, your uncle Billy.

206
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,280
Your uncle, your uncle Billy, you lost the key or the money or the key.

207
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,200
And so George is like, um, this sucks.

208
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,080
But then I'm fucked, I'm fucked, oh man.

209
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,680
I'm fucked, you fucked me, Billy.

210
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
I told my boss-

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,520
You fucked me.

212
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Billy, Billy, I'm fucked.

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
You make me look like a real fucking idiot.

214
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,860
Billy.

215
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Well, well, well, well, you fucked me in the ass, Billy.

216
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
Billy, I got kids, Billy, you fuck.

217
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm an angel.

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
Billy, you're fucking me in front of my kids.

219
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm an angel sent by Jesus, but I can't even around all this.

220
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
Billy, are you pulling my hair?

221
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,920
Are you pulling my hair?

222
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
Because I like to have my hair pulled when I get fucked, Billy.

223
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,560
That was a long interruption for what is not going to be a very good idea.

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
But I was saying that all the townspeople who you've helped with your generosity

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,840
and selflessness over the years will come and give you their keys.

226
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,160
Now, unless those townspeople live at the subway,

227
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
girlfriend, it's not going to help.

228
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,440
Well, I think that one of the keys will be close enough to fit that it'll open the door.

229
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,320
That's true.

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,960
You could use God's keys, which is what I call a brick.

231
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Okay.

232
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,840
Smash that door in.

233
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,360
And then when your boss comes, you say,

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
I found it like this, boss, but I'm not leaving here until it gets repaired.

235
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,960
And bad news, somebody stole the key too out of my pocket while I was picking up glass.

236
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
What's bad is like, I was going to suggest that.

237
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
So that is actually troubling.

238
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,160
What, the smashing the window or the stealing the key?

239
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Smashing the window, you put a brick through the window,

240
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,360
you reach around, you open it, and they're like, they got you.

241
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry, boss, but they got you.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
They got you again.

243
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,080
Classic prank.

244
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,960
The old window brick.

245
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Can I do a Yahoo?

246
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, I'd love that.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
This one was sent in by Steven.

248
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Thank you, Steven.

249
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

250
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,680
Sorry, real quick to jump back.

251
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
You should tell your boss you lost it

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,880
because the satisfaction they'll feel at that will be so overwhelmingly positive for them.

253
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,380
Yeah.

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Brandon asks, stupid Power Rangers question.

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,480
Yeah.

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
No such thing, but go on.

257
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
There's no such thing as a stupid Power Rangers question.

258
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,520
Just stupid people.

259
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,200
Just stupid Power Rangers.

260
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
Stupid actors.

261
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
In the beginning of the show, when Zordon needs new Power Rangers,

262
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
why did he ask for teenagers with attitudes?

263
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Wouldn't it be better to get some guys that have formal special ops training?

264
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
It just seems irresponsible.

265
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,600
No.

266
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
Oh, God, that is a stupid...

267
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm sorry, that is a stupid question.

268
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,600
Obviously, Zordon wanted to be able to train them himself, right?

269
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
If you get people with special ops training,

270
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
they're gonna do it the way they've been trained.

271
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,040
Okay, but Zordon doesn't ever pop out of his hologram display and is like,

272
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,640
let me show you teens how to do a real bicycle kick.

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,640
This is where to put your hands to snap a man's neck.

274
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,880
And that fucking robot's not teaching them how to do their moves.

275
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,000
Alpha 5, no way.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,520
No way, so they just have their little power coins

277
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,680
and that gives them all the training they need.

278
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Zordon doesn't teach them shit.

279
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
So a little bit of endemic, systemic fighting knowledge

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,880
in a stable adult with a 401k,

281
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:33,680
like somebody who is financially independent and just very confident in themselves.

282
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay, Griffin, let's try that out.

283
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,600
I'll get the adult with formal special ops training like I have

284
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,200
and you are Zordon trying to recruit me to your Power Ranger group, I guess.

285
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes, okay, Toady, I am Zordon, I know that you know all kinds of cool fighting moves

286
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,480
and you have a big job with the city and an apartment in the city.

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
You are in a long-term dating relationship.

288
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
Yeah, it's getting pretty serious.

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,480
And your fighting abilities are, they exist and you can do them.

290
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes, I can.

291
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,040
So Rita Repulsa is back and she's-

292
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,200
She's got all of her gooey guys doing their bad stuff.

293
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay, what do you want me to do?

294
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,960
Well, I'm going to, let me fucking finish.

295
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,280
Okay.

296
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,360
I have this little power coin and it lets you turn,

297
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,760
it changes your clothes into different, like a superhero clothes

298
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,200
and then you will get sometimes a dinosaur robot.

299
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,920
Well, I like the dinosaur robot part, but like, what does it pay?

300
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,240
I told you about the power coin and the dinosaur robot.

301
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
No, I know that, but like, as you mentioned, I have an apartment, I need to pay rent.

302
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
Like, what's the pay?

303
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,320
Excuse me for a moment, Toady.

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,800
Okay.

305
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,480
Can my girlfriend's kids come hang out at the power base or whatever?

306
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Because sometimes I, and like, what's parking and like, what's the healthcare scenario?

307
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
I actually watch them, she goes to night school, so I actually watch them a lot of the time.

308
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,600
They're cool.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,520
Most, you can give them like a Paw Patrol coloring book and they'll be fine.

310
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
They'll be fine.

311
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,480
Or make them, what's it, power people or whatever?

312
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
Yeah, can they be like tiny power people?

313
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
Wait, why didn't I think of that?

314
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,080
I can just make everyone on earth power people.

315
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,280
And then, and then Rita's really fucked, isn't she?

316
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,400
Well, have you thought about like restructuring, what's a robot for?

317
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
I mean, no offense robot, but like-

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,840
Well, sometimes the gooey guys get real big, Toady.

319
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Uh-huh.

320
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,920
Do you think Zordon's ever like, you didn't lose your morpher, did you?

321
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,360
Did you?

322
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,560
Did you?

323
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
Promise me.

324
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah, sorry, my mom found my morpher and she used it.

325
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
So now she's just flying a pterodactyl around.

326
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,240
My mom found my morpher and she thought it was a bong and she grounded me, Zordon.

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,480
Now I can't do any crime fighting today.

328
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
So thanks so much, Zordon.

329
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,040
Thanks so much.

330
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Please FaceTime my mom.

331
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,000
Please take my mom on a date so she will-

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Zordon, I need you to seduce my mom.

333
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,880
Zordon, seduce my mom so she'll leave the house

334
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
and I can foil Rita Repulse's plans once again.

335
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
How many fucking times do I have to tell you, dad?

336
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
I mean, Zordon, oops.

337
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,640
Sorry.

338
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,960
Sorry.

339
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Sorry, Zordad.

340
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,160
Happens to me all the time.

341
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,280
Get the fuck out of here.

342
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,200
Get out of here.

343
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
What is the robot's name?

344
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,320
Isn't it Alpha Five?

345
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,400
It's Alpha Five, as I said.

346
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

347
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,480
Do you think that Power Rangers ever asked Zordon for help with their homework?

348
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah.

349
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah, probably.

350
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,240
There's probably-

351
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
And Alpha Five's a robot.

352
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,920
Just do my-

353
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
Hey, listen, here's the deal.

354
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
If you want me to fight Rita Repulse,

355
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,800
you gotta do my homework for me, Alpha Five, because I can't get it.

356
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
These kids are gonna be so busy fighting crime,

357
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,320
they're gonna go to college and they're gonna be like,

358
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
so anyway, open your books.

359
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
And they're like, I never learned to read.

360
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
I was too busy punching a big, I don't know, octopus thing.

361
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
Hey, Zordon, how do you ask a girl on a date?

362
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,600
Ah, you just teleport her to your science station,

363
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,360
and give her a big coin.

364
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,760
I don't think that's okay.

365
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,960
That doesn't seem right.

366
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,720
Have you tried showing her your xenon crystals?

367
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,280
No.

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,880
No, I mean, I'm without consent.

369
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
I didn't think she would like my xenon crystals.

370
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,800
I think if I did get visited by an angel of Zordon's,

371
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,480
and they offered me to be a grown-up Power Ranger,

372
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
I would probably, and like they would give me a coin

373
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
that let me transform into cool suits and get a dinosaur robot,

374
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
I still think it's gonna be a no.

375
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,040
Like as neat as that sounds, it also sounds like a great deal of work

376
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,600
for what, as Justin pointed, or as Travis pointed out,

377
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
one of you fucking guys pointed out,

378
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,000
is an unpaid internship with a space alien.

379
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,560
And if I'm being honest, I mean, I'm 36 years old,

380
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,800
almost 37, I got two kids, but the truth is,

381
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
being a Power Ranger is a level of responsibility

382
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
I don't think I can handle,

383
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,960
and I don't even mean like fighting the bad guys.

384
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
I mean, those Zords look pretty difficult to pilot.

385
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I think I fucked that up pretty bad,

386
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
and I don't think you can get insurance on those dang things.

387
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
It's just that Rita's gonna keep sending her gooey guys.

388
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,800
So like, it's easy for me to say no,

389
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,320
I don't want this responsibility,

390
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,480
and somebody braver with me with more free time would say yes,

391
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,560
but I guess that makes me a bad person.

392
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:38,880
Shit.

393
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,200
No.

394
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
The major thing would have made sense

395
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
if he had only gotten homeschool kids.

396
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay.

397
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,000
Go go Mighty Morphin homeschool kid Power Rangers.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,560
Now why is that?

399
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,520
Then it's like they have incredible adult-shaped bodies,

400
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
lithe, powerful, in the prime of their lives.

401
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,400
Okay.

402
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,000
But they also like don't have to be in school.

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
They could just sort of tell their mom like,

404
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
listen mom, I'm gonna go, I don't know,

405
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
actualize or something.

406
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
What do homeschool parents like to do?

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,680
That's it.

408
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,960
That kind of thing.

410
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm gonna meditate.

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,720
Hey, weren't the Big Bad Beetleborgs like literally 10?

412
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,000
We actually, Travis, I got a letter.

413
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,120
Oh no.

414
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah, I got a letter from podcasts that we are,

415
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,960
we as a podcast have talked about Big Bad Beetleborgs.

416
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
The maximum number of times.

417
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
We used up our Big Bad Beetle quota.

418
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, we did.

419
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,040
It looks like in 2022 more slots are gonna open up, Travis.

420
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,280
So like episode six, like 623 or so,

421
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
if my math adds up, maybe we can.

422
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
I'll save it.

423
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,600
What we are doing is entering into sort of a cap and trade

424
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,920
situation with 99% invisible,

425
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
which to my knowledge has never talked about

426
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,800
Big Bad Beetleborgs.

427
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,080
That's the other 1%.

428
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,680
That's the 1% right there.

429
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,600
We're buying some of their credits

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,120
and in exchange we have to plug the 99% invisible city,

431
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,920
the new book from Roman Mars and 99% invisible.

432
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,680
We have to plug that and then they are in exchange

433
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
for talking about their fantastic book.

434
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,800
We're gonna get a few credits to talk about Big Bad Beetleborgs.

435
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,400
Okay, why was the house haunted?

436
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Doesn't that seem like a hat on a hat?

437
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,440
Yeah, you're fighting things in your Big Bad Beetleborgs

438
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,200
but also your house is like a haunted house.

439
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,840
What the fuck?

440
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
That's really how you're gonna, huh?

441
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,480
Well, that's how I'm gonna use it.

442
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,200
You guys can try it.

443
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,840
Let me try this.

444
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,400
Okay.

445
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
Boy howdy, the genie character sure looks offensive

446
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,400
but I can't put my finger on to which peoples.

447
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
I think it's only to Jay Leno.

448
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
It's offensive to Jay Leno's?

449
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,520
Wow, he does sure look a hell of a lot like Joseph Leno.

450
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
It's a good amount.

451
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah, it's a good amount that a flabber looks like Joseph Leno.

452
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
It does kind of look like someone said,

453
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,280
hey, can you draw Joseph Leno from memory?

454
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
And they said, yeah, I think so.

455
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,160
I think so.

456
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
Do you think the Power Rangers ever went to Zordon's secret cave

457
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,680
when there wasn't stuff to do

458
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,360
and they just wanted somebody to talk to?

459
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,860
Yeah.

460
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm not really comfortable with this.

461
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,560
This isn't like a social thing.

462
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,000
This isn't, I have other things that I don't think you did.

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
I have my own friends.

464
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
I like to separate work and home.

465
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm binging justified.

466
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,320
This isn't my thing.

467
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
No spoilers.

468
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm only on season two.

469
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
Now leave me in my giant bong.

470
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,040
My parents have been fighting a lot lately.

471
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh gosh.

472
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
Oh, what's that?

473
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
Oh, Rita's attacking the aquarium.

474
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,780
Oh no.

475
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,120
Do you want another mammoth robot?

476
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
Hold on, let me see what I got in the back.

477
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,480
Okay, I'm going to send you to the moon.

478
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm going to send you to the moon?

479
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
Is that anything?

480
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,560
I got a plesiosaur robot back here.

481
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,960
Will that help with your parents fighting?

482
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,320
Probably.

483
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
I don't think so, Zordon.

484
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,080
I brought Tommy back from the dead.

485
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
How does that make you feel?

486
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,420
Okay.

487
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,320
Here's another question.

488
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,560
I was out on my lunch break running a few errands

489
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,160
when I spotted a taco truck.

490
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
It honestly sounded amazing.

491
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
So I pulled over.

492
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
Few problems though.

493
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
Truck was parked in the parking lot of fire station

494
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
and everyone in line had matching shirts.

495
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,200
Was this taco truck only for the firefighters

496
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
and everyone working there?

497
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
How do I get in on this lunch?

498
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
That's from Desperate for Tacos in Des Moines.

499
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,040
This is, boys, this is a choice cut.

500
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,760
This is a quandary that I feel like nobody

501
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
has really tried to solve.

502
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
So I feel like we have an opportunity right here

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,320
to plant our flag in this fertile ground.

504
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,560
Now I'm going to give the question asker

505
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,080
the benefit of the doubt

506
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,280
and say that if the food from said truck

507
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
had been given away for free,

508
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,680
that would have been mentioned in the question, right?

509
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,480
So I'm going to assume that this wasn't like,

510
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,080
oh, the chief paid for lunch for everybody or whatever.

511
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,600
No, there's a food truck here

512
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
and they're selling their food

513
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
and you can come and get it.

514
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,280
But this is clearly a function.

515
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,520
This is clearly a firefighter function.

516
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,600
But what's the harm in?

517
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
Yeah, it's a business.

518
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,560
It's a business.

519
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,800
They do want to make money.

520
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,240
Now here's where I would feel bad

521
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
if we're being honest.

522
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,760
I hopped last in line thinking like,

523
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,720
well, I'll go last

524
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
and then some other firefighters line up behind me

525
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,640
and they're waiting behind me.

526
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
Do I need to rotate back

527
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,440
and stay in the back of the line?

528
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,800
Cause I'm not a firefighter.

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
I don't think so.

530
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

531
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
Or else you're not going to get your great,

532
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,360
you know, kimchi fries

533
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
or whatever it is that you're getting

534
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
from this food truck.

535
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
Honesty, I wouldn't.

536
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,800
I wouldn't do it.

537
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,080
Well, no.

538
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
But I'm afraid of firefighters.

539
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,820
Yeah.

540
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
I wouldn't do it

541
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,120
because I'm afraid of doing the wrong thing in public.

542
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,620
Yeah.

543
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,580
Yeah.

544
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,380
So I would worry that I would get up there

545
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,060
and someone somewhere on earth might think,

546
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,180
well, he shouldn't do that.

547
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,500
And then I would melt into the ground and die.

548
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,540
And that's what I need to avoid.

549
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,340
With a food truck,

550
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,700
there's always the concern

551
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,060
that you hand them the money

552
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,620
and then they just drive away.

553
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,180
Yeah.

554
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,140
Fuck, that's happened to me

555
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,580
so many times where I go,

556
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,780
I'm like, oh, a nice gooey burger.

557
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,420
I'll take one.

558
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,700
Here's $15.

559
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,300
Vroom, gone.

560
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,700
It's like every time.

561
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,500
Every time?

562
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,820
Yeah, I'm starting to think about it, guys.

563
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,300
I've never actually gotten food out of a truck.

564
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
They always take my money

565
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,140
and just drive right off.

566
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,180
You know what, Griffin?

567
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,460
Now that you mention it,

568
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,940
there's not as many food trucks here in Cincinnati.

569
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,660
Yeah.

570
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,780
But yeah, every time.

571
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,320
Huh.

572
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,860
They've got a new one called Bite Me.

573
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,660
It's a food truck

574
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,420
with Asian street food type stuff.

575
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,140
You got, wait,

576
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,980
you got food trucks in Huntington?

577
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,860
Well, sort of.

578
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,660
It was in Barborsville.

579
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,500
It was parked outside the Family Dollar

580
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
that used to be a Rite Aid, you know?

581
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,700
Glow Up.

582
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,580
I drove up there, right?

583
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,420
Because I wanted,

584
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
I saw on Facebook they were there

585
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,780
and they were moving around a lot.

586
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,860
So I was like, I'd love to try this truck.

587
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,060
So I get in the car

588
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,740
and I drive up with my family.

589
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,940
I put my family in the car.

590
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,900
Okay.

591
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,220
Okay.

592
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,780
That's your first mistake.

593
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,980
I drive up there.

594
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,860
I get my mask.

595
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,580
I think, well, you know,

596
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,460
we haven't had any sort of dining experiences

597
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,460
in terms of like sitting in a restaurant or anything

598
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,820
and I'm not going to sit in this truck,

599
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
but I feel like it's fairly safe for me

600
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,100
to roll up there with my mask,

601
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,340
get me some food, eat it in my car.

602
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,700
So I drove up there

603
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,740
and I go to the guy

604
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,420
and I walk up to the truck

605
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,580
and I'm kind of standing there

606
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,780
and he's kind of looking at me

607
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,780
and I'm kind of looking at him

608
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
and he's got a Legend of Korra t-shirt on.

609
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,580
That's not relevant.

610
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,180
Just, I want to get a little color in there.

611
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,900
Yeah.

612
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,540
And I'm kind of standing there like a dummy

613
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,060
and then eventually he's like,

614
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,220
as if he doesn't know why I'm there.

615
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,740
It just occurs to him

616
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,860
and he's like, sorry,

617
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,260
we are sold out of everything.

618
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,760
Oh.

619
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,780
And it's like, I am me.

620
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,380
So I'm instantly mortified

621
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,060
that I have bothered this person

622
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,420
who no longer has food.

623
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,780
So I start compulsively congratulating him

624
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,340
on such a successful sales day.

625
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,820
Normal.

626
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,540
That's wonderful.

627
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,660
I was just checking, you win.

628
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,860
I just had to stop by and say,

629
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,300
I heard that you did it

630
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,620
and I just wanted to confirm you did it.

631
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,540
He said, and then he said,

632
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,100
we won't be here next week

633
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,740
but we'll be here the week after that.

634
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,940
Now, I want to say two things

635
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,020
about this person's business strategy.

636
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
One, they did not tell me

637
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,220
where they would be next week.

638
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,020
So there's other places I can go to.

639
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,220
You saw my car.

640
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,180
It's five feet away.

641
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,820
Right.

642
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,940
He would not reveal to me

643
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,900
where he was going to be.

644
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,940
So it might have been

645
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,100
a secret firefighter only invitational

646
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
is the one thing I want to say.

647
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,540
The other thing I want to say is like,

648
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,780
when you ran out of food in your food truck

649
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,380
and you've told people

650
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,580
where your food truck is,

651
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,460
shouldn't you, at that point,

652
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,220
drive away to a different location?

653
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,580
Your restaurant is empty.

654
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,180
It's no longer a restaurant.

655
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,780
Now it's just a truck

656
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,020
with a picture of a walk on the outside.

657
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,460
Please drive away.

658
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,860
Please don't make me walk up to your empty truck.

659
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,460
That would be like me walking up to,

660
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,060
at that point, I'm walking up to any truck

661
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,420
and just expecting to be served.

662
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,220
You got food?

663
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,220
Hey, you got food?

664
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,100
Well, and here, Justin,

665
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,220
if I might suggest a food truck saves you.

666
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,140
Like if you're in a restaurant, right?

667
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
You have to wait for food supplies

668
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,340
to be delivered to you.

669
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,780
If you run out of food in your food truck,

670
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,660
might suggest driving to the store.

671
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:08,980
Yeah.

672
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,580
Just go get some more food

673
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,380
and then come back and keep making more money.

674
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,740
Do you think one of the toughest parts

675
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,340
of owning a food truck is investing

676
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,380
in a really good hiding place for your food truck?

677
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,260
Because you can't, you can't be able to,

678
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,700
people shouldn't be able to see it

679
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,940
if it's not, if you aren't slinging bergs.

680
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,140
So like you need, it's a truck, so it's big.

681
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,740
So like getting garage space for it

682
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,940
must be pretty tough.

683
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,100
You think it's just like a big tarp

684
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,380
that they throw over them?

685
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,660
I'll tell you what I do, Griffin.

686
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:42,980
Yeah.

687
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,500
Palm fronds.

688
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,740
Palm fronds.

689
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,700
Yep, yep.

690
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
That way, anyone comes by my house,

691
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,980
front of my house is just a big pile of palm fronds.

692
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,820
Nothing to see here, just some palm fronds.

693
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,500
That Korean barbecue truck is covered in palm fronds.

694
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,180
I'm not following the aesthetic, the theme.

695
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Justin, I want you to know, it really bothers me.

696
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,660
And I want to admit, I can't quite put a finger on it.

697
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
I don't know that you did anything wrong,

698
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,340
but something about getting in a car

699
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,700
to drive to a food truck is weird to me.

700
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,100
Yeah.

701
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Because I was under the impression

702
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,780
that the business model was such

703
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,220
that the reverse was true.

704
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,940
But if a food truck parks somewhere

705
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,020
and then says, you have to come to me,

706
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,140
I feel like maybe something has gone wrong.

707
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,380
I mean, you're not wrong.

708
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,980
But then if that's the case,

709
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,540
they've limited their audience

710
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,020
to a Venn diagram of family dollar employees

711
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,180
that would love a bon me on the go.

712
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,900
Yeah.

713
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,460
Which I'm not saying is zero,

714
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,220
but is that a sustainable business?

715
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,020
I don't know.

716
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,180
Well, then what about driving around,

717
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,020
maybe play some music from the top

718
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,460
to let people know you're coming.

719
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,500
Now we're talking.

720
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,100
And you just run out of your front door

721
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,900
and get a bon me.

722
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,820
Do you want bon mes?

723
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,100
They're so crunchy, crunchy, green.

724
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,860
Now go on.

725
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,100
I don't know that I can do this again.

726
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,380
We have pork flavor and have tofu queen.

727
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,220
Okay, was there a comment here?

728
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,260
Important question.

729
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,500
Yeah.

730
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,820
We got tofu queen.

731
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,500
That was a sort of interjection.

732
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
An interjectory queen.

733
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,980
I'm tired of giving away free money

734
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
to other businesses that don't deserve it.

735
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,380
I want to make some money for our business.

736
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,340
That deserves it.

737
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,860
That deserves it.

738
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,020
Because we're promising young people.

739
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,900
And we're doing our best.

740
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,780
And we don't have a truck.

741
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,980
Listen, if I could drive around

742
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,740
in a truck and podcast, I would.

743
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,980
I mean, fucking Alex Jones seems to have figured it out.

744
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:50,580
Let's go to the money's up.

745
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,180
Squarespace, deal with it.

746
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,380
Oh, shit.

747
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,740
Yeah, I'm sick and tired of being nice.

748
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,500
And it's time to get real.

749
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,780
You want a website.

750
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,060
You don't have a website.

751
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,140
You don't even know how to make a website.

752
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,060
Squarespace knows how to make websites

753
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,820
and they will help you make one.

754
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
You could showcase your work,

755
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,180
sell products and services of all kinds,

756
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,260
and promote your physical online business.

757
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,460
It's 2020.

758
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,780
How many times do I have to tell you about Squarespace

759
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,020
before you get off your duff

760
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,980
and then put your duff down in front of a computer

761
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,500
and go to Squarespace

762
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,060
while your duff rests comfortably in a chair?

763
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,580
That way you can get to Squarespace's

764
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,180
beautiful customizable templates

765
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,020
created by world-class designers.

766
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,420
Everything optimized for mobile right out of the box,

767
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,580
analytics to help you grow in real time,

768
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,780
free and secure hosting,

769
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,700
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

770
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,940
And then once you've built your website,

771
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,220
pick your duff back up,

772
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,540
move it back over to where it was,

773
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,580
maybe the couch?

774
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,620
I don't know.

775
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,900
And then sit and wait for a new season

776
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,500
of your favorite TV show.

777
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,580
I'm gonna say Mindhunter.

778
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,140
I don't know.

779
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,300

783
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,260
Then go on Twitter

784
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,340
and let's talk about the new season of Mindhunter.

785
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
Travis is really lonely out here.

786
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,940
I don't even know if there is a new season of Mindhunter.

787
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,540
I don't know when it's coming out.

788
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,100
I could have said-

789
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,500
I don't even know what Mindhunter is a hundred percent.

790
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,540
I know!

791
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,300
Groff's in it, I think.

792
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,340
I think the Groff's in it.

793
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,660
And I could have said Supernatural

794
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,420
and instead I said Mindhunter.

795
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,700
Dude, I'm kicking myself.

796
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,180
I do appreciate adding a little spice travel variety

797
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,260
to what is typically a sort of supernatural stew

798
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,660
that you cook up week in, week out on this podcast.

799
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,660
Quip also is sponsoring this episode

800
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,260
and they have electric toothbrushes.

801
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,140
Hell yeah.

802
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,100
Yeah, fuck yeah.

803
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,020
I feel like we're coming at the listeners

804
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,340
pretty hot and heavy in this ad break.

805
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,740
You know what?

806
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,340
Sometimes they need a fire under their doves, Griffin.

807
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,700
Talk about the doves a lot.

808
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,300
Show me your fucking teeth.

809
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,420
Whoa.

810
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,900
Show me those fucking hobgoblin teeth.

811
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,980
Okay, now you're getting mean.

812
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,500
Pop out your grill.

813
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,620
Let's see them.

814
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,120
Ew!

815
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,700
No, Griffin-

816
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,020
You need to clean those.

817
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,620
No, you're trying to energize, Griffin.

818
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,460
Not like insult.

819
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,420
Oh, let me try.

820
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,100
Let me see your fucking teeth.

821
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,740
Whoa.

822
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,980
All right, all right, all right.

823
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,500
Well, you need to maintain those

824
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,300
using equip a smart electric toothbrush

825
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,220
because they've gamified oral hygiene

826
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,980
in a really fun way

827
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,700
because they've got a new smart electric toothbrush

828
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,100
that can get you great perks

829
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,940
as you form good brushing habits.

830
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,060
Things like free products, gift cards, and more.

831
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,580
And there's a smart brush.

832
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,660
It's for adults and kids

833
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,780
that connects to the Quip app via Bluetooth

834
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,300
and it tracks how well you brush

835
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,780
and you can get tips on-

836
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,980
More like white tooth.

837
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,020
Sorry?

838
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,780
More like white tooth.

839
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,340
Say again?

840
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,620
More like white tooth.

841
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,420
Because it'll turn-

842
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,460
Because yeah, sure.

843
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,740
Yeah, absolutely, Trav.

844
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,220
Thank you.

845
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,260
You get it.

846
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,580

847
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,460

848
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,820

852
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,500

I know, right?

864
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,540
I'm very excited.

865
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,780
Yeah, my dentist is gonna be fucking psyched.

866
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,860
Video games, video games, video games.

867
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,500
You like them?

868
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,260
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

869
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,940
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

870
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,660
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

871
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,900
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

872
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,380
It's a podcast about video games.

873
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,140
A podcast about video games?

874
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,500
But I don't have time for that.

875
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,460
Sure you do.

876
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,540

888
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,880
Bye.

889
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:55,020
I want to munch.

890
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,760
Squad.

891
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,340
I want to munch.

892
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,840
Squad.

893
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,340
Do host.

894
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:58,840
Munch.

Munch host.

896
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,840
Do host.

897
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,340
We scuffle.

898
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,840
Munch.

899
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,380
The Welcome Munch Squad.

900
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
It's a radio show.

901
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,880
A radio show.

902
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,180
And it's a radio show.

903
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,420
And it's a radio show.

904
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,900
And it's a radio show.

905
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,900
The Welcome Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast,

906
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,700
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

907
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,540
Sunset, it's sunset years.

908
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,980
Yeah, sunsetting, I believe.

909
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,540
Yeah, it's in the twilight years of this bit

910
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,420
until I come up with a better bit,

911
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,260
which you wouldn't think would be that hard,

912
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,740
but here we are.

913
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,180
KFC is gonna introduce new signature dipping sauce

914
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,740
nationwide on October 12th.

915
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,900
And as the crow flies, my friend,

916
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,880
that is possibly the day you're listening to this.

917
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,620
Kentucky Fried Chicken announced Thursday

918
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,260
that it is launching a new signature dipping sauce

919
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,260
that's sure to make fried chicken fans rejoice.

920
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,700
Introducing KFC sauce.

921
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,780
That's a signature sauce that's tangy and sweet

922
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,180
with a bit of smokiness specifically designed

923
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,540
to pair with crispy tenders.

924
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,900
It kind of seems like they threw a lot of flavor words

925
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,980
in there, huh?

926
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,820
That's great.

927
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,040
You get umami, umami and umami mixed up in there, I like it.

928
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,180
When we set out to create a new signature sauce,

929
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,460
we went right to the experts, our customers, to find out.

930
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,980
Now hold on, I've eaten at KFC

931
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,980
and I'll tell you right now, I am not.

932
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,460
You're a fucking tourist.

933
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,500
Don't call yourself a KFC customer.

934
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,300
Well, there was a time in my younger years.

935
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,460
Oh boy, oh boy.

936
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,020
We went to our customers to find out

937
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,260
what made a sauce best in class for dipping.

938
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,020
It needs to be viscous.

939
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,420
Yeah, it can't be so wet

940
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,780
that it just runs right off the tender.

941
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,520
But also not too solid.

942
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,700
I wanna be able to put the tender in.

943
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,500
The tender has to be able to enter the spicy liquid.

944
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,980
It is weird to think that dipping,

945
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,060
the physical act of dipping was the primary concern,

946
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,420
not the eating that would follow.

947
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,260
No, no, no, that's secondary.

948
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,220
If you get that primary thing wrong

949
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,020
and you either can't get the tender in there

950
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,940
or the tender don't pick nothing up,

951
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,020
well, after that, friend,

952
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
what it tastes like don't mean nothing.

953
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,740
That's from Andrea Zachiminsky,

954
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,380
the chief marketing officer of KFC US.

955
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,220
You know what?

956
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,340
A lot of times they put the chief marketing officer

957
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,540
in these things and I kind of find that frustrating

958
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,560
because their whole job is to sell stuff,

959
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,100
so how can I know I can trust them?

960
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,300
Yeah, right.

961
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,260
Give me the head of R&D.

962
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,660
Yeah, I want an impartial person

963
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,620
that doesn't care if I eat it or not to bring me my news.

964
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,940
You know, just trying to get me to eat it.

965
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,480
I wanna know what flavors they tried to put in the sauce

966
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
but couldn't quite make it work.

967
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,060
I wanna know their shortcomings.

968
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,220
Well, our first idea was chicken flavored sauce.

969
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,040
We figured let's enhance it,

970
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,740
so we just ground up a bunch of chicken.

971
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,540
It's just like eating the chicken you know,

972
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,780
it's that much wetter.

973
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,380
But then the problem was people just slurped the sauce

974
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,320
and they left the salad chicken alone

975
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,460
and we said this is too dangerous for any one man to have.

976
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,980
They came in and said they don't want the chicken anymore.

977
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,220
They just want the sauce.

978
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,300
It was too powerful.

979
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,820
We buried it in a bunker underneath our HQ

980
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,020
where it shall remain and be studied by top men.

981
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,300
Until Rick and Morty does a fucking hysterical

982
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,340
chicken sauce episode.

983
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,740
Andrea continued, we went through 50 iterations

984
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,420
and the response to this recipe was overwhelming.

985
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,220
I'm assuming that response was

986
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,120
please stop making me eat this fucking sauce.

987
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,980
Just let me see my family.

988
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,460
Let me sleep for fuck's sake.

989
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,080
It's been 10 days.

990
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,900
Beginning October 12th in all KFC US restaurants.

991
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,580
What a logistical effort this is.

992
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,460
Fried chicken dipping fans, which apparently exists,

993
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,500
can enjoy the new signature KFC sauce

994
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,180
along with a newly revamped core sauce lineup

995
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,200
of classic ranch, honey BBQ, and honey mustard

996
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,220
in addition to KFC hot sauce.

997
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
Oh, thank God.

998
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,140
I was afraid you weren't gonna say the hot sauce, you know?

999
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,440
Yeah.

1000
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,620
Those who love dipping do indeed take sauces seriously.

1001
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,960
Some going so far as to deem chicken an edible spoon

1002
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,620
for sauce or a vessel for flavor.

1003
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,980
That's a fucking sentence from this rest release.

1004
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,100
I kid you not.

1005
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,440
Hey, why did you guys stop hanging out with Derek?

1006
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,820
Oh, you'll never believe the bullshit he said.

1007
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,140
I know you know Derek says a lot of bullshit,

1008
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,740
but the other day we were eating fried chicken

1009
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,100
and he said yum yum edible spoon vessel flavor

1010
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,540
flavor vessel and I had to get the fuck out of there

1011
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
as fast as I could and get the kids out.

1012
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,620
I left Jean there.

1013
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,780
I haven't seen her since.

1014
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,140
I don't know what happened to her.

1015
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,540
I miss my wife.

1016
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,940
I'm so scared.

1017
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,860
For many, forgetting the sauce is a meal ruiner.

1018
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,580
In a recent survey from DoorDash, 75% of Americans

1019
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,940
say their meal is ruined if the sauces are forgotten.

1020
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,180
Oh boy.

1021
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,420
And 20% say sauce is the single most important part

1022
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,260
of a great fried chicken meal.

1023
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,660
Okay, sometimes I just get a bag of sauce.

1024
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,940
Can you imagine being put into a position

1025
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,300
where you, a human being on the Earth,

1026
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,160
has to try to come up with an opinion about

1027
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,040
the most important part of a great fried chicken meal?

1028
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,900
Yeah, it's the chicken.

1029
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,740
Everybody's the chicken.

1030
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,220
The flavor of the chicken and how good it tastes to eat it.

1031
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,160
Let me, okay, listen.

1032
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,560
I like dipping.

1033
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,060
I don't know who the profile of this person is.

1034
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,860
I don't know who this person is who's like,

1035
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,420
oh, why do I get a fried chicken?

1036
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,860
Thank you so much for asking.

1037
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,420
I like to put it into things.

1038
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,060
Yeah, I like how it's a spoon you can eat

1039
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,380
and I'm a dirt bag.

1040
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,940
Luckily for those who love dipping,

1041
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,220
KFC's extra crispy TM tenders

1042
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,040
are perfectly designed for dipping

1043
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,540
in the sense that they're edible and physical.

1044
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,660
They're perfectly designed for dipping

1045
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,260
and elevate the overall sauce experience.

1046
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,380
The hills and valleys created by KFC's extra crispy breading

1047
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,260
form little lakes of sauce on every tender,

1048
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,780
making the final bite crispy, crunchy,

1049
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
and bursting with flavor.

1050
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,060
And you know, if you're eating KFC,

1051
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,140
it may very well be the final bite, period.

1052
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,980
So who knows?

1053
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,820
The wild topography of these crunchy boys.

1054
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,660
What's that?

1055
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,140
Oh, it's a hidden cavern full of delicious sauce.

1056
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,500
Oh, and a dragon's gold.

1057
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm Sir David Attenborough.

1058
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,660
Observe the gazelle as it gallops

1059
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,700
through the different nooks and crannies to celebrate.

1060
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,180
This is, it is amazing at this point of this press release

1061
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,740
and I'm not even to the part that I was really excited about.

1062
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,260
To celebrate its new signature KFC sauce,

1063
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,780
KFC's head chef, Chris Scott,

1064
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,780
created three KFC charcuterie recipes.

1065
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,820
Oh boy.

1066
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,340
Yes, I was waiting for it.

1067
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,620
So far I was like, this is informative and interesting,

1068
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,960
but not that wild.

1069
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,400
Where's the actionable part?

1070
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,700
Where's the part that I can do at home?

1071
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,420
Well, good news from chef Chris Scott.

1072
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,460
Who under duress developed these recipes.

1073
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Yeah, he has as terms of his resignation

1074
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,020
created as his final act.

1075
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,340
Who upon the KFC submitting his charcuterie recipes

1076
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,540
was handed a vial of the anti-toxin for his family.

1077
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,720
He printed it on the back of his resignation letter.

1078
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,640
They're KFC charcuterie, it doesn't trip off the top,

1079
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,500
but you get the idea, right?

1080
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,040
KFC charcuterie.

1081
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,000
Bored recipes, you can try it at home.

1082
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,120
Charcuterie doesn't have to be all cold cuts,

1083
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,440
cheeses and crackers.

1084
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,280
Sure.

1085
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,960
It can also be delicious comfort foods

1086
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,800
like extra crispy tenders,

1087
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,040
secret recipe fries and indulgent sauces.

1088
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,200
That's just a meal.

1089
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,680
That's one of Colonel Sanders' standard meals.

1090
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,160
You know, charcuterie doesn't have to be meat and cheese.

1091
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,320
Sometimes you can just be a bowl of oatmeal.

1092
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,300
Sometimes you can be a child's laughter.

1093
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,680
Or just some loose grass you picked up from the ground

1094
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,960
and sprinkled on someone's car.

1095
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,560
Charcuterie doesn't have to be all cold cuts.

1096
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,000
It can be watching half of episode two

1097
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,080
in your hotel room while you're drunk.

1098
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,920
It can be anything.

1099
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,800
It can be a fucking Toyota Yaris.

1100
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,920
Get out of here.

1101
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,120
They are both fun to create and to eat.

1102
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,520
And I know around my house, we are definitely in need

1103
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,540
of some creative ways to break up the monotony

1104
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,380
of meals at home.

1105
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,220
Oh boy.

1106
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,040
Okay.

1107
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,880
Oh, my fucking kids.

1108
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,720
So we're baking KFC charcuterie.

1109
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,440
Oh, my fucking kids.

1110
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,760
Oh, my partner.

1111
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, it's so fucking boring.

1112
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,600
Please, KFC.

1113
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,500
The process and assembly of a charcuterie board

1114
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,600
have become a creative outlet for many

1115
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,560
and has recently become a social media phenomenon.

1116
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,560
On TikTok, videos associated with the hashtag

1117
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,800
hashtag charcuterie have been viewed

1118
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,800
more than 224.8 million times.

1119
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,400
And many popular charcuterie creators

1120
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,240
have gained notoriety for their elaborate

1121
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,480
and mouthwatering creations.

1122
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,140
You know what I'm going on TikTok right now?

1123
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,080
If you see, Trav, Trav, Trav.

1124
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,320
If you see anyone doing a funny Fortnite dance on there,

1125
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,560
you make sure to let me know.

1126
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,900
I'm not seeing any KFC yet.

1127
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,000
Okay, let me just scroll down.

1128
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,680
Oh, Fortnite dance.

1129
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,600
Yeah, which one?

1130
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,960
I'll tell you, what I did see before I saw KFC

1131
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,160
was somebody making a McDonald's charcuterie board

1132
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,720
and it looks like they figured that one out

1133
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,560
all on their own without any recipes.

1134
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,680
They didn't need a press release or anything.

1135
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,200
Huh, here's a Chick-fil-A charcuterie board.

1136
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,560
Oh, no.

1137
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,960
What's on that?

1138
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,140
Chick-fil-A food.

1139
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,720
And a little New Testament.

1140
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,240
I wish it was easier to keep track

1141
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,960
of whether or not it was permissible

1142
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,440
to eat Chick-fil-A at any given moment.

1143
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,120
Just go ahead and assume no.

1144
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,160
Yeah, that's a safe assumption, isn't it?

1145
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,800
One easy way to remember how to find this podcast

1146
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,800
is just go to kfcrcuterie.com and you're going to find

1147
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,840
that I fucking snagged it from them.

1148
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,680
No, you know what?

1149
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,360
I'm gonna make it redirect to Bojangles.

1150
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,000
I just decided that instead. Oh my God, Justin.

1151
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,080
I'm gonna do that, or Zaxby's.

1152
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,080
No, you know what?

1153
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,240
Zaxby's. Okay.

1154
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,400
That's what I'm gonna do.

1155
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Let's see, the charcuteries are the KFC Little Dipper,

1156
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,880
a snackable combination of KFC Extra Crispy Chicken Tenders,

1157
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,960
secret recipe fries

1158
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,760
paired with your favorite dipping sauces.

1159
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,840
So that's just- A meal.

1160
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,680
A meal. A meal.

1161
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,180
From KFC. And with a Sprite on the side.

1162
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,180
So there's also the Kentucky Game Night Trio.

1163
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,020
That's Kentucky Fried Buffalo Wings,

1164
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,160
KFC Extra Crispy Tenders, and secret recipe fries

1165
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,600
complemented by KFC sauce and grocery items

1166
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,920
like blue cheese, fresh celery, and more.

1167
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,120
It's an admission that with a little bit of work

1168
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,280
and some products from your local grocery store,

1169
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,640
you could make this palatable.

1170
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,360
Listen, we've talked a lot of shit about KFC,

1171
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,160
but KFC, if you want to partner with me

1172
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,200
for like a Travis McElroy meal,

1173
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,500
like Travis McElroy, he's pretty cool.

1174
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,320
And we're gonna make a meal that is,

1175
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,040
this is what Travis McElroy eats when he comes to KFC.

1176
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,380
I will happily do that.

1177
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,560
I will do that. Please, this isn't-

1178
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,960
You have not had the legwork on Yum Brands, Travis.

1179
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,880
I don't know how to tell you this,

1180
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,420
but you have not done the kind of research

1181
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,920
into Yum Brands that you would need to.

1182
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,680
Oh, are you saying you have?

1183
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,760
To commit to something like that.

1184
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,100
Oh, are they- Wait, Justin.

1185
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,940
Are they shitheads?

1186
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,780
Everybody is.

1187
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,740
Oh, man.

1188
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,580
Twist.

1189
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,800
Ugh.

1190
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,400
So that's the scoop on the KFC charcuterie.

1191
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,480
You can make that at home.

1192
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,440
I guess what they're saying,

1193
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,920
what they're really saying with this,

1194
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,720
if I could just be so bold,

1195
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,520
what they're really saying with this is put it on a plate.

1196
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,360
Yeah. Put it on a plate

1197
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,800
and you'll feel better about how things are going.

1198
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,160
A wooden plate.

1199
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,080
Maybe, and this is gonna mean different things

1200
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,440
to different people, arrange it.

1201
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,960
Okay.

1202
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,600
Interesting. Speak on that.

1203
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,800
What I would do- Travis, just explain

1204
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,520
how to do that in a way that screams class.

1205
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,880
I would take the tenders and kind of do them

1206
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,160
in like an alternating like log tower,

1207
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,380
like you would perhaps Jenga, maybe.

1208
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,920
Oh, that's gonna look real good.

1209
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,640
And then just pour the sauce down the middle.

1210
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,340
So it fills it up.

1211
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,660
Okay. That's funny, Trav.

1212
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,900
Yeah, and then put a little roof on top of it

1213
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,480
and then maybe sprinkle it.

1214
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,080
I don't know how this will work with it,

1215
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,720
but like with icing sugar,

1216
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,560
so it looks like a snowy wonderland

1217
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,520
and then maybe add some little marshmallow snowmen,

1218
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,160
maybe glue some M&Ms on there, a little Santa Claus.

1219
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,240
What were we talking about?

1220
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,760
I was about to ask a question, unless Griffin has a Yahoo.

1221
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,980
Yeah, I mean, gosh, we should address this one.

1222
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,560
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

1223
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,400
Thanks, Graham.

1224
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1225
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,200
who I am gonna call them.

1226
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,500
Denise asks,

1227
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,500
how can I make my dad like corn?

1228
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,760
Oh, Griffin, C or K.

1229
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,920
C or K, C or K, C or K.

1230
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
It's a C.

1231
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,820
Oh, okay.

1232
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,660
All right.

1233
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,660
Good, my 100% dad's like corn theory still holds.

1234
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,000
With a K, right?

1235
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,840
Yes, thank you.

1236
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,760
We need to be able to,

1237
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,380
it is so fucked up that these two,

1238
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,680
I'm trying to teach Henry the phonetic alphabet

1239
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,640
and it's so fucked up that these two letters

1240
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,520
do the same fucking thing.

1241
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,440
It's the same thing.

1242
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,280
It's pointless.

1243
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,220
Get rid of one of them.

1244
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,680
Make them fight in the winter.

1245
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,160
I think C should get to stay

1246
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,840
because C can do a lot of other stuff.

1247
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,680
K is always-

1248
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,480
Oh, no, see, what I would say, Griffin,

1249
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,480
what needs to happen is C needs to stay in its lane.

1250
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,720
Stick with that, well, I guess that it's the S sound.

1251
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,880
We have an S for that too.

1252
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,760
We got the S sound, see?

1253
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,120
Maybe get rid of the C.

1254
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,280
We have the K and the S.

1255
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,520
They are doing their individualized jobs.

1256
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,600
Okay, anyway.

1257
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,520
Okay.

1258
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
What if we just started pronouncing the band's name

1259
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,200
C-Horn.

1260
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,520
C-Horn.

1261
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,360
C-Horn.

1262
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,560
Help this person.

1263
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,800
How do they make their dad like corn?

1264
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,620
Play him some corn while they're eating corn.

1265
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,360
I want you to hear the difference.

1266
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,680
Okay, there's a lot of great ways

1267
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,400
I can tell you how to cook corn.

1268
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,320
Because if I say it wrong and say,

1269
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,900
I like to eat corn, then I'm going to jail.

1270
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,820
Okay, there's lots of good ways to make corn.

1271
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,780
For me, for my money, nice elote.

1272
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,020
Now I'll eat that, I'll eat that.

1273
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,860
But I'll eat it on the cob.

1274
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,340
I like me a cornbread.

1275
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,180
Corn, okay.

1276
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,200
It's sweet.

1277
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,040
You know what I like?

1278
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,860
Cornbread, you put some broccoli in there.

1279
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,780
It's really great.

1280
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,980
I don't think we can extrapolate quite that far, Trav.

1281
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,340
Because I think you could say like,

1282
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,580
well, there's corn syrup in your airheads

1283
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,340
that you love to eat.

1284
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,180
No, I understand that, Griffin.

1285
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,180
But I'm saying cornbread, corn like tortillas,

1286
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,600
like these things, your corn flakes,

1287
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,420
these are pretty corn direct.

1288
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,840
You know what I mean?

1289
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,640
It's like saying you don't like eggs,

1290
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,520
where there are so many different versions of eggs.

1291
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,400
It's hard for me to believe that.

1292
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,080
Justin, you got anything on this one?

1293
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,840
I have a really good Mexican street corn empanada

1294
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,340
at Nomada, that bakery in Huntington.

1295
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,980
Yeah.

1296
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,260
That would be a great place

1297
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,420
because there it's served up on a little,

1298
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,660
first off, it's vegetarian.

1299
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,500
Gotta love that.

1300
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,240
And also it's served up,

1301
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,140
there's just like eight pieces of corn on it, really.

1302
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,900
So it's kind of like you wouldn't even,

1303
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,020
it's like I do with my kids.

1304
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,620
Like you didn't even know you were eating corn.

1305
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,220
Oh, it's not inside the empanada?

1306
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,060
It might be.

1307
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,420
It might be hidden from me.

1308
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,260
I don't know.

1309
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,080
See, you gotta watch that.

1310
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,340
But I can see there's visible corn.

1311
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,100
If your dad thinks you're tricking him,

1312
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,920
oh God, dads hate that.

1313
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,760
No, they hate me.

1314
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,060
I do not like deception of any sort.

1315
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,260
I remember one time,

1316
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,540
my daddy was eating a cake that I made him

1317
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,180
and he was just about to take a bite

1318
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,420
and then he peeled the layers apart

1319
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,260
and he found a piece of broccoli in there.

1320
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,500
And he didn't talk to me for two weeks.

1321
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,140
I would tell you that happened to me in school

1322
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,620
where everybody was doing like science fair projects

1323
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,460
or something like that.

1324
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,660
And then one girl came in and gave everybody brownies

1325
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,620
and we all ate the brownies.

1326
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,200
And she was like, did you like them?

1327
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,420
They were all made out of green peppers.

1328
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,340
And I wanted to be like, hey,

1329
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,980
one of us could have been wicked allergic to green peppers.

1330
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,780
Pretty risky gamble you just did there, Katie.

1331
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,620
Damn.

1332
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,600
Also, gross.

1333
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,180
Get my fucking permission.

1334
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,520
Green pepper is my least favorite vegetable.

1335
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,360
And I do not like-

1336
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,580
No, you don't mean that.

1337
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,340
I do not like psychically the idea that I liked it.

1338
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,180
You know what I mean?

1339
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,660
I'm not willing to change my mind about that, Katie.

1340
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,500
Okay.

1341
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,340
What is your least favorite vegetable, everybody?

1342
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,740
My least favorite?

1343
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,180
What's your least favorite vegetable?

1344
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,500
I think a lima bean.

1345
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
It's hard to choose,

1346
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,980
because by and large, not good.

1347
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,820
Not good.

1348
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,640
That's not true.

1349
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
I love those green things, man.

1350
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,860
They make me feel powerful and strong.

1351
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,240
I think peas are like corn's evil nephew

1352
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,560
and they taste so gross.

1353
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,560
And they have the texture of the casing never quite goes away.

1354
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,020
It sucks, man.

1355
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,960
You don't want to hear about my least favorite.

1356
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,020
I want to know Justin's least favorite vegetable.

1357
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,560
French cut green beans.

1358
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,220
I think they're fucking vulgar.

1359
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,420
I want to talk about,

1360
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,540
when we're talking about vegetables,

1361
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,500
I found a new one that I liked this week.

1362
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,340
Oh boy.

1363
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,260
This is a story from my life.

1364
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,580
People are always asking us to share

1365
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,940
more stories from our lives.

1366
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,060
Yeah, we stay on topic too much.

1367
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,900
It's true.

1368
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,620
It's a story that happened to me this week.

1369
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,060
Blue Apron, you know I love Blue Apron.

1370
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,900
Yeah.

1371
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,320
There was a recipe this week or last week,

1372
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,500
I can't remember now,

1373
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,620
but cause time is meaningless.

1374
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,380
And it had, sometimes Blue Apron does this to me

1375
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,300
where they'll get me hooked on a new ingredient.

1376
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,100
And I'm like, whoa, I'm wild about this stuff.

1377
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,340
I can't get that in my house.

1378
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,180
No.

1379
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,000
They don't have it here.

1380
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,900
And this time it was delicata squash.

1381
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,100
Oh yeah.

1382
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,820
Was this the butter chicken and squash?

1383
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,300
Oh yes it was.

1384
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,140
Yeah it was.

1385
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,460
This delicata squash, it roasted up so good.

1386
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,880
Oh my golly.

1387
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,580
I was wild about this stuff.

1388
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,460
So then I'm putting it in an order at the grocery store

1389
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,620
and I searched delicata squash

1390
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,500
and it doesn't surprise me that they don't have it.

1391
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,580
In fact, the website crashed.

1392
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,700
One thing that they did have was an assortment

1393
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,900
of five squashes in a bag.

1394
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,700
So I bought that and then it showed up

1395
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,700
and I somehow missed the part on the listing for the item

1396
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,540
or maybe it wasn't there, I don't know,

1397
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,780
where it said decorative, decorative squashes.

1398
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,980
So then I got a problem.

1399
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,180
My problem is one of them kind of looks like a small

1400
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,860
delicata squash, kind of like I ate before.

1401
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,220
And I don't want, they're real squashes,

1402
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,100
but I don't want to be, so now I'm like,

1403
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,500
could I hook you guys up and eat you?

1404
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,500
But I don't want to be the guy that goes to the hospital

1405
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,500
for eating something that like fucking says decorative

1406
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,860
on the bag.

1407
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,860
So fast forward, I'm now the kind of guy who has,

1408
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,700
we're the kind of household that has a bowl

1409
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,180
with a bunch of squash in it

1410
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,340
to celebrate the season arriving.

1411
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,540
And I was wondering how that happened.

1412
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,580
How does that happen to you?

1413
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,620
That you just end up like,

1414
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,620
I gotta get some decorative squash for the season arriving.

1415
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,220
And this is how it happened to me.

1416
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,060
Maybe they'll stick around and not go bad, I don't know.

1417
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,940
They're decorative.

1418
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,260
Or maybe in a moment of temptation, you will eat them.

1419
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,220
Justin, I don't think you realize

1420
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,820
the bigger revelation right now is that in your house,

1421
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,060
you have vegetables and foodstuffs that are good for eating.

1422
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,660
And then this special like Wilbur and Charlotte's Web,

1423
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,780
like these gourds have been given a reprieve.

1424
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,020
This is, what you've got here is you have a fish

1425
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,460
in a goldfish bowl, while over here,

1426
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,300
you're making some tilapia for dinner, right?

1427
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,820
You have pet betta fish at the Red Lobster restaurant

1428
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,340
you work at is fucked up.

1429
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,340
Those gourds have to watch you eat vegetables.

1430
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,900
Better than the alternative though, isn't it?

1431
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,940
Well, yeah, but it kind of seems like you're saying,

1432
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,860
don't fuck up gourds, this could be you.

1433
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,700
Gourds stay in line.

1434
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,020
Or I'm saying to my other vegetables,

1435
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,060
be more beautiful and seasonal.

1436
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,940
You know, every vegetable is decorative

1437
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,420
depending on what you're into.

1438
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,860
That's what I'm saying.

1439
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,140
This is what is so challenging to me.

1440
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,020
Do you want me to not eat these gourds?

1441
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,340
You have to say not for,

1442
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,940
that also doesn't say not for eating.

1443
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,860
It doesn't say recommended decorative.

1444
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,740
Right, exactly.

1445
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,940
I've got a farmer coming over tomorrow, gourds.

1446
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,420
And if I get the green light,

1447
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,860
you're going in a fucking casserole.

1448
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,980
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

1449
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1450
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,380
We sure have loved being here with you.

1451
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,340
I want to ask a quick favor of you.

1452
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,980
Well, Justin, before you do that,

1453
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,460
I want to ask you a quick favor

1454
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,500
because I want him to listen to one of my favorite podcasts.

1455
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,340
Oh my God.

1456
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,340
A podcast called The Besties.

1457
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,180
Tell me about it.

1458
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,940
I listen to it, no joke, every week.

1459
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,020
It is my brothers, Justin and Griffin,

1460
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,380
as well as Chris Plant and Rush Frustrick.

1461
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,380
And they talk about video games,

1462
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,140
but they talk about video games in such a way

1463
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,420
that I, a video game enthusiast

1464
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,100
that knows nothing about like current video games events,

1465
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,420
finds fascinating.

1466
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,220
They tell you about games that are coming out,

1467
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,540
things you'll be interested in that you've never heard of,

1468
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,420
plus great discussions about games that you love.

1469
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,220
And it's not just like tearing the games apart.

1470
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,460
It really teaches you about like the gaming industry,

1471
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,780
teaches you about the games that are coming out.

1472
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,500
There's so much going on now with the console wars,

1473
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,860
with the new generation of PlayStation 5

1474
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,100
and the next Xbox.

1475
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,500
And hearing you guys talk about it

1476
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,820
has made it make a lot of sense for me.

1477
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,340
I listen to it every week.

1478
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,180
And you know what?

1479
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,220
Even Bebe likes it

1480
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,660
because she thinks you guys are very funny.

1481
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,660
That's so nice.

1482
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,900
You can find it on Spotify.

1483
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,500
So go there, listen to it, subscribe.

1484
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,940
It's out every Friday.

1485
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,300
I do not miss an episode.

1486
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,340
Highly recommend it.

1487
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,900
Thanks, Travis. Thank you, Travis.

1488
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,740
You're welcome.

1489
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,500
I don't have anything anymore.

1490
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,940
Oh, what were you gonna say?

1491
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,980
You stole my thing.

1492
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,340
Oh, you were gonna talk about your own podcast?

1493
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,380
Goosh.

1494
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,220
Goosh.

1495
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,220
The Avengers and Crystal Kingdom

1496
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,900
is now available for pre-order.

1497
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,780
That is a graphic novel based on the arc of the podcast.

1498
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,820
Yeah.

1499
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,540
We did it again.

1500
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,580
TheAvengersZoneComic.com.

1501
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,860
That's coming July 13th, 2020.

1502
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,700
One.

1503
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,820
2021.

1504
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,820
One.

1505
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,660
The future.

1506
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,740
And I believe I have personally guaranteed

1507
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,740
in other venues, and I will do so here,

1508
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,220
that you will be able to enjoy that graphic novel

1509
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,580
in a crowd of people and all will be safe.

1510
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,820
That was a big cold shot for old Justin.

1511
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,620
A big cold shot from me.

1512
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,340
Oh, he's pointing at the stands

1513
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,180
where there's lots of people sitting close together.

1514
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,340
We got some new merch out.

1515
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,980
If you haven't gone to McElroyMerch.com

1516
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,060
and checked it out, you should.

1517
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,740
We got a new pin of the month

1518
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,820
that is based on the phrase Tiger on the Table,

1519
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,620
designed by Sam Schultz.

1520
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,340
And the proceeds from that benefit

1521
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,940
the Marshall P. Johnson Institute,

1522
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,980
which defends and protects the human rights

1523
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,500
of black transgender and gender nonconforming people,

1524
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,340
as well as the Sylvia Rivera Law Project,

1525
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,540
which works to guarantee that all people are free

1526
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,380
to determine their gender identity and expression.

1527
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,300
We also have a new Candle Nights ornament

1528
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,580
by Lynn Doyle that is super cute,

1529
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,900
as well as a Candle Nights wrapping paper by Justin Gray,

1530
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,020
and this little jump scare pin of Justin

1531
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,940
doing the jump scare from the TV show.

1532
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,980
It's so good.

1533
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,820
McElroyMerch.com.

1534
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,980
Also, speaking of books and things you can order,

1535
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,580
we wrote a how-to podcast book

1536
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,300
called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You,

1537
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,980
and it's available for pre-order now

1538
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,820
at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

1539
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,060
We are working this week,

1540
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,020
we are recording the audio book,

1541
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,380
and we're narrating it,

1542
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,460
and let me see, just reading again,

1543
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,380
it's pretty funny.

1544
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,180
I'm having a really good time reading it.

1545
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,660
And I think you will too.

1546
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,340
It comes out in January.

1547
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,540
Pre-order it now, and in January,

1548
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,980
you can learn to make a podcast that you're proud of

1549
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,700
and enjoy reading a book.

1550
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,340
It's two things in one.

1551
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,700
Did you mention that we now have a thanks for vibing

1552
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,540
and keeping it tight?

1553
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,380
Sure.

1554
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,260
Do we?

1555
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,220
Is that up?

1556
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,420
Yeah, that's new.

1557
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,260
Check that out too.

1558
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,580
McElroyMerch, and then pre-order the book

1559
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,580
at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

1560
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,500
That is a funny situation because we didn't say that.

1561
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,660
It was on a Jumbotron,

1562
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,500
so we had to reach out to the person

1563
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,060
that said that funny thing in a Jumbotron

1564
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,620
to ask them if it was okay to make a T-shirt.

1565
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,060
And we told them we would give them money

1566
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,900
for the T-shirts and get this.

1567
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,420
They actually requested instead

1568
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,500
that a portion be donated to the Young Center

1569
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,860
for Immigrant Children's Rights.

1570
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,020
So what's up?

1571
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,940
Best fans in the world said it before.

1572
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,460
I will continue to say it.

1573
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,940
That's it, right?

1574
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,780
Yeah.

1575
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,100
I have a final, I have a final.

1576
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,940
John Roderick.

1577
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,780
In the long winter season.

1578
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,140
He says he don't get to the park

1579
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,860
until the day's to bed.

1580
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,780
Thank you, John.

1581
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,380
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

1582
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:32,980
Okay, so this one's sent in by Steven.

1583
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,900
It's, oh man, it's asked by, oh man.

1584
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,340
Who's it asked by, Griffin?

1585
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,380
Bee Yatch Chick.

1586
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,220
Oh boy.

1587
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:47,220
Guys, Yahoo will tell you how old the answers are

1588
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,260
or how old the question is, right?

1589
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,620
Griffin, is it possible that it's Bee Yatch Chick,

1590
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,820
like a yacht?

1591
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,900
That's probably it.

1592
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,900
Okay.

1593
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,940
This one is from, and it says this, one decade ago.

1594
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,780
Whoa.

1595
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,180
Isn't that wild that they would say that

1596
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,980
and not 10 years ago?

1597
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,500
If this website stays up for 100 years,

1598
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,060
will this say one century ago?

1599
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,780
Yeah.

1600
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,900
This question from millennia's past.

1601
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,660
From the Mesozoic era.

1602
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,540
This one comes and it says,

1603
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:26,380
what are some exercises that don't give you yucky musculars?

1604
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,460
Oh, what was that, Smacker Roy?

1605
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,620
I just, I just.

1606
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,460
I just.

1607
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,300
I just.

1608
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,140
I just.

1609
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,980
I just.

1610
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,820
I just.

1611
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,660
I just.

1612
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,500
I just.

1613
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,340
I just.

1614
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,180
I just.

1615
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,020
I just.

1616
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,860
I just.

1617
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,700
I just.

1618
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,140
I'm Travis.

1619
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,660
I'm Griffin Macka-Roy.

1620
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,700
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

1621
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,020
May Kiss Your Dad.

1622
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,940
Square on the Lips.

1623
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,880
ь

1624
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,080
Make the girls do you want to,

1625
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,080
just say that I wanna.

1626
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,580
Artist-owned.

1627
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,700
Audience-supported.

1628
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:18,700
Do you like mysteries? Are you a fan of teenagers? Do you enjoy the struggles of lonely, middle-aged men?

1629
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,700
If so, may we recommend a TV show for you?

1630
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,700
Dicktown. The show is called Dicktown.

1631
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,700
And I'm John Hodgman.

1632
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,700
And I'm David Ries of Dicktown.

1633
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,700
Our show, called Dicktown, is available now on Hulu.

1634
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:38,700
John plays John Hunchman, a former prodigy child detective who used to solve mysteries for his classmates in North Carolina.

1635
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:45,700
Now he's all grown up, living on a shabby houseboat, and still solving mysteries for teenagers on Dicktown.

1636
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:52,700
And David plays David Purfoy, my former bully and nemesis, and now my driver, muscle, and only friend.

1637
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,700
There are mysteries popping off all over the place. The mystery of the controversial cosplay.

1638
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:03,700
The mystery of the maybe-boyfriend. The mystery of the mumbling rapper.

1639
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,700
And there are celebrity guest stars popping off all over the place.

1640
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:13,700
Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Schaal, Paul F. Tompkins, Anna Akana, H. John Benjamin. So many stars.

1641
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:22,700
So please, go to bit.ly slash dicktown. That's B-I-T dot L-Y slash D-I-C-K-T-O-W-M.

1642
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,700
That'll take you right to Hulu, where you can watch all ten episodes right now.

1643
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:32,700
John Hodgman is in full Wikipedia mode right now. Just go to the link and watch Dicktown and thank us later.

1644
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Yeah, we made a TV show and called it Dicktown.

1645
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,700
It's the only good thing that happened this year.
