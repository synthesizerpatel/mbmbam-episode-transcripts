1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Hey everybody, welcome to Columbo Bim Bam. My name is Justin McElroy.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
My name's Kid Vid, which is, which, my Christian name is Griffin McElroy, the baby's brother.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
And Kid Vid is like his, his like vacation, uh, nom de poux.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,560
Yeah, you know how everybody has a vacation name when they're out on vacation?

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,120
For this one, I'm Kid Vid, because I'm glued to the screens.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
Hey, it's Kid Vid, and this one, welcome to Columbo Bim Bam.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
This is our summer series, where it's just like the Bim Bam you've come to know and love,

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
I hope, and, but it's kind of a major vibe.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,440
And, you know, like we took the summer off, and we're spending our summer working at like,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
you know, like a resort, and maybe like Justin's teaching volleyball,

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,680
and like Griffin's teaching, uh, beach video games, apparently, and I'm like maybe doing surfing.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,120
And maybe like one of us has a crush on Stacey Kurose, and, you know, like we're all just hanging

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,960
out, and you used to our antics at Bayside, but now we're Oceanside.

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
Now it's different.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,160
Do you remember when they made summer Coke, and they just put mangoes or whatever the fuck in

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,640
there, and the flavor was so bad that you were legally allowed to go into a convenience store

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
and kick over the display case.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
You were legally allowed.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
And in fact, if you did that, you got a free good drink of your choice from the, from the business.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,200
They said, we're not legally allowed to do that, but thank you for freeing us from this prison.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
They said, we hate, we hate summer Coke, is what they said.

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
But you're not gonna hate summer, uh, My Brother, My Brother, Me,

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,880
because I'm out on a beach, and I'm doing a video game seminar about Fester's Quest.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Where did he hide all the light bulbs?

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,320
Where that's the kind of thing you're gonna, uh, reach out.

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
And where's the, where's the, the brick sprite in the wall that you can walk through?

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
And there's Morticia and the husband one having sex.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Having a, you know, Puggy's up to his things.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
Puggy and Wim's day.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Puggy and Wim's day.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
Puggy and Wim's day are into their tricks.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,760
Don't bring a game genie.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
And there's Cousin Whom.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't bring a game genie into the seminar.

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,400
I will skip it across the ocean's waves and it'll be lost to Neptune's bounty.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
He can break his game.

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I hate video game cheaters.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
There's almost as much as I hate summer Coke.

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,920
Oh, hey, it's, uh, new bim bam club bim bam guest star Miguel.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
He's here to talk to us about some great cocktails for the summer.

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Take it away, Miguel.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,240
Hi, Miguel.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,360
I hope you don't have a racist accent.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh boy, did you have one?

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,640
And now you're thinking of a less racist accent, Miguel?

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,880
I kind of thought Travis would be Miguel.

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,520
I was about to applaud you, Griffin, for jumping in and talking to Miguel

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,360
to excuse yourself for the sensibility of having to be Miguel.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,880
I sort of put the bunny ears up for not having to be Miguel

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,280
in this podcast scenario that you've foisted on us.

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
Hi, I'm Miguel.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,120
Hi, Miguel.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,320
Hello, I would like to tell you about beach cocktails.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah, please.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,760
What are we working with?

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Some Mai Tai, Amui Tai, something like that?

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,600
What I like to do is crack open this coconut

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,440
and then I pour it into this pineapple

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,320
and I put a shit ton of rum in there.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,040
Hell yeah.

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
Can I ask why you don't just leave the coconut in the coconut

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
while you have to put it in another vessel?

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
Well, we bought a bunch of pineapples on sale

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
and now we need to use them before the end of the summer.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Sounds like you didn't really think that one through, Miguel.

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
And now you're kind of compromising the product.

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
Well, it's the only thing keeping this island's economy afloat, Griffin.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,160
But sure, if you want the economy to go down, fuck these pineapples.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
Do you know what the sex Easter egg in Fester's Quest for the NES?

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,160
What?

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
Hold on.

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Time out.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
No one's getting a drink for 20 minutes.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,080
Show me this Easter egg.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Oh, it'll take me much longer than 20 minutes to find this sex Easter egg.

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Keeps moving around on me.

82
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
Sunsoft, you got me again, guys.

83
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
It's like Howl's Moving Castle.

84
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
Damn, Sunsoft.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Keep the porn in one place, my guys.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
Why you got to make it so hard on a preteen to find the sex Easter eggs?

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
It's so hard to find the sex Easter eggs in Fester's Quest.

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
And the game genie would make it easier.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
I wish I hadn't skipped it into the ocean.

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,080
The sad thing is there's at least one person.

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
There's one human being listed as this who currently is thinking,

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
man, I still got that tape lying around.

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,920
I got to dig back into that.

94
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,680
That sounds like my stuff.

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
Find that pixelated coitus.

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
Boy, I love the summer months.

97
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
That's the sound of it.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
How's the summer for you all?

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Wait, no, I'm curious how everybody thinks it would sound.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,040
Gumbaz Morticia from the Annabelle head sex in an NES game.

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
Travis, let me get this ear ears one more time.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,480
Meep meep meep meep meep meep.

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,680
Okay, mine, I think, is more like pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow.

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,080
Mine would be like spoken through like one of those 8-bit voice modulators

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
that they could only get, I think, on like Sega Genesis games.

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,520
That's where they first came up with.

107
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
They're like, oh, yeah.

108
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
And it's like, what was that?

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,480
Oh, yeah, all right, sex.

110
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,520
Hey, Steven, can I talk to you about Fester's Quest real quick?

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
We're about to release it.

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
How did you go so far over budget?

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,600
The game, it's not that big a game, and I can't see where all the money went.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,360
Well, there's a sound blaster chip embedded in each cartridge,

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,760
and we got that in there to really get the sex noises.

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
You know, you've heard of the mode 7 chip?

117
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
This is the mode 6 chip.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,160
This is mode 16, mode 69.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Wait, there's sex in this game?

120
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
I don't know if we can put this game out.

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
Not for everybody.

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, just for those diligent children.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,080
What's great is you find the Fester's Quest sex Easter egg,

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,400
and then Fester actually walks towards the camera until he gets very, very close,

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,640
and then he provides like a sound blaster voice chip sex lesson.

126
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
While we're saying as completely natural.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Yeah, okay, approved.

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,600
Thumbs up.

129
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,960
Release away.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,280
Sounds great.

131
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,840
Yeah, green light.

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
We've gone gold, folks.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
And that's how Miguel lost his job in the video game industry

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
and ended up slinging drinks at Club NB&B AM.

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
He was just so gratified that somebody had found it.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,080
How much budget did you spend on diagrams?

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
Because there's a lot of pretty blocky pixels in there.

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,000
If they have to render anything with any accuracy, I feel like it'd be a little tricky.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,760
This does explain why Fester's Quest was just like you walked through one door

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,280
and it was the kill screen.

141
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
Because apparently they put the rest of the game behind a pixelated wall.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
All the spooky energy could be found just on that first little map.

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
Little did you know the real spooky energy was hiding behind that secret sprite.

144
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Secret sprite was my second least favorite modified beverage

145
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
that they released for the summer.

146
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
Can we do some advice?

147
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
I can never find it.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
We just spent seven minutes talking about fucking Fester's Quest,

149
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,640
the NES game made by Sunsoft, full of sex.

150
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,680
I think it was full of Sunsoft.

151
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
I've said it so many times now that it must be true.

152
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,360
I just want to address something really quick.

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,640
What kind of fucking misguided logic was going on for the Sunsoft corporate family

154
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,280
where they thought, you know what kids are like into right now?

155
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
The fucking Addams Family.

156
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,920
Not only that, what member of the Addams Family has the most heat right now?

157
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,640
Well, yeah, which one is like really?

158
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,680
Because here's the thing.

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
The Addams Family movie didn't come out until two years after Fester's Quest.

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,520
Why?

161
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
So this is trying to cap-

162
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
Yes, Travis.

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
What I'm telling you is this is trying to capitalize on the heat

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,000
from the series that ran from 1964 to 1966.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
And this game came out in 89, right?

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,080
So it's like, but what are they trying to trade on?

167
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
It was the brother game to its sister game,

168
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
which is a game based on the one normal human from the Munsters.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
But it was just like a Willy Beamish scenario

170
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
where she just like walked around town

171
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
and made friends with people and ate a sandwich.

172
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't even get me started about Pugsley's scavenger hunt.

173
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
Like why would you think we want to spend a lot of time with Pugsley?

174
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
And why would you think we'd want to spend that time

175
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,840
looking for hidden items in the Addams house?

176
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,680
Anyway, can we please not talk about Sunsoft games anymore?

177
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Yeah, I just want to real quick say air the acrobat.

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,440
Moving on, just before we get in,

179
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
we wanted to tell everybody, we got special guests this week,

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
Jake and Amir from If I Were You, their podcast,

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
and of course, all their YouTube videos and TV show and everything.

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
They're on our podcast to give some advice to you,

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
the people, just like they do on their podcast.

184
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,400
And Travis-

185
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
So they're bringing it straight to you.

186
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
On their episode that goes live today also, Travis is on their podcast.

187
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
We did a little crossover because their thing is also an advice podcast

188
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
and the beef has been like so real lately.

189
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
And the, let's call it what it is,

190
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,080
which is a full blown social media battlefield.

191
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
We needed to disarm each other.

192
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
And so we've done this with this joint operation.

193
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Yeah, so everything's cool for now.

194
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
Now, I really want to stress that for now.

195
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,560
We'll see.

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,760
We'll see.

197
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,480
We'll see how it go.

198
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,320
So here's a question.

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,760
My roommate moved out four months ago.

200
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
He continued to pay his half of the rent while I lived alone

201
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,960
until the end of our lease.

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
Considering that I've done all the cleaning,

203
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,600
how do I split up the deposit we get back?

204
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,440
Does he still deserve half since he paid rent all this time?

205
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
Or do I get a larger chunk since I was integral

206
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
in getting the deposit back?

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
That's from Courteous Cleaner in Kansas.

208
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
You know, it's a funny thing about a security deposit,

209
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
especially when you're younger,

210
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
because I think you do give,

211
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
like they're treating this in this question.

212
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,080
I was about to take unbridged with the fact

213
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,680
that they're treating it like a bonus

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,240
and not like money that they're getting back

215
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
that they paid together.

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,040
But like the truth of the matter is when you're that age,

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,560
it might as well be like, well, never seen that money again.

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,520
Yeah, that's true.

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,320
Yeah, but the thing is, you're right though.

220
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
It's not, your deposit isn't a reward

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
for cleaning your apartment.

222
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,280
It's the money that you needed for them

223
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
to give you the apartment in the first place.

224
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
And like if he paid half of it,

225
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
it's like they just held on to your like $500

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,240
and then hand it back to you at the end of the year.

227
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
Can I tell the sorrowful tale of,

228
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
we're gathering on the fucking midnight society fire.

229
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
This is part of my bim bam club.

230
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
It's nighttime on the beach.

231
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm about to throw that coffee creamer into the fire,

232
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
make it spark up.

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,280
And the words of the tale of the Batavia, Ohio apartment

234
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,640
lost damage deposit because Travis is a goombus

235
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
appears on the screen.

236
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
And then I tell the story of we had a hookah we used once

237
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
and it was a fateful time because it fell over

238
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,600
and we didn't realize the coal had rolled under the coffee table.

239
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,320
And when we found it,

240
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
luckily it hadn't burned our house down with us inside of it,

241
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
but it did burn a perfect circle into the carpet.

242
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,400
And Travis, his fucking tinker Taylor mind ticking away,

243
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,040
tick, tick, tick.

244
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
He said, how can I solve this problem?

245
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,800
He went into a closet and cut some of the carpet out of that closet

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,160
and then glued it into the circle that was missing.

247
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,280
And the landlord caught both things.

248
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,600
They said you fucked up two parts of the carpet.

249
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,280
Now you are missing a key to this story, Griffin.

250
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,880
There's a very big element.

251
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,440
Oh yes.

252
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, you're right.

253
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
I burned my foot very badly on the coal.

254
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Well, that too.

255
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,440
But when we moved in,

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
they were offering a special in which the deposit was only $100.

257
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
So after we moved out and they tried to get money from me,

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
my justification was,

259
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
I guess you should have charged more money for the deposit.

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,320
You should have charged,

261
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,960
you should have trusted us less.

262
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,360
Yep.

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,720
And they never got that money.

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,020
Good.

265
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,960
I had a friend in college who he had ridden his apartment hard,

266
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,640
I would say, and put it down wet.

267
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,640
He put it down wet and he ran it hard and he's a dear friend.

268
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,400
We spent basically all our college time there.

269
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
And then when time came to move out,

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,520
we all really hated his landlord

271
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,000
and that sort of adversarial relationship

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,520
that college renters can only have with their landlord.

273
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,720
And since he knew he wasn't gonna get his damage deposit back,

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
the day he moved all his stuff out,

275
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
he burned his initials into the carpet with lighter fluid.

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
Now I know what you're thinking.

277
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
That's not how that works.

278
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
That's still a crime.

279
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
And the answer is yes, you're correct.

280
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
But nothing bad came of it.

281
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
My friend Justin was living in his apartment

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
and the landlords informed him that he needed to get the fuck out

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,520
because they were going to demolish the building

284
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,560
halfway through his lease to turn it into a parking lot

285
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,440
for the Marshall University Stadium

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,960
and that they were not going to refund him any money

287
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
or anything like that.

288
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,720
So we had a party and destroyed his apartment.

289
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,280
Our justification was they were going to demolish the building anyway.

290
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,520
Yeah, so we like knocked doors out of the frame

291
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,960
and kicked holes through walls.

292
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,840
Man, we're a bunch of rowdy rebel boys, aren't we?

293
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah, for sure, used to be.

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,520
Here's the answer to this.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,640
First of all, I mean, I'm leaning towards

296
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
you gotta just give them their part of the deposit back

297
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,360
because they paid that money probably without agreeing

298
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,840
to not get it back if you clean up the house.

299
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,480
Also, I'm assuming they cleaned up their self mess

300
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
when they moved out four months ago

301
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,760
and the fact that they kept paying the rent,

302
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
like yeah, I think they get the money back on this one.

303
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
That's true. You got a whole apartment to yourself

304
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
for like four months.

305
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,040
And they paid the rent for it.

306
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,560
Like that's, yeah, you gotta give them their money back.

307
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, sorry.

308
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,440
Do you want a Yahoo?

309
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
Absolutely.

310
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
This one was sent in by,

311
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
this one was sent in by level 9000,

312
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
Yajur, Drew, Drew, Davenport.

313
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,120
Thank you, Drew.

314
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
It's by Yajur Answers user.

315
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Ya dash who?

316
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
By the way, still waiting for that other shoe to drop.

317
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah, still waiting for Uncle Verizon to be like,

318
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,720
should we call it Verizon Answers?

319
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,760
No, let's just delete this incredibly valuable resource.

320
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,400
If anybody, like kidding aside,

321
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,280
if anybody has a contact over at Verizon

322
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,400
like that would know,

323
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
the answer is probably nobody right now

324
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,920
because who gives a shit,

325
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
but like if anybody could reach out

326
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,280
and just put us in contact with them

327
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,360
or we would really appreciate it.

328
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,280
Also, if they're looking to rebrand,

329
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,240
we'll do some synergy

330
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,880
and they can call it McElroy Answers or something like that.

331
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
If not, we'll have to do some social media campaigning

332
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,880
and I don't want it to come to that

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
because that can be exhausting.

334
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,200
I tried yelling at the young woman

335
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
from the Verizon commercials

336
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
where she was like in the store

337
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
and I just yelled last time

338
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,560
that I saw on those commercials on my TV,

339
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
like please don't take this from me,

340
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
like over and over and over again.

341
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
And in fact, I've done it every time

342
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,360
that commercials come on

343
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,240
and that's because that's the secret.

344
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
You gotta visualize the energy and put it out there.

345
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm pretty good friends with, can you hear me now?

346
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
But he moved, he's at Sprint now,

347
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
so that's no good either.

348
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,760
I bet we could-

349
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,840
I can go down to the kiosk at the mall

350
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
and just see what that kid knows.

351
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,760
Which store does the woman from the commercial work at?

352
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Because I think she's the-

353
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,200
That's AT&T.

354
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
You're talking about my friend, Milana.

355
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
I think she's the president of,

356
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
oh, you're right.

357
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,520
Ah, beans, she probably wouldn't be able

358
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,960
to help us out with the Verizon thing

359
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,920
unless she knows some sort of government backdoor

360
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,200
into Verizon servers.

361
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,840
No, it's just her and Flo

362
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
and can you hear me now

363
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
and all the other human spokespeople hanging out.

364
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,200
Where's the beef?

365
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,840
And where's the beef?

366
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,400
She's there.

367
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
Where's the beef?

368
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,800
It's there.

369
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,400
They're all there.

370
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Time to make the, time to make the bone nuts.

371
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
John Machida, they're all there.

372
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,800
Dude, you're getting the Dell got invited in

373
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,720
after Jared left, was kicked out.

374
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,400
He was dishonorably discharged.

375
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Anyway, yahoo.

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
They're just all sitting around a kitchen table

377
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,120
eating garmin bozza,

378
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,080
just like being terrified like that one

379
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,040
seen from Firewalk with me.

380
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,280
Anyway, here we go.

381
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,400
Yahoo asks, that's the user's name.

382
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,760
Is there anything you can do to mute the sounds

383
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
coming from the bathroom

384
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,040
if it's about 10 feet from the living room?

385
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
I don't even understand why I have to ask this.

386
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,120
Same, bro.

387
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,920
How is there not a product on every shelf

388
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,040
in every convenience store

389
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,280
to do something about muting bathroom noise

390
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
from urination to defecation?

391
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,400
Thank you, doctor.

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
Should I just put a button with a music player nearby

393
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,960
or automatically have loud music play

394
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,280
when a sensor detects the door closed?

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
That ain't mute.

396
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,560
You're talking, okay.

397
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,320
No, we're talking about is drowning out.

398
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
That's boring.

399
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
Yeah, if it baffling,

400
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
the loud music is a non-starter

401
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
because if I have friends over

402
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
and I've made them a big meal

403
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,840
and we're watching, you know, Bachelorette

404
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
and then I leave the room

405
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
and then from down the hallway,

406
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,520
they just hear,

407
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
here's my cherry pie.

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Like they're gonna know

409
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,680
what's happening down that hallway.

410
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,200
What you need is,

411
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,240
you need some sort of like airlock scenario

412
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
and like baffling

413
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
and maybe some like caulking around,

414
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
like maybe some like a foam

415
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,560
that fills up a doorway.

416
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
Do you think if old timey people

417
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
who use outhouses,

418
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
like we think of them as so backwards,

419
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
but if you think if they came into our world

420
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
and the modern world

421
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,760
and saw what we did,

422
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,640
they'd be like,

423
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
oh my God, you do it in the house?

424
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,920
You just shit in the house?

425
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
You just shit in your house?

426
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,080
That's buff wild.

427
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
That's profane.

428
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,080
Wow.

429
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
You just like basically go in a closet

430
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
and shit in a hole?

431
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,640
What's the matter with you?

432
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
Let me get this straight.

433
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,800
The same place where you nurse your infant baby

434
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,080
and lay your head down to sleep

435
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,200
on pillows of down

436
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,520
is also where you decide to shit?

437
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
That doesn't make sense.

438
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
That's all the same air.

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,040
You understand that, right?

440
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Like we live in the 1700s,

441
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,680
but even we get that's the same air, dog.

442
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Next you'll be telling me

443
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
you let your women vote.

444
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Well, we got to think about,

445
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,440
I mean, first of all,

446
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,680
there is a wonderful place on earth

447
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
that has figured this out.

448
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,800
And if we did this in the Japanese style,

449
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,480
we would have a button on the toilet

450
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
and this really only covers two onesies

451
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,560
because they have a button

452
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,600
on most of their toilets

453
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,040
that they have the bidet function

454
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,160
and then pressure temperature.

455
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,960
Sweet scent is one of the buttons.

456
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
But then there's a button

457
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
that just makes water noises happen.

458
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,280
So nobody can tell what is pee

459
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
and what is the brook.

460
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,680
Griffin, you got to take that a step further.

461
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Just splashing splashers.

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,280
Just have it randomly trigger

463
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
when no one's in the room

464
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,760
all the time at random.

465
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
Oh, I see.

466
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,880
So I have friends over.

467
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,080
We're all sitting at the dinner table.

468
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,800
Like everybody knows

469
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,680
we're all at the dinner table

470
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
and from down the hallway,

471
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
it's just, she's not terrible.

472
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
What if it just made the noise

473
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,520
of a human defecating console?

474
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
That's what I'm saying.

475
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Yeah, like camouflage, right?

476
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,640
Right.

477
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
You can't hide it.

478
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,840
So instead you got to hide in plain sight.

479
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Damn, Mike, where did you get that new car?

480
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
That's fucking awesome.

481
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,160
I came into some money.

482
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
I did some, let's just say,

483
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
widely distributed voiceover work.

484
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh my God.

485
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,120
It's like the hunt for Siri.

486
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,040
It's like the hunt for Toilet Man.

487
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,160
Because when you press the toilet,

488
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,240
it's just one guy just going like,

489
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,040
oh, come on.

490
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,360
And it's like, oh, you're a little bit extra,

491
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
but you can get expansion packs

492
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
that include Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal.

493
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah, but the base pack is just a guy like,

494
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,200
please.

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
And then like that guy goes to Quiznos

496
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
or something like that is like,

497
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
let me get the deli scramble.

498
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
And they're like, holy shit.

499
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,520
Can you say that again?

500
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,240
Because I think it's him.

501
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
We found him, Toilet Man.

502
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,560
Could you say not like this over and over again?

503
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,440
Can you say not like this,

504
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
like in the Matrix movies?

505
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,040
By the way, why did you quote the Matrix movies

506
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,560
while you were recording this?

507
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
And why did you only record like five sounds?

508
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,080
And why did you record no sounds

509
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
of the stool being like deposited?

510
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
It's just human man speaking.

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
And waiting for the women to create-

512
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,640
There is no spoon.

513
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,600
What was that meant to symbolize?

514
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,240
What was that all about?

515
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
And even in the women's restrooms,

516
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
they use the same voice box,

517
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,160
which is weird, you would think.

518
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,840
Would you want somebody who's like,

519
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
obviously Rocky style scraping for every inch,

520
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
like fighting tooth and nail?

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
Or would you want somebody who just like

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
is a stone killer and goes in and no scopes,

523
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,320
like just blast it or clean out?

524
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,040
Like no problem.

525
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,120
I would actually want it to be a variable, Justin.

526
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
So that some days I could really pull for him.

527
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,920
Oh, there's a dial.

528
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,360
I could be really proud of him.

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
There's a dial that on the toilet

530
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
before you punch the button.

531
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
That's like how Buckwild's about to get in here.

532
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
And it's represented by the hospital pain scale.

533
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
What would be fucking great is if

534
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,560
they could work a little bit of narrative in there.

535
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,880
You know, like if I'm gonna have to listen to this guy

536
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
crowing about his toos all the time,

537
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
he could at least work it like he's maybe the spy.

538
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,800
That would be good.

539
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,040
Or just one time mix in some muttering

540
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,720
about his asshole boss.

541
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
Or maybe like just a little crying.

542
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
Yeah, he's like reading his secret government files

543
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,200
while he's doing it.

544
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
So you're like piecing together-

545
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
I have to pass this data chip I swallowed in Moscow.

546
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,560
Or maybe you can make it like a romantic storyline

547
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,000
where you can hear him like intermittently

548
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
practicing his vows, right?

549
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
Oh, I love that.

550
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,800
Oh, he's got a nervous tummy.

551
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,920
It's a big day for him.

552
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,440
The third option is, of course, anti-sound.

553
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
And you may be wondering, Griffin, what is that?

554
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,680
Well, every sound has an anti-sound that cancels it out.

555
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,720
So if you play both at once, it's just silence.

556
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,320
So there has to be some sort of way

557
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
to put a mic in the turlet,

558
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,800
and then it generates procedurally anti-sound

559
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,040
for your humiliating splashes.

560
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,440
I love that, Griffin.

561
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
That's a great idea, actually.

562
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
That tech exists.

563
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,400
It's gotta be like,

564
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,400
you know what I mean?

565
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
Like that's the op-

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
Like, is the opposite of what a toilet sound would be.

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,840
The sound from Pepsi, ma'am?

568
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes, that's a good ass reference, Travis.

569
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
You just somehow went deeper than Fester's Quest.

570
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,200
Thank you.

571
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,560
Something everyone can enjoy.

572
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
Dear Brothers 3, I work as a print production manager

573
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,160
for a small athletic apparel company.

574
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
There are only five employees.

575
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
My boss is very annoying slash childish.

576
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,880
An unspoken part of my job is to be her friend.

577
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,440
She complains when we don't like her personal posts on FB.

578
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
That's Facebook.

579
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
They don't say that, I was clarifying.

580
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
If I come to work and treat her like my boss

581
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,280
and not my BFF, she retaliates.

582
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,560
And the office dynamic turns into a weird mean girl spinoff.

583
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,080
In response, I have started to hate bake every Monday.

584
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
I bring in some homemade baked goods to work.

585
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
I find the recipe with the most butter

586
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,560
and watch as my coworkers who are on perpetual diets

587
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
gorge themselves.

588
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Am I good?

589
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,600
And that's from counting your calories in Cali.

590
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,120
And they say at the end, as if to cut her off here,

591
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
uh, cut us off here, uh, I am looking for a new job.

592
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,340
Okay.

593
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,660
Cause that was the obvious.

594
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,980
Hey dog, you're like the Count of Monte Cristo

595
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,260
if he was bad and actually made dope ass

596
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,780
Monte Cristo sandwiches for his, his, his worst enemies

597
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,740
and then had them eat it.

598
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,340
And they said, hmm, great sandwich.

599
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,020
Well, back to being evil.

600
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,060
You did not-

601
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,100
The revenge plan in the actual novel,

602
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,300
The Count of Monte Cristo is about that well thought through.

603
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,620
It's, it's a weird plan that he has in that book.

604
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,580
And it was about this, uh, effective.

605
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,740
But it's like, no, it's not this effective

606
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,700
cause this effective is here's some cupcakes.

607
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,260
Ah, fuck.

608
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,620
Ah, fuck.

609
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,900
I just thought about it.

610
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,260
And I just gave you cupcakes.

611
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,900
That was bad.

612
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,180
That was a reward.

613
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,980
Oops.

614
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,140
I want to be there when this person,

615
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
when question asked, like tells a friend,

616
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,820
like their devious plan, like,

617
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,340
so I made them get this brownies.

618
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,340
And they're like, oh, what'd you put in the brownies?

619
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,460
And they're like butter.

620
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,980
There's a sentence in here I want to translate.

621
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
In response, I've started to hate bake.

622
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,660
You just mean bake because baking is love, right?

623
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,900
Like you can't, you can't as try as hard as you will.

624
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,300
You can't put hate into a thing that you bake, right?

625
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,540
Every Monday I bring homemade baked goods to work.

626
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,020
That's dope.

627
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,620
I find the recipe with the most butter.

628
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,420
You mean the best recipe that there is?

629
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,300
You can actually, you can only put hate into no bake

630
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,980
because you apply a little bit of heat

631
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,020
and it bakes right off.

632
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,540
So you need to do like a cheesecake

633
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,220
or maybe like one of those peanut butter cookies

634
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
that you don't actually have to bake.

635
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,100
You can put some hate in those.

636
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,340
That would be an amazing subplot on Great British Bake Off.

637
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,020
If one of the contestants are just like,

638
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm here because Mary Berry killed my nephew

639
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,820
in a hit and run and covered it up.

640
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,660
And I'm getting back at her the only way I know how.

641
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,660
Baking for her.

642
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,580
The scone was very buttery, dear.

643
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,540
Yeah, it was.

644
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,860
Yeah.

645
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,740
Hell yeah, it was.

646
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:45,860
Don't eat that Mary Berry or it's a bad break.

647
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,820
Fucking Paul Hollywood, like flying through the air.

648
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,900
That's actually how Paul Hollywood always sounds.

649
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
That was just our regular Paul Hollywood impression.

650
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,540
Can we ever, have we ever had a discussion

651
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,220
about Paul Hollywood's name?

652
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,700
The most British, the very, very British baking man,

653
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,660
Paul Hollywood.

654
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,900
It's his real ass, that's his family name.

655
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,300
I thought people were fucking with him

656
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,020
until literally like two seasons in.

657
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,380
I thought that Paul Hollywood,

658
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,060
like maybe he'd had like a career for a bit

659
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,420
trying to make it as an actor or something

660
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,620
and people were just trolling him.

661
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,020
No, his name's Paul Hollywood.

662
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,460
That would be like, if like Sylvester Stallone, right?

663
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,260
That's an action movie star, Hollywood movie star name.

664
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,220
It'd be like if his name was like Nigel Sconceworth.

665
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,980
Like what?

666
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,460
No, wait, but the pushback I would say

667
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,740
is that Paul Hollywood would be an insane name

668
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,420
for any living human.

669
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,940
It would be like if your name was Doug Box Office.

670
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,460
It sounds like the name you would make up

671
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,100
for an action movie star in a fake movie

672
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,780
in the movie you were making.

673
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,260
Yeah, a bad movie within a movie within a movie.

674
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,140
It would be like if there was a man named Paul Hollywood

675
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,380
who was an action movie star

676
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
and then he traded,

677
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,700
somehow his name one day just became Nigel Bredman

678
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,660
and then like Nigel Bredman received the title Paul Hollywood.

679
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,180
It's like a reverse quickening.

680
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,540
If your name was Paul Hollywood

681
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,900
and you wanted to go into acting,

682
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,180
you would legally change your name to something else

683
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,460
because no one would believe

684
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,540
that your legal name was Paul Hollywood

685
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,060
when you auditioned for anything.

686
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,860
And hey, everybody, don't tell me,

687
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,380
don't please, please don't tweet or email the show.

688
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,060
It's like, actually Hollywood is this building in the UK

689
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,380
is the Queen's middle name or something.

690
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,660
I don't wanna know, okay?

691
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,580
We ruined Hollywood, okay?

692
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,740
We took that one and we ruined it.

693
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,580
Whatever it was over in your land,

694
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm sorry, it's not that anymore.

695
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,860
We ruined it, it's ours.

696
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,020
It's ours, we ruined it.

697
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,700
If his name was Paul New York,

698
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,540
it would be just as fucked up.

699
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,260
Yeah, not good.

700
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,260
Montana is bad.

701
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,540
I'm trying to think of one American identifiable state

702
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,900
or city that it could be.

703
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,300
Paul Topeka, that's actually a pretty great name.

704
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,620
I like that.

705
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,980
Hi, I'm Paul Florida.

706
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,260
That fool follows me on Twitter.

707
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,620
I need to DM him.

708
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,260
Paul Florida?

709
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,020
Yeah, Paul Florida.

710
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,460
Yeah, you could think of it, Trav.

711
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,300
He could be the first person to ever ask him

712
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,340
about his crazy name.

713
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,020
Imagine, I bet he's chomping at the bit to unpack that.

714
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,060
Let's do one more Yahoo.

715
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,780
This one sent in by level 9000 YajurJude again.

716
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,260
Thank you, Drew.

717
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,380
It's by, I didn't say his name, Drew Davenport.

718
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,900
There, write it in the fucking stars.

719
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Elizabeth Smith who asks,

720
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,180
and really think about this

721
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,140
because you're gonna hear it and you'll be like,

722
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,820
this is a dumb question, let's move on.

723
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,660
But I really need you to really ponder it.

724
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,500
When do waiters eat?

725
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,620
If a waiter works from eight to four,

726
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,700
when does he or she eat lunch?

727
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,460
How do waiters eat?

728
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,220
Griffin, this is such a dumb question

729
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,740
because the answer's so obvious.

730
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,660
They eat whatever's left over on your plate

731
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,180
when you pay out and leave.

732
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,660
No, because they're waiting, Travis, during that time.

733
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,620
If they're, I don't want them to-

734
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,580
But that's what they're waiting for.

735
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,620
They're waiting for you to leave

736
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,980
so they can eat what's on your plate.

737
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,500
That's why they call them waiters?

738
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,940
Yeah. It's interesting.

739
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,620
Because they're waiting to see what you leave

740
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,740
and they're like, oh, mashed potatoes.

741
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,180
At nice places, they don't even wait till you leave.

742
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,900
They wait till your view is averted

743
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
and they'll just snatch one of the chicken tenders

744
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
off your plate.

745
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,420
Those nice fancy chicken tender places.

746
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,140
Some restaurants even have extra chairs at each table

747
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,620
and you're supposed to order something for the waiter

748
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,820
and then they bring the food to you

749
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,140
and then they just sit down and have a gab.

750
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,300
But the trick is you can never actually see them

751
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,980
put food in their mouths.

752
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,540
So you look to your left to see where the bathroom is

753
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,900
and you look back and their steak's gone.

754
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,220
They're just dabbing the corners of their mouth

755
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,100
and you're like, damn.

756
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,140
And they're just dabbing.

757
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,020
They're doing the dance.

758
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,900
They're just dabbing.

759
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,020
When do they eat though?

760
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,780
Because that was a funny joke, but seriously,

761
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
I'm looking at these folks and I'm saying,

762
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,780
how do you do it?

763
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,340
Because I see a doctor or a dentist,

764
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,540
getting your teeth done isn't a biological,

765
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,380
daily like several times a day biological imperative.

766
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,860
You can like go and you're off office hours and go.

767
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,420
You gots to eat between eight and four.

768
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,020
You'll die otherwise.

769
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
How do the waiters eat and when do they do it?

770
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,780
I like to think that there's other waiters

771
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,420
who are waiting on the waiters to get what they want

772
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,540
when they're back in the back.

773
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,740
They're just following them around the restaurant.

774
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,180
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir.

775
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,340
I actually work at the restaurant across the street.

776
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,460
I really need to get back.

777
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,740
Like if you could, sir.

778
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,140
How do they eat though?

779
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
I mean, we're talking about a little old lady at this point.

780
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,740
It's waiters all the way down, Griffin.

781
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,940
Yeah, you think there's fewer waiters

782
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,740
the further you go, right?

783
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,100
So a restaurant with 16 waiters,

784
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,580
maybe they have eight waiter waiters that helps them out

785
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,020
and then just diminishing returns.

786
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,300
There's four waiter, waiter, waiters

787
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,620
and it keeps going down to just one waiter, waiter, waiter,

788
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,380
waiter, waiter and they'll die.

789
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,820
Oh yeah, but that's nature.

790
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,180
Griffin, sometimes one has to die so that many may live.

791
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,780
Yeah.

792
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,420
Do you think anybody, like what would happen

793
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,740
if you ordered, like you're there with you

794
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,060
and your spouse or significant other?

795
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,540
Because only married people are allowed to go to restaurants.

796
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,980
No, I just needed a number, okay?

797
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,140
So you're there with your spouse or significant other

798
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,980
or just a friend maybe or whatever.

799
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,580
Or your insignificant other.

800
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,340
Or somebody, a stranger, an escort, I don't care.

801
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,540
You're there with one other person

802
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,300
and you order three entrees

803
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,980
and when the waiter brings them,

804
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,740
you say the third one is for you.

805
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,340
Please take a seat.

806
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,580
Take, rest those puppies.

807
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,020
That's what they're, did you know all waiters

808
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,620
are secretly hoping that you'll do that?

809
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,220
Oh, like genies.

810
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,620
They're waiting to be freed from their prison.

811
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
You know, did you know it's like Dobby?

812
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,860
If you give a waiter a dinner,

813
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,100
they're free and they'll have to be waiters anymore.

814
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,300
And then they're out of a job.

815
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,820
So like, oh, they hate it.

816
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,900
They finish the chicken tenders

817
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,460
and then you say, there will be no tip.

818
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,740
And then they turn into smoke

819
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,100
and fly into the salt shaker.

820
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,820
You've trapped them.

821
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,700
I'll wait on you now.

822
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:08,660
Now I'm the waiter.

823
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,940
You waited long enough.

824
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,700
Allow me.

825
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,380
If you went to a restaurant, okay, listen.

826
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,700
Okay.

827
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,900
If you went to a restaurant

828
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,420
that offered you the option

829
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,820
to take your own plates

830
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,540
into a window at the kitchen when you were done,

831
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,340
would you, but they made it perfectly clear

832
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,940
that it's fine if you leave them.

833
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,980
Would you do it?

834
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,340
Is there any bet?

835
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,100
Do I save money if I do it myself?

836
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,660
There's nothing.

837
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,300
There's nothing.

838
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,580
Then no.

839
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,020
No.

840
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,140
Okay, Travis says no.

841
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,420
Griffin, what do you say?

842
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,300
Yeah, I'd do it.

843
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,980
Yeah, I would have no choice.

844
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,540
But I'm so glad they don't offer the option.

845
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,700
I would have absolutely no choice.

846
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,340
I would have to bust my own table.

847
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
I would want some sort of candy

848
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,780
from the transaction though.

849
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,260
Oh, what a good boy.

850
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,420
I open up, here comes the peppermint.

851
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,540
Peppermint.

852
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,260
I would call this restaurant Dick's First Resort,

853
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,580
where it's all about how nice everyone can be all the time.

854
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:02,980
Yeah.

855
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,500
Okay, now I'm ready to go to the money man.

856
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,460
First up, I want to tell everybody

857
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,740
about Bowling Branch.

858
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,460
Okay.

859
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,060
Bowling, if you're sleeping,

860
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,020
and you should be.

861
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,860
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

862
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,500
Yeah, I know.

863
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,660
If you're sleeping, it's essential.

864
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,780
Then you should be sleeping on the finest sheets available.

865
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,820
And for my money, that's BowlingBranch.com.

866
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,300
B-O-L-L-N Branch.

867
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,460
They release the luxury linens.

868
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,260
That's what they sell.

869
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,300
Luxury linens.

870
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,660
But you're not paying the crazy markups

871
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,180
you pay at a department store.

872
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,700
You get all the comfort of luxury sheets

873
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,380
without paying luxury prices.

874
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,420
Now, I know what you're thinking.

875
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,940
I want to try these for myself,

876
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,300
but I'm worried about the risk.

877
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,020
Well, don't.

878
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,940
Just go to BowlingBranch.com.

879
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,260
B-O-L-L-N Branch.com.

880
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,820
And they'll let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

881
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,900
If you don't love them, you can send them back.

882
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,420
You have nothing to lose.

883
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,220
Better than that.

884
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,380
If you turn them into ghost costumes,

885
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,540
you will not, that doesn't, no.

886
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,580
That ain't gonna fly.

887
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,500
It will strengthen up between you

888
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,540
and your sibling's bed

889
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
because you share a room in a 90s sitcom

890
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,140
and you guys are having a tiff.

891
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,900
As long as you don't puncture them in any way,

892
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,340
you can probably still return them.

893
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,540
Probably still be okay.

No.

906
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,020
Okay.

907
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,740
Ask Justin.

908
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm not in the mood right now.

909
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,300
Okay, Justin, I'm gonna ask you.

910
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,340
Yeah.

911
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,860
Do you know wine?

912
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,980
No.

913
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,300
I don't know anything about wine.

914
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,700
What if you had a friend that-

915
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,180
No, really.

916
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,300
No, listen.

917
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,420
No, listen to what I'm doing.

918
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,660
Oh, I don't know anything about wine

919
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,940
and I really hate it.

920
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,740
I wish I did.

921
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,700
Oh, are you whining?

922
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,500
Yeah.

923
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,020
So what if you had a friend who not only knew about wine-

924
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,300
Do you want some wine with that sheet?

925
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,180
Oh, God.

926
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,980
Fuck, fuck.

927
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,380
Go ahead, Trav.

928
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,740
What if you had a friend who knew about wine

929
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,260
and could get you wine

930
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,220
and all you have to do is answer a few simple questions for them?

931
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,700
I do.

932
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,500
His name's Jerry.

933
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,580
He's been hooking me up since I was 15.

934
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,300
Thanks, Jerry.

935
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,420
It's my first Jerry shout out.

936
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,660
First of many.

937
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,500
First of many.

938
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,940
Can't believe we made it 314 episodes without hitting up Jerry.

939
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,540
How have we not made some Jerry yet?

940
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Jerry.

941
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,980
If you know somebody more reliable than Jerry,

942
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,100
I'd love to hear it though.

943
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,660
I do.

944
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,940
I know a little thing called Club W.

945
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,020
Now, Club W is-

946
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,500
Okay.

947
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,020
So maybe you've done like subscription things, you know, for snacks

948
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,780
or for underpants or for stuff like that.

949
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,380
Well, this is for booze, which I always appreciate.

950
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,580
And basically what it is is you answer some questions as far as like,

951
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,740
do you like chocolate or vanilla?

952
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,580
Do you like sweet or savory?

953
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,340
Not- You don't need to know any complicated wine terminology

954
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,740
or what kind of palette or do you like chardonnay versus whatever.

955
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,060
All you need to know is like, what kind of candy you like?

956
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,780
What kind of food you like?

957
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,740
This is my brother, Travis.

958
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,420
He knows one kind of wine.

959
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,780
You don't need to know anything about wine in order to enjoy wine

960
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,620
because that's what Club W is there for.

961
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,540
You tell them the kind of stuff you like and they make suggestions for you.

962
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
And then they're going to ship it to your house.

963
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,540
And the best part is along with it comes these cards that will tell you

964
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,300
like what you should pair it with, what kind of event it's appropriate for.

965
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,980
And it's got, you know, it's usually some pretty cool labels and stuff

966
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,340
that like your friends probably have never seen in stores before.

967
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,740
And it's going to make you look like a real cool person

968
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,020
who knows their shit about wine, even though you don't.

969
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,980
Right? Right.

970
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,380
And so what you're going to do is you're going to go to clubw.com slash my brother

971
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,660
and you're going to get $20 off your first order, which is just a crazy deal.

972
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,020
And not only that, but they're going to cover,

973
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:17,060
they're going to cover shipping on that for orders of four bottles or more.

974
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,060
So you're going to get $20 off by going to clubw.com slash my brother.

975
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,940
And if you order four bottles or more, they're going to cover shipping.

976
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,620
It's a great deal. You should go check it out.

977
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,020
Hey, I've got a Jumbotron here and this one is for Stacey and it's from Tim.

978
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,860
I don't know why it sounds so accusatory.

979
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,140
Yeah, supposedly.

980
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,900
Anyway, Tim says to Stacey, Stacey, three years ago,

981
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,460
you went sugar daddy dumpster diving and found me.

982
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,140
Sugar daddy dumpster diving and found me. I hope that's an end joke.

983
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,740
I'm sure it is. Marrying you in April is, was, was the only way my life could be better.

984
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,980
You are awesome and I will always love you.

985
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,900
And now the brothers have recorded permanent proof.

986
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,180
P.S. I'm sorry I had that shirt made that said I'm with Bummy. Love, Tim.

987
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,420
Tim.

988
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,460
Tim.

989
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,100
Tim.

990
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,660
Timothy.

991
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,140
You should have done better than that, Tim.

992
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,500
Um, this sounds like a wonderful relationship.

993
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm very, very happy that you all found each other.

994
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,420
We got another Jumbotron here.

995
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,220
This message is for Shannon. It's from Jason.

996
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,180
It says, happy birthday, my little ham dancer.

997
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,620
Thanks for introducing me to the McElroy family of fine podcast

998
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,820
and more importantly for sharing your life with me and stuff.

999
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,260
Here's to many, many more happy years together.

1000
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
It's shaping up to be a pretty sweet ride.

1001
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,740
Lots of love now and forever. You're Hupsoned.

1002
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,340
Um, you said that word so right.

1003
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,700
Um.

1004
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,300
That's the way it's spelled. I'm just reading phonetically. Hupsoned.

1005
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,900
I gotta know what a ham dancer does and is.

1006
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,340
Oh, McElroy, our little ham dancer.

1007
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,660
I'm imagining a sort of competitive sport

1008
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,380
where a person dances some sort of beautiful interpretive dance,

1009
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,340
but the whole time you're throwing ham slices at them trying to get them to stick.

1010
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,140
Wait, you're throwing them at the dancer?

1011
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,860
The dancer's dancing with ham slices like ribbon dancing.

1012
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,780
No, no, no. You're throwing them at the dancer.

1013
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,020
And I think actually this doesn't make sense

1014
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,140
because it would have to be bologna

1015
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,700
because bologna would have a more uniform, um,

1016
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,260
like shape and aerodynamic properties and travel pattern.

1017
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,020
And it wouldn't be fair because like

1018
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,180
somebody could bring like a thinly sliced honey ham.

1019
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,500
It's just not the air resistance alone would stop that

1020
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,580
from attaching itself to the dancer, I think.

1021
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,260
We're going to have to really workshop this down with the boys in R&D.

1022
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,100
Yeah. For the great new sport they've been thinking of, bologna toss.

1023
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,580
Hey, MaxFun community.

1024
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,060
This is your friend Elizabeth Gilbert,

1025
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,220
author of You Pray Love and a bunch of other stuff.

1026
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,500
I am a longtime member, supporter, and devoted follower of Maximum Fun.

1027
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,660
And now finally I have my own podcast on the network.

1028
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,860
It's called Magic Lessons,

1029
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,340
and it is me coaching people through their creative issues and problems.

1030
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,660
This season, we have some amazing creators

1031
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,820
that we're helping through their joys and struggles

1032
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,420
of making something out of nothing.

1033
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,220
And then I bring in special guests like Glennon Doyle Melton,

1034
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,100
Brandon Stanton, Martha Beck, the poet Mark Nepo,

1035
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Michael Ian Black, Sarah Jones, Gary Scheingart,

1036
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,780
these amazing friends of mine to come and help coach these people

1037
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,220
so that they can get their work done.

1038
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,260
I hope you'll tune into it.

1039
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,780
It's called Magic Lessons, and it's all about love.

1040
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,500
All right, folks, as we mentioned at the top of the show,

1041
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,820
we are joined by very special guests.

1042
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,300
And right now, you can hear me on their podcast if I were you.

1043
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,180
We're joined by Jake and Amir.

1044
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,300
Applause.

1045
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,260
All right, thank you.

1046
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,540
Applause, right.

1047
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,740
I'm gonna have to demand actually that you finish this podcast

1048
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
before you go listen to that one.

1049
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,980
Like, I feel like you dance with the one that brought you

1050
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,940
and then you dance with-

1051
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,820
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1052
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah, because they don't know if we're funny or not yet.

1053
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,500
We haven't won them over yet.

1054
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,900
We are your rich, meaty dinner,

1055
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,420
and they're gonna be your delicious dessert, succulent dessert.

1056
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,100
If you guys were a dessert, what kind of dessert would you be?

1057
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, it's this kind of podcast.

1058
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,500
I love that.

1059
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,980
A flan bam thank you, ma'am.

1060
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,900
I've always said that about you.

1061
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,300
Yeah.

1062
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,020
Is that a treat served at the Guy Fieri's Kitchen and Grill?

1063
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,100
Yeah, it's at that and it's at a Denny's.

1064
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,700
It's at one Denny's in actually Cincinnati where you're moving to.

1065
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,420
Oh, that's nice.

1066
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,620
So you can actually order that yourself.

1067
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,260
Did they steal it from Guy Fieri's restaurant

1068
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
or did Guy Fieri steal it from this one Denny's in Cincinnati?

1069
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,140
It was actually spontaneously created at both at the same time.

1070
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,260
Parallel thinking.

1071
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,900
It combusted into one magical dessert.

1072
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,180
By the way, Guy Fieri.

1073
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,300
Fieri.

1074
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,860
Fieri.

1075
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,660
A little respect.

1076
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,740
That's actually Jake's brother.

1077
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,540
I think we're joined by Jake Fieri.

1078
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,740
He doesn't call you Travis Fieri.

1079
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,580
That's true, but that's not my name.

1080
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah.

1081
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,100
But I don't call you that.

1082
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,900
Yeah, yeah, that's why.

1083
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,540
It's true.

1084
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,260
It's one of the reasons.

1085
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,180
So you guys do a lot of stuff.

1086
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,620
That's true, we do.

1087
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,860
Videos and podcasts and video podcasts.

1088
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,940
What's harder, videos or podcasts?

1089
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,580
Oh.

1090
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,140
Videos, for sure.

1091
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,260
Yeah, videos.

1092
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,100
Well, sure, because we don't do many of those.

1093
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,140
We do a lot of podcasts.

1094
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,740
It seems like podcasting is harder.

1095
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,820
The laddies do a lot more podcasts than us.

1096
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,780
We just have the one.

1097
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,500
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1098
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,180
We're comparing one to one.

1099
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,540
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1100
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,820
If you're comparing 23 to one, maybe the podcasts.

1101
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,900
Yeah, if we're just comparing our lives to yours,

1102
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,260
yours are harder for sure.

1103
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,740
We also have wives and sometimes children,

1104
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,260
so that's a lot harder than probably any podcast or video.

1105
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,420
One child equals about eight podcasts, I bet.

1106
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,900
That's what you tell him every night before he goes to bed.

1107
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,780
Well, that actually fluctuates depending on the world market.

1108
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,100
All right.

1109
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,380
So do you know what?

1110
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,780
I literally had to come down to do this podcast

1111
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,020
from trying to get my baby to sleep for an hour and a half.

1112
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,820
Oh, my gosh.

1113
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,140
So how many podcasts?

1114
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,500
How many podcasts was she tonight?

1115
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,780
That's the last thing I whispered to her

1116
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,140
before she finally drifted off was,

1117
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,900
this was like two and a half podcasts.

1118
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,460
Yeah.

1119
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,500
Please rate and subscribe, Daddy, all right?

1120
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,140
We need your five stars.

1121
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,580
Retweet this next lullaby.

1122
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,420
We got questions from our listeners

1123
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,380
that we wanted to put to you gentlemen.

1124
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,020
You have provided us with a diverse list of expertise here,

1125
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,780
but we decided to focus on your expertise with Charles.

1126
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,420
How did you put it?

1127
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,940
Electronic communications?

1128
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,980
Digital communications.

1129
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,940
Digital communication.

1130
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,020
Well, you know, I waited until the last minute

1131
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,460
to put the call out for questions

1132
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,380
and I didn't want to make it too confusing.

1133
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,620
Yeah.

1134
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,180
You guys also professed a lot of expertise,

1135
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:41,060
specifically Jake's expertise, according to Amir, with pornography.

1136
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,860
Jake knows pornography really well.

1137
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,380
This is I'm quoting directly.

1138
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,140
Jake knows pornography really well.

1139
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,300
Like really well.

1140
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,820
Really, really well.

1141
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,500
See you soon, Amir.

1142
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:52,900
P.S.

1143
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,980
Really, really, really well.

1144
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,300
And honestly, I think he undersold it.

1145
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,660
It should have been 10 more PSs.

1146
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,940
Each more pornographic than the next.

1147
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,780
But I'm going to ask a first question here.

1148
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,580
I move a lot, read six cities in the past four years,

1149
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,100
including two and a half years in Europe,

1150
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,340
and therefore have made a lot of connections

1151
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,780
with people all over the world.

1152
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,980
I love a lot of these people,

1153
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,220
but with the distance, the time difference, et cetera,

1154
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,580
it isn't easy to keep in touch.

1155
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,700
Any advice on how to maintain long distance friendships?

1156
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,780
And that's from Disconnected in the Midwest.

1157
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
What are your thoughts on having different people

1158
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,700
in different area codes?

1159
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,580
I feel like the answer is just to be really active

1160
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,820
on social media, like kind of generally.

1161
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,140
So then you're not keeping up with any one,

1162
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,820
you know, person of person.

1163
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,300
You're keeping up with absolutely nobody.

1164
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,940
Yeah.

1165
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,580
It's like more people, but more loneliness.

1166
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,780
You just post on Instagram.

1167
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,980
You like a lot of photos.

1168
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,140
You like people's Facebook statuses.

1169
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,460
It's the bare minimum of human connection.

1170
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,100
Well, not even that.

1171
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,220
How many people do you exist?

1172
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,940
Social media is like the cotton candy of human interaction

1173
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,500
in that it looks like really great.

1174
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,660
And then you really sink your teeth into it.

1175
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,140
And then it's all gone.

1176
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,060
It wasn't anything at all.

1177
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,180
Yeah, now your teeth hurt.

1178
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,580
And also then the cotton candy says,

1179
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,100
it's going to murder you.

1180
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,980
And it doesn't get banned from being cotton candy anymore.

1181
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,820
OK, I think you were just harassed by someone

1182
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,260
on Snapchat or something.

1183
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,100
And you're taking it out on the candy.

1184
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,900
Or he was cyber bullied by like a vendor at a carnival.

1185
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,020
Did that happen?

1186
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,580
He didn't give a tip to the cotton candy man.

1187
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,340
I'm going to tweet about this later, you little thug.

1188
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,620
At bossmaster18 says.

1189
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,700
One of those dudes that did that,

1190
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,140
let me guess how much you weigh thing,

1191
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,900
was just very hateful.

1192
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,540
Like, I'm going to guess how much you weigh.

1193
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,060
And then they were like 240 pounds.

1194
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,940
I was like, what?

1195
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,580
No.

1196
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,700
And they're like, just kidding.

1197
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,140
Here's a stuffed animal.

1198
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,100
Get the fuck out of here.

1199
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,140
Don't really get super hateful till the end there.

1200
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,540
He didn't stick the landing.

1201
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,500
You also undersold it.

1202
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,220
Aren't you 310?

1203
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,940
Yeah, 310 on a good day.

1204
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,340
But if I've got a boxing match tomorrow,

1205
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,460
I can easily get that done at 290.

1206
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,420
How many stone?

1207
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,300
Some people wouldn't even think that 240 is that much.

1208
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,980
No, no.

1209
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,940
Real men.

1210
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,300
I have friends that have kind of dispersed.

1211
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,620
I feel like Facebook is sort of the cheap version of this, right?

1212
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,820
Like, you can still be supportive and sort of connected with them,

1213
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,900
but it's just like, that's just one click away.

1214
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,100
Hey, I like that.

1215
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,860
Yeah, but you're missing the magic of the pack your bags and move away.

1216
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,780
And that is every time you move,

1217
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,140
it's the perfect excuse to stop the friendships

1218
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,980
you don't actually care about.

1219
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,300
Yeah.

1220
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,740
Because you kind of get stuck in that

1221
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,100
where you like live in a city and you're like,

1222
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,380
yeah, I don't really like this guy,

1223
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,500
but he's in this group of friends.

1224
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,740
So I have to see him every time we hang out.

1225
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,780
Then you get to move.

1226
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,460
You don't have to do that shit anymore.

1227
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,340
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy though, right?

1228
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,140
Because I have friends who leave Austin

1229
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,620
or friends that I haven't seen in a long time

1230
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,740
because we grew up in Huntington

1231
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,980
and moved in different directions throughout the country.

1232
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,300
And then I'll get an email correspondence from them

1233
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,260
and I'll be like, oh man, this person is my friend.

1234
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,620
Like, you can invoke some friendship magic.

1235
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,380
Because all you gotta do is like one call

1236
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:03,940
and someone's like,

1237
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,700
you're so special.

1238
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,340
That's why I said the expectation is dirt.

1239
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,900
Like, it's so easy to like keep friendships going.

1240
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,220
Just call them once a year out of the blue.

1241
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,580
It's like, it was really good to hear from Steven today.

1242
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,140
I like a yearly call, a yearly check-in.

1243
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,540
You just set a little alert on every day

1244
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,620
after their birthday.

1245
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,580
Oh, that's when you're feeling lonely.

1246
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,660
Always late, always do it the day after.

1247
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,420
If you sound a little distracted at the end of the call,

1248
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,340
it's just because you're making your calendar appointment

1249
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,220
for the next year.

1250
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,660
Something really important happens in your life.

1251
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,580
Like, oh, I can't wait six and a half months

1252
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,780
to tell Steve about this.

1253
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,060
Yeah, so you call on their birthday

1254
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,140
and then the next day you call to check in

1255
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,700
because it's been a while since you had a non-birthday call

1256
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,780
with Colin.

1257
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,460
Did you see Deadpool?

1258
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,260
Yeah, dog, like that came out in February.

1259
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,020
Yeah, but your birthday's in January,

1260
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,380
so I haven't spoken to you then.

1261
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,380
What do you want from me?

1262
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,500
Is there a way to get people to take digital RSVPs seriously?

1263
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,940
I found that Facebook RSVPs are almost 100% unreliable.

1264
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,180
I thought meetup.com would be more reliant,

1265
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,260
but people seem to flake on these as well.

1266
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,500
Wouldn't saying yes become no,

1267
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,020
but I would rather inconvenience you

1268
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,620
by making you prepare twice as many guests slash attendees.

1269
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,380
Even group emails are failing.

1270
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,900
I organized both small lectures and a kickball team.

1271
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,620
Help!

1272
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,700
That's from RSVP in Richmond.

1273
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,180
I literally can't make people show up.

1274
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,020
I will have them verify and guarantee in digital writing.

1275
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,540
For my small lectures, I only need a dozen people.

1276
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,780
My friends are like trying to gather smoke.

1277
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,980
Please tell me what to do.

1278
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,260
And they get off on lying and saying they'll come out.

1279
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:52,820
And then they won't.

1280
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,020
Now you joke, but that is a fetish a lot of people have,

1281
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,540
which is garbage food.

1282
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,820
They love to know that like snacks and appetizers

1283
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,740
have been thrown in a garbage can somewhere

1284
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,980
because of their actions.

1285
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,420
The kickball is the worst one though.

1286
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,500
Like you just kick it towards the goal and you think,

1287
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,540
ah, Dylan RSVP, I know he's going to get this.

1288
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,060
Alley-oop it into the goal for me.

1289
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,020
Especially when the rich kids camp shows up to take you on

1290
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,540
and you don't have any of your poor

1291
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,460
but lovable friends with you to beat them.

1292
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,380
And you're like, I got 20 RSVPs.

1293
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,180
I don't know what happened.

1294
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,860
And then the rich kids beat you up.

1295
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,500
Yeah.

1296
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,540
Where's my motley crew of charming misfits?

1297
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,940
I got eight maybes and I figured I could tip the scales

1298
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,420
if I posted on the event's wall.

1299
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,180
I have a problem with who posts maybe in a Facebook event.

1300
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,700
Yeah, just don't post.

1301
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,060
You're maybe by default.

1302
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,540
I might be at every event in the world tonight.

1303
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,100
I don't know.

1304
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,980
I might be.

1305
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,980
Yeah, I guess I may be going.

1306
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,940
That's when it's forecast.

1307
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,580
It's like when it's forecasted, there's a 50% chance of rain.

1308
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,180
That's basically like, oh, I don't know.

1309
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,980
You're no more aware than you were before you checked the weather.

1310
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,540
It's 50%.

1311
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,780
Yeah, that's the least decisive you can be, right?

1312
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,420
Or is 10%.

1313
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,220
Now I'm confused philosophically.

1314
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,900
There's a 2% chance of rain.

1315
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,380
Yeah, that's more certain.

1316
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,540
I'm not willing to rule it out, but there's definitely-

1317
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,100
So I think 50% is maximum uncertainty.

1318
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,260
Any closer to 100 or 0 is slightly more certain.

1319
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,220
Yeah, you're 50-50.

1320
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,260
It's a coin flip.

1321
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,300
Yeah, you're guessing.

1322
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,460
That's what they should say.

1323
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,420
They should just be like, I don't know.

1324
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,380
There might be rain.

1325
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:31,620
Bye.

1326
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,260
That's my day, and I'm going to go enjoy my paycheck.

1327
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,860
I know it's 50-50.

1328
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,900
It could or it couldn't.

1329
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,260
I'm watching the fucking news so that you tell me yes or no.

1330
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:46,100
I think there's different strata of digital communications

1331
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,180
and how seriously you take them.

1332
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:53,780
So that if I say I'm having a birthday party on Facebook

1333
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,220
and I get 10 people saying, yeah, I'm in to that,

1334
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,860
but then I get a text message going and I'm saying,

1335
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,100
hey, I'm having this birthday party,

1336
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,860
and only five people respond to that,

1337
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,140
I know that five people are going to show up.

1338
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,380
For some reason, it being a text message,

1339
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,580
it makes it more believable in a way because you wouldn't-

1340
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,420
I'm not going to start being accountable for things

1341
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,540
I do on the internet.

1342
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,900
I do a lot of things on the internet.

1343
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,340
I say a lot of things on the internet.

1344
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,620
Really fucked up things.

1345
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,020
Yeah, really dark shit.

1346
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,860
The fingers and hands I use to type into garbage Twitter

1347
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,020
and say terrible just junk 24 hours a day

1348
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,540
are the same hands I use, same computer I use to RSVP to your thing.

1349
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,260
I said that on the internet.

1350
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,380
There's no accountability there.

1351
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,940
But then do you have another set of non-garbage hands

1352
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,140
that you use to type out your SMS messages to your friends?

1353
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,860
No, but I use my phone.

1354
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,740
That's different.

1355
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,620
That's my phone.

1356
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,260
I use my hands to type and my phone to text.

1357
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,900
And he puts on those gloves that have the reactive stuff

1358
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,980
on the tip of the fingers, those things.

1359
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,540
Those are good.

1360
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,140
Why do we do that?

1361
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,940
That's true though.

1362
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,980
When I text you something, my word is boned.

1363
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,940
If I say I'm going to come to your fucking concert on Facebook,

1364
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,860
I'm probably not going to.

1365
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,620
So what if it's an Android to iPhone green bubble?

1366
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,380
Is that just a man finding it's blue?

1367
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,660
That's just mocking.

1368
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,380
It's not real.

1369
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:19,620
Yeah.

1370
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,300
Well, to further Schrodinger this shit,

1371
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,300
in my experience, go through about 50% of the time.

1372
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,380
At that point, we're playing Calvin Ball.

1373
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,820
If it's green, what's it mean?

1374
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,500
If it's blue, you know it's true.

1375
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,700
That's what I've always said.

1376
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,740
That's what I've always said.

1377
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,860
You have a tattoo.

1378
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,820
That's so cool.

1379
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,180
It's of a pineapple, but still.

1380
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,700
Yeah, but if you look close.

1381
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,580
I just noticed it.

1382
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,300
Yeah, there it is.

1383
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,580
Use the cipher.

1384
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,020
Turn it 90 degrees to the left.

1385
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:46,660
It's glowing.

1386
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,660
Don't look directly at it.

1387
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,540
Look away from here.

1388
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,140
It's actually the Declaration of Independence.

1389
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,140
I've tried online dating, pretty much all of them,

1390
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,340
but have not had any luck.

1391
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,460
All of the relationships or all of the online dating?

1392
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,580
I've dated everyone.

1393
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,460
All of the sexes.

1394
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,740
Everybody.

1395
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,860
We're talking anything from a guy telling me he loves me after three dates

1396
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,540
to one sending me a link to his YouTube

1397
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,340
so I could see his rap videos before we met.

1398
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,940
FYI, we never ended up meeting.

1399
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,460
I guess there are bad raps.

1400
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,820
Or too good and they got nervous and they were intimidated.

1401
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,620
So my question is this.

1402
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,580
What am I doing wrong?

1403
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,300
What advice can you give me to attract nice, normal guys?

1404
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,260
That's from can Jake and Amir name me?

1405
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,620
P.S. I'm a girl.

1406
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,300
So you guys have to pick a name for this girl.

1407
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,780
All right, I'll say the first thing.

1408
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,500
You say the last.

1409
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:36,820
Yep.

1410
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,420
Jenica Twinditch.

1411
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,480
Wow.

1412
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,620
All right, next question.

1413
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,420
That was really good.

1414
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,500
It's what they call an alley-oop in the comedy game.

1415
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,820
So she's tried everything and she hasn't had any luck.

1416
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,340
Yeah, no luck on the online dating.

1417
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,820
There's no, the unfortunate thing is that she just needs to keep on trying.

1418
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,180
She has to keep on plugging.

1419
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,620
But what's the best practices?

1420
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,060
What's the tips and tricks?

1421
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,100
I think the only tip is that like almost 100% of guys on these apps suck.

1422
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,340
Right.

1423
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,340
So like, and you only need one.

1424
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,820
Like I, if you hear about people like, yeah, I married a lot, like 100 people.

1425
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,300
And now I found my soulmate and now we're married.

1426
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,980
It's like, okay, nobody cares about the 99 failures because you found the one good one.

1427
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,420
It's a numbers game.

1428
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,380
She just has only been out with maybe eight guys instead of 99.

1429
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,500
Well, she should get off.

1430
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,700
If she's on Tinder, she should switch to Bumble.

1431
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,740
Oh, that's a good upgrade.

1432
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,300
Or Hinge.

1433
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,660
Hinge, these are fake or these are real?

1434
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,140
You have to remember we're three very married guys.

1435
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,020
Yeah, yeah, those are real.

1436
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,300
But here's a couple of fake ones.

1437
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,660
You know, if Bumble doesn't work out, you should try out Juicy.

1438
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,980
Oh yeah, Juicy.

1439
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,980
But if Juicy's not good, try Not You.

1440
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,900
Oh yeah, Not You is really fun.

1441
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,740
Or you can try Tyka.

1442
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,300
T-I-Y-K-A-H.

1443
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,540
Yeah.

1444
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,900
So Bumble is one where you, when you match somebody, the girl is the only person that

1445
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,660
can initiate the conversation.

1446
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,940
Oh, that's so much.

1447
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,860
Of course, that solves so many problems.

1448
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,780
Yeah, so there's like a lot of douchebags who are like, ah, this app doesn't give me

1449
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,460
a way to prey on people.

1450
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:11,780
Yeah.

1451
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,340
Forget it.

1452
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,340
It weeds those people out.

1453
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:14,740
Yeah.

1454
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:19,060
And Hinge, I think, works with, it starts with the networks of your friends.

1455
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,820
So like, it sets you up with friends of friends or maybe friends of friends of friends.

1456
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,180
See, I don't actually like that one.

1457
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,820
I want complete, I want complete internet.

1458
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,660
The ability to just break away.

1459
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:28,980
Yeah.

1460
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,660
No, that's because like, you're friends with a lot of your exes on Facebook.

1461
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,060
So I don't want to have, I don't want to go, well, maybe I do actually.

1462
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,700
Yeah.

1463
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,020
But the guys on there might be nicer because, you know, they're friends of somebody, you

1464
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,780
know, rather than a complete stranger.

1465
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,980
But then how do you tell them that you've been a ghost the whole time and you are only

1466
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,980
allowed to walk the earth one week out of the year?

1467
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,780
I would do it in English, just like how you said.

1468
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,380
And also there's another exclusive dating app just for people who walk the earth just

1469
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,180
one day a year.

1470
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,300
Oh, yeah.

1471
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,140
It's called March 15th.

1472
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,420
What?

1473
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,460
That's the name of the app.

1474
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,260
Ides Brides.

1475
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,580
Yeah.

1476
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,300
Oh, wow.

1477
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,420
That was fast.

1478
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,220
Jesus, Travis.

1479
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,180
It's another tattoo.

1480
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,900
The Ides have it.

1481
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,180
I don't want to Andy Rooney all over this great guest segment, but I did get, I did

1482
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:21,860
online dating for like a minute in, when I lived in Chicago before I met, I know.

1483
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,420
Well, okay.

1484
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,620
It was several months.

1485
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,020
And back then you had like three options and like your match, which is like you got

1486
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,940
to pay, but it's usually a better quality of clientele.

1487
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,740
And then you had OK Cupid, which was like the wild, wild west.

1488
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,300
And you had farmers only.

1489
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,180
And you had farmers only.

1490
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:43,460
And then like some, I don't know what happened, but now there's like, there really is one

1491
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,900
for one a day ghosts.

1492
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,140
And there's one for like people who only want to use colonoscopy pictures as their

1493
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,860
profile pic.

1494
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,700
Like there's one for every single person so much so that there's like gotta be a

1495
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,860
dating app up there that only two people use.

1496
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,100
And it's like, oh, you then.

1497
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,140
They're perfect for each other.

1498
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,620
The colonoscopy pictures one is called Deep Connections.

1499
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,180
Wow.

1500
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,980
He's good.

1501
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,940
And you won't, you'll cut out the 45 minutes he took to think about that.

1502
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,660
Because he was shushing us for close to an hour.

1503
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,820
I'll get there, I'll get there.

1504
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,180
Hold on, hold on.

1505
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,140
Ides Brides.

1506
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:25,460
Speaking of, I recently saw the, speaking of all the dating apps, there is a, the

1507
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:31,700
room dating website for fans of the room started by a room director, Tommy Wiseau.

1508
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,060
Oh God.

1509
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,340
I was so down with it until that last part.

1510
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:36,980
Yeah.

1511
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,580
Just to, just to give you a quick sampling, I saw this on Tumblr.

1512
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:46,340
There's a list of the most popular interests on the room dating.com and they are as follows.

1513
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:55,540
Pizza, computer business, football, watching, DIY bio, biotechnology, Kitcher Williams,

1514
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,580
the room, beta breakers, young Nietzsche.

1515
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,380
Those are the most popular interests.

1516
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,060
The best of course is watching.

1517
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,100
Yeah, what's watching?

1518
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,380
How is that different than football?

1519
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,140
Just watching.

1520
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,900
And the other category and interest has living intensely.

1521
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,220
Do you think anybody's ever like at their wedding, somebody's like, tell me the story

1522
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,020
how you guys met again.

1523
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,460
Like, well, there's this online dating website that this unwrapped mummy made about his movie.

1524
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,260
It's called watching football, watching football.

1525
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:32,180
Is there a point at which everybody just has their own dating app that it's just them on

1526
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,940
it and they're just waiting for people to come join?

1527
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,500
Like it gets.

1528
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Welcome to lonely Steve.com.

1529
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,820
Lonely Steve Reynolds.com.

1530
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,620
That's good.

1531
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,220
That is kind of an interesting idea.

1532
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,580
If you just, if you were single, you like had a website with a picture of your face

1533
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,300
and people could just come and be like, I'll take you.

1534
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:47,860
Yeah.

1535
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,180
Sure.

1536
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:48,500
Done.

1537
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,780
Like, okay, I'll take you.

1538
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,780
This is my bespoke dating website.

1539
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,460
Welcome to, I want to date the lead singer of Smash Mouth.

1540
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,540
Let's see.

1541
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,980
What's the lead singer from Smash Mouth?

1542
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,020
Steve Harwell.

1543
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,260
Steve Harwell.

1544
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,820
That is it.

1545
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,180
I was going to guess Guy Fieri.

1546
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,740
Oh man, it's off days.

1547
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,740
It's like a Chris Gaines garden books kind of thing.

1548
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,740
It really does seem like they might be the same guy with one has bleached hair and the

1549
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,540
other one doesn't, right?

1550
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,540
I think actually lead singer of Smash Mouth bleached his hair.

1551
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,180
Okay.

1552
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,420
This is a very odd segue.

1553
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,180
I was on a dating app and I came across the profile for someone I immediately recognized

1554
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,580
as from a local band that I like a weird amount.

1555
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,100
I might have made a cross stitching of some of their lyrics and hung it over my bed.

1556
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,260
Yeah.

1557
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,980
Over the bed it says, hey, now you're an all star.

1558
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,020
Get your game on.

1559
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,940
I stare at it every morning to remind myself that I am an all star.

1560
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,140
It's a Shrek poster.

1561
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:47,940
Okay.

1562
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,820
I messaged him and pretended that I didn't recognize him so he wouldn't think I was creepy.

1563
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,100
Now we've been chatting, which is awesome, but I don't know how to come clean.

1564
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,100
It feels like it's too late.

1565
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,340
Do I have to tell him I know who he is and I'm weirdly into his band I am?

1566
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:08,100
Obviously, I'd take down the cross stitching before we hooked up or should I just accept

1567
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,980
that if I want this to be a thing, I must now live a lie.

1568
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,740
That's from Catfish, I guess.

1569
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,380
Wow.

1570
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,060
You never know if you don't know.

1571
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,140
You never know if you don't grow.

1572
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,900
You never shine if you don't glow.

1573
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,500
Oh yeah, you never shine if you don't glow.

1574
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,340
That's my good lyrics.

1575
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:22,980
Pretty good lyrics.

1576
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,220
It's interesting because you can shine and not glow.

1577
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,140
I would have thought that the easiest way would be to leave the cross stitch up the

1578
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,500
first time you hooked up.

1579
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:30,740
Yeah.

1580
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,940
And he's like, hey, what's the, don't worry about it.

1581
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,300
I don't want to interrupt the moment.

1582
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,380
And then later you're like, oh, I thought I mentioned.

1583
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,420
We did just have sex.

1584
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,100
So I guess everything is cool.

1585
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,300
Yeah, I would play it cool.

1586
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:46,180
I think you might as well not freak him out until he gets to know the real you.

1587
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,740
And then you're like, by the way, I'm a pretty big fan.

1588
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,100
And that's like on the honeymoon.

1589
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,220
That's when that comes out.

1590
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,020
You know, like-

1591
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:56,420
At what point is it a cute story and not a creep story?

1592
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,300
Yeah, I think you have to wait till you're in love and he's not going to leave.

1593
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,020
Oh yeah.

1594
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,820
Live the lie.

1595
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,540
Love the lie.

1596
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,780
This isn't a catfish, is it though?

1597
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,860
It's not a technical catfish.

1598
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:10,740
I don't think it's a technical catfish because she's not pretending to be someone she's not.

1599
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,060
She's just-

1600
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,500
Except for somebody who's not like-

1601
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,580
She's pretending he's someone he's not.

1602
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,060
Oh, it's reverse catfishing.

1603
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,660
This is a dog bird.

1604
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,620
Yeah, it's a dog.

1605
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,500
What, dogfish?

1606
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,060
Dog bird.

1607
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:21,540
Dog bird.

1608
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,100
That's what I said.

1609
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,100
The opposite of the catfish is a dog bird.

1610
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:24,740
Oh, all right.

1611
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,860
Yeah, I like a dog bird.

1612
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,780
You know, there's a long-

1613
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,500
They really are quick.

1614
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,420
There's a long game you can play here.

1615
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,580
And that is to just hang in there and don't say anything.

1616
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,140
Because if you do continue to date this person,

1617
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,140
eventually you will have to see their band so many fucking times

1618
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,540
that you actually will no longer be a fan.

1619
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:43,940
Yeah.

1620
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,700
It'll actually go full circle and it's like,

1621
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,540
if I have to hear them play Walking on the Sun one more fucking time,

1622
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,620
I'm going to attempt to walk on the sun myself and set myself alight.

1623
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,740
But you just hang in there long enough and you won't be a fan anymore.

1624
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,620
Yeah, two things.

1625
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,580
One, maybe you can cover up the cross-stitching with a poster that says hang in there, kitty.

1626
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,620
That's- that reminds you to hang in there long enough.

1627
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,140
And two, a little bit of an aside, as we record this podcast episode,

1628
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,180
Smash Mouth is doing a concert at The Grove right here in LA.

1629
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,060
Oh, Brian, what are we doing here?

1630
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,020
They fucking opened for us in Boston, basically.

1631
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,540
Oh, like at the Wilbur?

1632
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,980
They did a free show the night before that we missed,

1633
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,820
but they're like, they're getting around, I guess.

1634
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,940
But we did the next day get to hear someone talking about

1635
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,700
that they also saw Daughtry perform

1636
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:34,580
and how much better the free Smash Mouth show was than the free Daughtry show.

1637
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,980
They are, yeah, they're playing at a mall right now.

1638
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:42,180
So it's like American Girl Store, Aeropostal, and then Smash Mouth.

1639
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,900
How do you know Smash Mouth's tour schedule?

1640
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,700
Well, I know that they're at The Grove tonight.

1641
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,980
I'd go see Smash Mouth.

1642
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,740
I'd fucking absolutely go see them.

1643
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,100
For free in a mall?

1644
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,580
Yeah.

1645
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,180
Yeah, especially if I can hit the gap after.

1646
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,900
Let's see, we got another question here.

1647
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,660
I'm a grown ass woman who's been texting for over 10 years,

1648
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,740
but I have yet to figure out just how the hell to end a text conversation.

1649
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:11,460
If I have to go to work or sleep or drive, it's easy to just say that,

1650
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:15,380
but otherwise they all seem to stagger slowly towards an awkward, clumsy end.

1651
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,020
How do I know when the conversation is over?

1652
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,380
And that's from Rachel Rosen.

1653
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,260
They never end.

1654
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,780
It's a thread.

1655
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,900
It's a text conversation.

1656
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,100
I hate that answer.

1657
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,580
Yeah, I don't like that at all.

1658
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,700
Does that mean they get to respond at any time, Jake?

1659
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,260
Yeah.

1660
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,580
No, no, my time is my own.

1661
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,100
I know, but you don't have to.

1662
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,300
I mean, you don't have to respond right away.

1663
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:33,780
Yes, I do.

1664
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,420
I'll let texts hang forever and then I'll respond.

1665
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,820
Then I'll be like, oh, sorry, I was doing something.

1666
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,820
How do you end an email thread?

1667
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,180
Does it end or does it just naturally just find your account?

1668
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,700
Yeah, I just got a new account.

1669
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,900
I throw my computer away.

1670
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,420
I am.

1671
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,500
Every time someone texts me, I immediately respond

1672
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,420
because I'm afraid that if I do not, they will think I am dead.

1673
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,620
Yeah, I mean, that's tough.

1674
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,420
That's how my life works.

1675
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,020
It's a hard world that we have to live in.

1676
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:00,580
Yeah.

1677
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,060
I feel like there should be, you remember when William Shatner

1678
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,860
used to end all of his tweets with my best comma Bill,

1679
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,300
which was very, very good.

1680
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,140
And then he realized just how much of that sweet character space

1681
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,980
he was wasting with that.

1682
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,740
And so he just started doing MBB in all capital letters.

1683
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:24,260
I wish that there was like an emoji stamp of just like,

1684
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,580
you know, my best, Griffin.

1685
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,300
And then, you know, like Griffin has left the conversation.

1686
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,460
I wish you could also do that, just like Griffin has left

1687
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,980
this text message conversation.

1688
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,500
And people would see that in the chain.

1689
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,260
Going offline, like on AOL.

1690
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:40,260
I think the thumbs up emoji is a pretty great stamp, actually.

1691
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,060
Sure, yeah.

1692
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:47,700
I like, all of us are such popular internet commodities, right?

1693
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,580
I think we have the ability to push something,

1694
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,580
a new sort of standard of communication forward.

1695
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,340
I would like to put out there and just see if you guys

1696
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,700
pick it up and run with it.

1697
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,860
The idea that the monorail emoji can be like the stamp

1698
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,220
at the end of a conversation.

1699
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,900
As if to say, I'm going to get on this monorail

1700
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,220
and leave this conversation now.

1701
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,540
Well, that works until you go to Disney World.

1702
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,100
And then you're like, I'm about to get on the, oh shit.

1703
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,860
Oh shit, well, that's fine too.

1704
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,020
You don't want to get texts while you're in Disney World.

1705
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,260
Some of you would be like, hey, what are you up to?

1706
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,540
And you would just send them monorail.

1707
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,820
And they'd be like, oh, they're at Disney World.

1708
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,260
They don't want to get my fucking texts all day

1709
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,780
while they're on the new Star Wars ride.

1710
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,420
My wife's dad has figured out a pretty good solution to this.

1711
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,460
He ends every text to her with, love dad.

1712
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,660
So that way he never has to respond if you think about it.

1713
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,300
It's like, no, no, no.

1714
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,140
There was a signature at the end.

1715
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:41,860
I said, love dad.

1716
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,580
That was the end of it.

1717
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,700
That was the end of our text.

1718
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,620
That was the end of our conversation forever.

1719
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,780
Love dad monorail.

1720
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,900
Monorail, monorail.

1721
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,780
That's a good idea, Grim.

1722
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,980
It's more of a Shelbyville idea.

1723
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,780
But here are some questions from my dudes, Jake and Amir.

1724
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,220
What Tinder bio would make you swipe right?

1725
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,980
I don't know if that's the good one or the bad one.

1726
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,900
Oh, like what Tinder bio if we saw, I'll tell you what.

1727
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,780
No, Justin doesn't know which direction is the good one.

1728
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,980
Oh, that's the question.

1729
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,260
It depends who's swiping.

1730
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,020
Right is right.

1731
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:10,260
Oh, yeah.

1732
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,140
Okay, right is right.

1733
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,140
Okay, so what's a good Tinder bio?

1734
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,260
I don't like when it's like, hey, I'm five foot nine.

1735
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,020
You have to be taller than that.

1736
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,740
Sorry.

1737
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,460
Like demands or rules right off the bat.

1738
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:21,700
Right.

1739
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,740
If you blank, swipe left.

1740
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,660
That's what like a lot of bios say.

1741
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:33,140
I guess if I see a sincere song or movie quote,

1742
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,660
I'm like kind of a little bit turned off

1743
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,500
because like maybe that person takes themselves

1744
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,940
a little bit too seriously.

1745
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,660
What if they announced that they're like a black widow

1746
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,540
or like a praying mantis, but like in human form

1747
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,660
and they kill their mate?

1748
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,020
Is that a left or a right?

1749
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,380
Oh, that's that's sexy.

1750
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:52,020
Yeah, especially if you start to see like kind of like the

1751
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:52,420
what is it?

1752
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,500
The red hourglass symbol on their belly.

1753
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:56,740
Yeah.

1754
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,540
You start to realize, holy, that wasn't a joke.

1755
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:03,460
I am a literal spider and I'm using Tinder somehow.

1756
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:06,340
You dated a daddy long legs for a couple months.

1757
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,140
Is that correct?

1758
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:12,260
I hooked up with a mosquito once, which was so awesome of me.

1759
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,500
I've done that before.

1760
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,860
It's so draining.

1761
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:25,300
Oh, can you say I found that really draining?

1762
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,420
Because I just thought of a really quick witted.

1763
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,740
Yeah, I was pretty fast to figure it out.

1764
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,060
I just need a let's set it up one more time.

1765
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,220
Yeah.

1766
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,060
You know, I tried that once, but it was pretty draining.

1767
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,220
That's malarious.

1768
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,820
That is malaria.

1769
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,140
Yeah, okay.

1770
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,940
We'll edit that in.

1771
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,060
We'll drop that out.

1772
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,100
Yeah, how?

1773
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,540
There's a there's another thing.

1774
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,860
If you think of a better one, put it over malaria.

1775
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,180
Okay.

1776
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,060
Yeah, we have that.

1777
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,940
We have that Mission Impossible technology that Philip Seymour

1778
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,340
Hoffman tech where we can just play all the sentences you've

1779
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:02,740
said so far and have you say new completely original sentences.

1780
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,460
That's awesome.

1781
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,020
There's another question here from Lane.

1782
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,460
That one was also from Lane.

1783
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,380
How can I get my older coworkers to stop asking me how Snapchat works?

1784
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,020
Oh, man.

1785
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,780
Yeah, your parents came for your Facebook and now they're coming for Snapchat.

1786
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,100
Where do we go next?

1787
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,060
Young America.

1788
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,980
I'll meet y'all there.

1789
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,020
Where shall we retreat?

1790
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,460
Too late for old blooms.

1791
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,260
My knees aren't as good as they used to be.

1792
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:30,740
I have to pick up some Nexium then I'll meet you guys over there.

1793
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:34,100
Do you think it's because I just recently figured out what Snapchat

1794
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,260
how it works and I think it has to do with people like assume there

1795
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,780
must be something more to it.

1796
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,780
Yeah, it's very simple.

1797
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,500
That's why it took me so long because I was like, okay, but like,

1798
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,620
what do I do?

1799
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,820
What do you actually do with it?

1800
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,140
Because like I'm doing it and it's just people sending me pictures of

1801
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:49,860
cats.

1802
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,460
So like, what is it really?

1803
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,340
It's Pokemon Go for people who hate memories.

1804
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,540
I see my sister-in-law is 15 and sometimes I see her just like

1805
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,100
joylessly pounding through all the Snapchat she has just to like

1806
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,660
get him out of her way and clear clear it out.

1807
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:12,260
And I realized what it actually is is training for inbox adulthood.

1808
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,140
That's basically what it's like to go through your email as an adult.

1809
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,660
So they're like getting great training and how to just mindlessly

1810
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,380
dig through all the garbage that gets dumped on their desk every day.

1811
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:25,380
Can you imagine if that was how email worked if it disappeared after 24

1812
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:25,940
hours?

1813
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,140
Fuck that would be so good.

1814
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,260
Are you kidding me?

1815
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,780
Let's invent a new email app.

1816
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,140
Guys edit this part out.

1817
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,100
We're going to meet afterwards.

1818
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,980
Could you try to convince them that Snapchat is just taking pictures and

1819
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:43,220
texting them to people like they just text random snaps of themselves

1820
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,580
to friends and family and insist that they're Snapchatting.

1821
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,820
Just watch them do anything and say that's Snapchatting.

1822
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,660
Snapchat is native in your phone.

1823
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,140
Here it is.

1824
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,620
Snapchat is different for all of us.

1825
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,980
What is your Snapchat?

1826
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,420
What's your Snapchat story?

1827
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,780
How do you hashtag?

1828
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,780
How do you hashtag squad Snapchat?

1829
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,300
Let us know by answering below.

1830
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:07,380
You're using the calculator right now.

1831
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,220
There should be a text box at the bottom where you can input your answer.

1832
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,060
Now triple click on the go 30 app.

1833
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,340
I don't have any more questions.

1834
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:16,900
That's it.

1835
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,020
We ran out of questions.

1836
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,460
You guys really burned those down.

1837
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,020
We've solved all the issues in the world.

1838
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,380
Congratulations more or less.

1839
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,300
Yeah those were the most important ones to be sure.

1840
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,500
So what are you guys working on right now?

1841
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,660
What can people find more of you?

1842
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,020
Great question.

1843
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,620
The podcast is a big one.

1844
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:35,940
Our podcast If I Were You is on a network head gum that we started.

1845
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,580
So what's that podcast all about?

1846
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,900
That podcast is Jake and I, much like this podcast, giving advice.

1847
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,020
It does sound like this podcast a lot.

1848
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:46,660
Yeah.

1849
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:50,420
And I was on the most recent one so I might just do their podcast from now on and just

1850
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,220
leave you guys here.

1851
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,100
That'd be awesome.

1852
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,460
I would move into this room.

1853
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,340
Yeah we'll just, okay, I'll let my wife move to Cincinnati.

1854
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,780
I'll stay here in this apartment.

1855
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,740
We'll all live together.

1856
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,700
It's gonna be wacky.

1857
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:04,340
As the two podcasts become one, even worse podcast.

1858
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,180
We negatively affected each other.

1859
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,140
It was not good.

1860
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:07,620
Yeah.

1861
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,700
We got a relationship goal.

1862
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:15,140
It'll be like Full House if Danny was just a shithead and also didn't have any kids.

1863
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,100
Didn't have any family.

1864
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:20,980
So he was just a guy living with his brother and his friend.

1865
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:21,460
Yeah.

1866
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:21,700
Yeah.

1867
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,020
Okay.

1868
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,140
Brother-in-law and friend.

1869
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:23,860
All right perfect.

1870
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,980
Yeah sorry.

1871
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:30,420
The podcast is one big thing and then our network is another and then we have that show

1872
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,700
on Vimeo, Lonely and Horny, which is Jake and I sort of taking these questions and answers

1873
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,620
and putting it in a narrative setting.

1874
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,580
What if this guy didn't know about these podcasts?

1875
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,940
This clueless man trying to navigate dating in 2016.

1876
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:50,020
Yeah no we get questions like I'm cheating on my girlfriend at college and it's going

1877
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,580
great.

1878
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,740
How can I keep my girlfriend from finding out about my new college girlfriend?

1879
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,780
Good lord.

1880
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,660
Yeah people are people are not good.

1881
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:02,820
Have you thought about just calling the show just like bad and horny?

1882
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,060
Oh maybe season two.

1883
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,300
Or just like how about bad boy?

1884
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,660
Bad boy sounds almost too hot.

1885
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,100
Oh bad boys is taken.

1886
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,900
Yeah bad boy is fun.

1887
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,940
Not the singular.

1888
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:16,020
Yeah what if it was just Martin Lawrence?

1889
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,020
Call it bad boy and the only change is that you show up in a leather jacket and everything

1890
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,980
else is basically the same.

1891
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:27,220
There is an episode where Amir is wearing the Ryan Gosling jacket from Drive.

1892
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,580
The scorpion.

1893
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,420
Which was based on a podcast question where it's like a friend in our group keeps wearing

1894
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,180
this Ryan Gosling jacket from Drive.

1895
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,860
How do we tell him to stop?

1896
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:38,500
I thought you were saying Drive was based on a podcast question.

1897
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:44,820
I think it was loosely loosely inspired by this American life.

1898
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,380
Episode 12.

1899
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,380
Monorail.

1900
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,300
Monorail.

1901
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,220
Thank you so much to Jake and Amir for taking the time to talk with us.

1902
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,460
Nice nice fellas.

1903
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,260
Nice boys.

1904
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:58,980
Good boys.

1905
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,700
Real good boys.

1906
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,420
Real good boys.

1907
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:05,300
Want to remind you that you have now I'm going to give you an official

1908
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:13,860
time time remaining to order our awesome card game expansion for the game monikers.

1909
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,860
You have nine days left.

1910
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:20,260
OK for 10 bucks you're going to get the McElroy collection which it will be back up.

1911
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:25,940
If you don't know monikers it's a game kind of like sort of a take on charades but fun

1912
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,820
and it's a great party game.

1913
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,580
One of the very most fun ones you can play is widely available by the way.

1914
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,660
I saw it in the honey twice Virginia Target today so it is yeah it's out there.

1915
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:42,740
We haven't expanded that game full of jokes from the show and references from all the

1916
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,700
McElroy family of products that is available there for you.

1917
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,780
We wrote all the cards there's like 112 of them and it was really hard to write all of

1918
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,380
them because we didn't know what to say but we did it anyway because we never say die.

1919
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,580
We never give up and you can preorder it for 10 bucks and once this preorder period ends

1920
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,340
we have no plans at the moment to make more than that.

1921
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,180
So the preorders are all we're doing.

1922
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:12,100
So you'll want to preorder those and we'll have them out by the before the holiday season.

1923
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,620
I believe we're within the holiday season.

1924
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:18,980
They'll be there in time of the holidays but you have nine days left and go to McElroy

1925
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:26,260
collection.com preorder that and don't miss out because you'll be really sad and you know

1926
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,260
order a bunch of them then make a killing in the black market that's sure to emerge

1927
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,260
once the period ends.

1928
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,820
I mean we I guess that's fine.

1929
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,300
Well no don't don't do that it's fine but don't do that.

1930
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,540
It's fine but don't do that Link.

1931
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:48,500
A portion of those sales will also go to Grow Huntington that is a new urban farming project

1932
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,220
here in Huntington.

1933
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:54,740
It's supposed to fight addiction with urban farming giving people who are in addiction

1934
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:59,140
recovery a productive way to spend their energies and it's a really cool project.

1935
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:05,220
GrowHuntington.org by the way is the G-R-O-W GrowHuntington.org is the website if you want

1936
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:09,860
to check more information that but a portion of all sales from our expansion is going to

1937
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,860
go directly to them so you're helping out a good cause too.

1938
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,620

1939
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:18,980
