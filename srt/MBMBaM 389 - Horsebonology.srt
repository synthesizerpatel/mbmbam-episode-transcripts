1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother meat advice show for the modern era. What a

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
thrill it is to be back. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. I'm your

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:00,320
middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm the nasty man. Hey guys, it's me, the nasty man.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,280
Is nasty man a 30 under 30 media luminary?

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
Yeah, the nasty man, they didn't take that away. When I became nasty man,

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,480
I emailed Forbes just as a courtesy, like, hey, are you going to strip my title? You're

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,960
going to put an asterisk up there. Are you going to lower my banner and burn it in the

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
ceremonial fire? And they said, no nasty man. And I thought that was sweet that they did call me

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
the new name. They said, no nasty man, you can stay on the list. And they updated the website.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
So now it says the nasty man.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,440
It actually says Griffin McElroy, and it's all the same. And there's a huge asterisk. I mean,

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,240
like comically huge asterisk. And it says, just a fair warning, ladies and germs. He's a nasty man.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,160
Yeah. And it says germs in like,

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,120
comic sans to let you know that that part is in fact kind of a joke because I got the bronchitis

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,840
gang. I got it deep down, down, deep in my lungs. Hey, deep in my lungs. And it's bad. And did you

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,720
know that when you are a professional podcaster, you really just can't get bronchitis? It's like,

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,240
you're really not supposed to do it. And so when I saw the big bronchitis hose

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
hanging off of that abandoned warehouse, and I was like, I'm gonna take a huff on that.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,640
I should have known that it would have been a mistake. But I didn't, in curiosity,

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,240
made the cat get bronchitis. It's funny. I've been on a course. My wife got,

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,840
she has a name at Sydney. My wife got the flu because she works at the flu store,

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,480
pretty much. And she got the flu and she brought it home. So I went on a prophylactic dose of

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Tamiflu. So I was taking one Tamiflu a day. And that's very funny. Like we should talk about the

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,120
fact that it does sound like you're talking about a rubber or a Jimmy cap. It is hysterical. Yeah.

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,920
So I'm taking that. And it's the closest I've ever had to having a superpower. Like I'm just

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
wandering around town. I see a sick person and I run up and I embrace them. Yeah. Like,

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,640
because they haven't had touch. I would love a big embrace right now. I of course ask consent

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
first. And then I give them a huge bear hug. I just say like, it's going to be okay. And they're

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,400
like, but Justin, no, don't. And then I'm like, it's fine. It's fine. I also have like a sinus

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,160
infection, which is really cool. And what's really cool and is cool about it is that right now,

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,760
I don't know, 15 minutes ago, took my cough syrup that did have codeine in it. And I did take a

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,240
Sudafed, the max strength 24 hours one, because I do not fuck around. That real Welter White shit.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:49,760
And so my brain isn't one. For the most part, the two lobes are like the left side's team codeine.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,960
And it's like, let's just chill. And the right side is team Sudafed. And it's like, yeah, that

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,640
sounds pretty good. And so I'm excited for what the nasty man is going to bring to this episode.

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Travis, how's your health? Oh, my health is great. I'm recording this from a hotel room in San

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,200
Francisco for San Francisco Sketch Fest. Got any lotions? What? Lotions. Do you have them from the

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,040
hotel? Oh, yes. I'm going to steal those lotions. My voice is a little rough, but not from sickness,

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,520
just from just laughing and screaming in joy. Well, I'm glad to hear that, Trav. You big

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,120
shithead. Well, I also have something so important to tell everyone, Griffin. Lean in. Everybody lean

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,400
in. You don't want me that close to you, bud. The hotel room I'm in is 420. No. No, you did it.

46
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,400
It's the dream. I did it. I'm in the lead number. I live in it now. What was your exact reaction when

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,240
they told you? I think I just kept saying, really? Really? Like a child who had just come downstairs

48
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
on Christmas to find an Ewok Village playset below the tree. How many people at the Sketch

49
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Fest did you find an excuse to tell your hotel room? But in a not creepy way. Everyone was very

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,800
jealous, legitimately. I think just because I'm here with so many stand-up comics and performers

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,080
who are like, and you know they love weed. Yeah. And not only that, but if I had the go-to punch

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,120
line of I'm in the weed number, they would use it. But here I am using it on my recorded,

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,120
whimsical podcast with my brother and my brother and me. Yeah, I mean, it's a sure-fire hit. I

54
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
don't know if you can tell from our response, just like busting chucklenuts over here, but

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,280
it's a sure-fire. Really? They use that number? You know, the weed one? I would think it would be

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,640
like the 13th floor. Yes, when they skip the 13th floor, you think they would do that and it's like,

57
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,360
we can't put the weed number in here? Yeah. That's too funny. Anyway, so this is gonna be a real

58
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,200
episode of content. So should we do that? Yeah, I mean, yeah, for sure. Nobody's gonna say by the

59
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,840
time they get to the end of the episode, they won't be able to say, well, that wasn't an episode

60
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,720
of a podcast. I think it'll be pretty undeniable that what we've done here is put together a real

61
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:13,440
podcast episode in terms of content. Yeah. My wife and I recently moved to Michigan. My wife!

62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Okay, nasty man. My wife and I recently moved to Michigan where it is very cold in the wintertime.

63
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,000
Heard that. Shut up. To keep warm, my wife made a sweat dress, which is a full-length dress made

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,560
entirely of the material used to make sweatshirts and sweatpants. It's very warm, but we're not sure

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
whether it is appropriate to wear to work. Is my wife's new gray sweat dress appropriate work

66
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,560
attire or is it just a pajama dress? And that's Andrew from Ann Arbor. Last night, because of all

67
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
the football that happened, and it was apparently very good football. Yeah, a lot, TDs all over the

68
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,600
place. I heard at least eight teams get mentioned, which seemed wild to me. Yeah, and because of the

69
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,200
football, everything on all the channels was delayed like a half hour. And so that's why I

70
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,840
was accidentally watching Shark Tank. And Juicy watches that. I know you like to get up. I watch

71
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,880
every app, baby. You swim with the fishes. There was a gentleman who pitched a product there,

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,240
and fuck me, I guess it worked because here we are mentioning it on our nationally syndicated

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,040
podcast. Which, by the way, I'm so glad we finally got syndication. You know, that's where the money

74
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,840
is. There was a gentleman who pitched a product that was called Dude Robe, and it was kind of this.

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:38,800
It was sort of like fleece lined robe hoodie line, and it was called Dude Robe, which I thought was

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,400
not inclusive in the way that I like my products to be. It sounds like you kind of have developed

77
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,720
an alternative to Dude Robe, and I'm very much into that. Now, I will say the Sharks did pass

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,000
on Dude Robe. So if you're looking for sort of commercial viability of your new product,

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,040
and if their acumen is to be trusted, I don't think there's much of a profit future for you.

80
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Is it appropriate to wear to work? I mean, is it the material or the cut?

81
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah, the cut is so important. Is it a, you know, a, I know nothing about dresses. Oops. Cocktail

82
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
dress, you know, that's one. Wedding is another. Yeah, that's another. I don't think it's a wedding

83
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,080
dress, although I would be very into that sort of casual approach. Dude, a pajamas wedding, please

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,880
hook me up. If I'm staying up past, you know, 11 anyway, then I would love to just be in my off

85
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,280
court buddies ready for this sack. I love your ingenuity here, your wife's ingenuity here though.

86
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,600
I think this could really take off. You think it's not about whether or not, here's the thing.

87
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,680
Don't wear it to work because your new job is sweat dress. Yeah. Your new job is promoting

88
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,880
and selling this apparently commercially unviable product, and I'm a little worried about that.

89
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,320
The real issue is that this gentleman wanted $220 for each dude robe, which seems like a lot,

90
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,520
sir. Yeah, I'm not going to pay that much for, I wouldn't pay $10 for a product if it was called

91
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,520
dude robe. If it was just called- Dude anything. Dude anything is a tough putt. Dude repellent,

92
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,400
maybe I would buy that. Yeah. I will also say, Andrew, you and your wife, I think,

93
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,640
need to do a little brainstorming because I think maybe sweat dress doesn't trip off the tongue.

94
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So I was going to say this, Travis, and then I started thinking, if you think about it,

95
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,560
sweatpants is like, that's gross. It's really gross. But that's established at this point.

96
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,400
It's a little late for us to change sweatpants and sweatshirts. It's established, but it's like,

97
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,360
if you think about it for just a second, and that's what we're all about here,

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm your brother, my brother and me, sort of like deeper, like diving deeper into

99
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,160
the things that we just sort of pass by. Sweatpants. That's gross.

100
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Yeah, it sounds like some sort of rag you would use for cleaning, and that's why it is the nasty

101
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:17,600
man's favorite sort of garment. I love this though. Can you just staple on a normal dress fabric to

102
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
the outside of it, and then it's your dark secret? And if the answer is yes, then my follow-up

103
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,240
question is, can you come to my house and do that to literally every piece of clothing that I own?

104
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,960
Because yes, well, sweatpants is a nasty word. It's the one you want to be wearing.

105
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,240
What about some embroidery or maybe some bedazzling could happen there to sort of kick

106
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,720
it up a little bit so you keep the comfort factor, but it's also like a little, like maybe you use

107
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
gemstones to write the word fancy on it. And that's how you know a clothes is

108
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
fancy, Justin. And I'm glad you brought this up. That's why at the Met Gala,

109
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,320
it's fancy, fancy. It's like Juice Newton all up in that place. Speaking of the Met Gala,

110
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
maybe we just get Heidi wearing one of these things.

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,640
I need to stop for a second and figure out why you said the words Juice Newton a second ago.

112
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,720
I also was wondering this. No, don't help him.

113
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,200
What was Juice Newton's sort of contribution? Was it a phonetic sort of fun you were having,

114
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
or was there a deeper level that maybe just kind of whizzed over my head? What was sort of the idea

115
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,560
with saying that? And I guess the real question that's on the tips of everyone's lips is that

116
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,160
I confused Juice Newton and Reba McEntire. Okay, she did fancy. Okay. Yes. Yes. See?

117
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,400
Thank you, Nasty Man. We got inside the bit. So happy to finally have that one.

118
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,920
What was Juice Newton's jam? Juice Newton's jam.

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,760
I just Googled Juice Newton's jam. Guys, should we delay the episode recording of the podcast?

120
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,240
Juice Newton, best song. Queen of Hearts. Playing with the Queen of Hearts. That one was what I was

121
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,480
thinking of. Anyway, you guys want to Yahoo? Sure, yeah.

122
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,520
Juice Newton's a very talented performer. You bet.

123
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,320
And this is a very talented Yahoo that was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson. Thank you,

124
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:26,240
Seth. It's Yahoo Answers user Skyler asks, can a ghost charge a phone? Asking because people who

125
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,080
live to my house claim we have a ghost here. I usually charge my phone with a wireless charger.

126
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,920
So I get notification when I place it on the charger. I was standing in the doorway of the

127
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,920
room where the ghost resides and that's in quotes. And suddenly and randomly I get a pop up about my

128
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,280
phone connected to the wireless charger and then phase as it detects the charger is off. However,

129
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,880
my phone was in my hands as I was browsing the net. Or this is a real person by the way,

130
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,280
and they did say browsing the net. Did a ghost energy charge my phone as it walked by?

131
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:01,680
Or is it just weird technical malfunction? Well, of the two, I think you've got to lean ghosts

132
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,160
on this one if you're applying a skeptical eye. I mean, those electronics cost a lot of money

133
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,960
and it seems weird that they would just malfunction. I remember watching the movie Contact but only

134
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,600
kind of watching it and there was a whole bit in there about Occam's razor and I wasn't paying

135
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,440
and I wasn't paying attention to it. But I think what it meant is that the ghost did charge the

136
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,760
phone in this one. And can I say what a friendly specter that would like? I would want that specter.

137
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,000
I would want to, you know, maybe not murder somebody in a terrible passion, which is how

138
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,440
ghosts get born. But I will say like there have been times where I've been at like a music festival

139
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,840
or at the airport and I forgot to charge my phone where I could use a little,

140
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,520
you know, a little Casper floating around my Samsung and making sure that it gets juiced up.

141
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Now that brings up a question though. Is it platform agnostic? Are there certain ghouls

142
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,200
that charge Samsung devices? Are there certain geists that charge Apple devices?

143
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,120
I mean, I think the key here was introducing wireless charging because ghosts are wireless.

144
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,640
So they hear that and they're like, well, I can fuck with that for sure.

145
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,920
I mean, it's not old, not old ghosts, though. Old ghosts have sort of an they got sort of

146
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,840
an iron lung situation where they do need to be plugged into the wall to go.

147
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
Can you imagine being a ghost?

148
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,520
That's why a lot of times, you know, you'll be watching Ghost Adventures and they'll be like,

149
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,000
oh, see that extension cord just kind of whipping around. That's an old, old ghost.

150
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,160
Can you imagine the frustration of being a ghost who like you have been charging

151
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,800
someone's phone for them and then they come home and like Apple has changed like the

152
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,840
charging outlet on the phone and you're like, oh, what? But I'm not I'm not compatible with

153
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
lightning chargers.

154
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,600
Fucking Joni. What am I supposed to do now?

155
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm just going to knock over some dishes.

156
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,160
Stinker.

157
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
What? Stinker. I'm going to smash dishes till you get a new Samsung.

158
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,680
I love the Samsung devices. It's more open platform. Don't give Tim any more money.

159
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,240
Tim Cook.

160
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Ghosts are more compatible with the Samsung platform.

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,400
It's just the frickin truth, people, because Tim locks it up so you can't play all your,

162
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
you know, emulators and stuff.

163
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
Ghosts can't get in it.

164
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
Ghosts can't get in it.

165
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,440
This was definitely a good spectral activity. I don't know what else to say.

166
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm so convinced of it now. It was. Yeah, it wasn't a fluke.

167
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,880
This is a dead person that got in there and helped you out with a few extra percentage

168
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
points that you need to get through the day.

169
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Hey, it's bad enough that Tim made it waterproof, so no squished ghosts can get into it.

170
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Like, all the wet ghosts that are around, they can't get into your phone at all.

171
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,080
What if they need to get in there to help solve a crime for some well-meaning neighborhood kids?

172
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,360
They can't get in it.

173
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
What if Ghost Rider got on your phone and was like,

174
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
Jesus Christ, there's a lot of pornography on here.

175
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
I don't actually want to help with this anymore.

176
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,200
Why is the symbol for Waze a ghost? This is just a thing I've always wondered.

177
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,600
The app Waze, the little icon is a ghost with wheels? Never understood it.

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,080
Is that an app with a ghost in it? It used to be that way.

179
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,440
No, it was a car. And they're freaking ghosts.

180
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,120
Did the car crash and turn into a ghost? Another possibility.

181
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
Do cars have ghosts?

182
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
We can't even start to bust into that one, but yes, especially Teslas.

183
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,280
All-electric hybrid cars? Extremely haunted.

184
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,320
Extremely haunted, but that's how you get to drive from San Francisco to Phoenix on one charge.

185
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,800
You have four or five ghosts sort of pit crewing you there inside the trunk of the one.

186
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,760
So here's my question. I'm walking around my everyday life, then I die.

187
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,900
No.

188
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,680
I know, but in a terrible fashion with lots of unfinished business, and I become a ghost.

189
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
So my question is, does that mean that now, right now, sitting here,

190
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I have a ghost inside me, and so everyone is haunted?

191
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,920
Oh, wow. And now we've got to it, folks.

192
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,640
300-some episodes in. The big philosophical one.

193
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,320
Is all of us haunted with a literal ghost inside of us,

194
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,520
just waiting to jump out and do a scare when we die?

195
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
The answer is probably. The answer is probably.

196
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,960
All the great theologians and philosophers throughout time agree.

197
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,840
Descartes, the other ones agree. There's definitely a little ghost in there.

198
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,480
Is it scary?

199
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,040
Is it definitely or probably? Is it probably or definitely?

200
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,840
Yeah, probably.

201
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
That's why on Descartes' deathbed, he was like,

202
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,440
here it probably comes, and then he died, and then a ghost probably came out.

203
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,880
Okay, Griffin, with all due respect, that's all nonsense and hogwashing bullshit.

204
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
Ghosts are not piloting our bodies.

205
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,360
Ghosts are created from somebody dying in a terrible passion.

206
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,560
So you don't, you don't automa- it's like a chemical, you know, with eggs.

207
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
Like, if you have an- imagine an egg.

208
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay, wait, give me a second. Give me a second. Let me get there.

209
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,680
Let me imagine an egg. Hold on.

210
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,980
Yum!

211
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,940
Yum!

212
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,420
Okay, imagine an egg, okay?

213
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,300
Uh-huh.

214
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,820
Wait, hold on. Am I still imagining the first egg or am I imagining a second egg?

215
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,580
So this is the same egg, okay?

216
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,620
Mmm, yummy!

217
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,660
You crack the egg and crack it into a bowl, okay?

218
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,540
Oh, I'm sorry. I was picturing a hard-boiled egg. Can we start over?

219
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,020
Can we start over?

220
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,220
Yeah, start over. Go get a fresh one. Bring it back out, okay?

221
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,020
What should I do with this- what should I do with this fucking first egg, though?

222
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,620
Because I can't just have a bunch of eggs rattle around my brain.

223
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,820
You keep your egg. Your egg was fresh and organic.

224
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,580
So keep your egg. Travis has got a new one.

225
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,340
Mine's a turtle egg. Should I have said that?

226
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,540
Any egg is fine. Let's say it's a chicken egg.

227
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,820
Any egg will do.

228
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,700
Okay, so crack the egg into a bowl.

229
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,220
Slow down, slow down.

230
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,140
Justin, Baby Turtle came out!

231
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,020
Is this the analogy?

232
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,700
No, it didn't. It's a chicken egg. Just, like, play along with me here, okay?

233
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,940
You didn't tell me to picture a bowl.

234
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,100
Let me warn you now. This isn't that funny.

235
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,740
So if we prolong getting to the end of it,

236
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,220
like, there's not- it's not gonna be worth the payoff.

237
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,620
So you just have to let me just talk you through this, okay?

238
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,060
So you crack an egg into a bowl, okay?

239
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,020
Got it.

240
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,260
And you take the shell and you throw it in the trash, right?

241
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,860
Or you compost it. It's up to you.

242
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,260
I don't know your setup. Did you do that?

243
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,620
Yes.

244
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,140
Yeah, let me imagine a trash can.

245
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,380
Okay.

246
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Okay, so what's in the bowl?

247
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,380
Egg.

248
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,660
Egg.

249
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,460
An egg, right?

250
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,420
Yes.

251
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,540
Okay, so that's weird.

252
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,300
All right, you guys want a yahoo?

253
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,620
Because if you think about it,

254
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,340
it was an egg when it had the shell on it.

255
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,900
You crack it into a bowl, and in the bowl you have an egg.

256
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,460
Yeah.

257
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,620
But it doesn't have a shell. So which is it?

258
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,180
Yeah, so-

259
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,260
And I think ghosts are kind of like that.

260
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Okay, but hold on, Justin. You have just proven my point,

261
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,100
which is the egg is inside the shell the whole time.

262
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,820
And so what you're saying is these fleshy sacks in which we live are the shell,

263
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,340
and the ghost is the human.

264
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,740
I'm saying it's a prison.

265
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm saying our bodies are prisons for ghosts.

266
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,940
Okay, because you started this saying that ghosts were not just in there piloting us around,

267
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,100
but rather now you're saying they're trapped.

268
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,900
You shut down any meet Dave jokes that we could have made,

269
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,540
which was fucking selfish of you.

270
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,420
Yeah, but then I listened to my egg thing, and I was like,

271
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,620
fuck, that's a good point.

272
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,500
Hey, speaking of eggs,

273
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,260
I think that maybe we should take a second and explore some

274
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,860
farm wisdom. Farm wisdom.

275
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,620
If you crack an egg into a bowl, it's still an egg.

276
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,580
Farm wisdom.

277
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,740
Welcome to Farm Wisdom.

278
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,940
Nice.

279
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,940
It's a segment on the show that we do when people send in farm wisdom.

280
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,220
And this one was sent in by Becca Fenn. Thank you, Becca.

281
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:14,980
And I guess before we get started, a quick straw poll from you, my brothers in the audience.

282
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,580
It's appropriate for Farm Wisdom.

283
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,620
Yeah, all good.

284
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,220
So put straw in Comic Sans so you know it's a joke.

285
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,420
And the question I have for you, Justin and Travis,

286
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,580
just straw poll hands up, yes or no vote, is if horses have fingers?

287
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,220
No, they have hooves?

288
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,660
Yeah, I'm going to say no.

289
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,260
Well, Becca says, in the spirit of Collaborating and thinking about these beautiful horse

290
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,220
friends pulling carts, I thought you'd like to know a little bit about their legs.

291
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
I come from rural Vermont, so I'm familiar with a lot of farm wisdom.

292
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,260
But finding this out today fucked me up.

293
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,900
Yeah, by the way, heads up, this is going to fuck you right up.

294
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,900
Horses' legs are giant fingers.

295
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,220
The reason they have such poor health outcomes after breaking or otherwise injuring their

296
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,020
legs is because their legs are actually hyper-specialized fingers.

297
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,580
Similar to human fingers, there's very little muscle supporting the bones,

298
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,420
just a lot of cartilage and tendons and whatnot.

299
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,620
This is from a Quora thing about if horses have fingers.

300
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,100
And the answer is, horrifyingly, yes.

301
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,940
The carpus is called the knee, but it is anatomically the wrist.

302
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,540
From the carpus down, the horse has just three finger bones.

303
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,260
The large one in the middle is called the cannon bone, and it goes all the way to the

304
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,180
fetlock joint, which looks like the horse's ankle.

305
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,020
The two vestigial finger bones descending from the carpus and providing lateral support

306
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,780
to the cannon are called splint bones.

307
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,820
The part you might think of as the horse's foot is called the hoof.

308
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,940
I didn't really need that part.

309
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,420
The hoof wall is a particularly tough fingernail material with sensitive tissue beneath it,

310
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,260
just as your fingernail has, and the smallest part of the phalanx bones within it,

311
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,660
anatomically comparable to the tip of your finger.

312
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,340
The oldest equines, this is additional information if your being's not completely freaked out,

313
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,580
the oldest equines have five toes.

314
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,940
As the species evolved, horses gradually dropped their digit number down to four,

315
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,540
three, and then just one.

316
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,380
Like their ancient ancestors, modern horses have the genes for five toes.

317
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,940
Get the fuck out.

318
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,500
So these are fingers.

319
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:16,660
When you look at a horse, I want you to imagine head, neck, torso, and then four galloping,

320
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:24,260
cantering, powerful, long, fuzzy fingers with ending in fingernails that are the hooves,

321
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,540
which by the way, horseshoes sound real, real bad now.

322
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,780
They sounded not great before, the whole process looked kind of yucky.

323
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,940
I understand it does provide protection.

324
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,340
Yeah, I mean, when you think about it, you probably don't want to be walking around

325
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,420
directly on your fingernails, but yes, these are fingers now that are on these horses,

326
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,260
so it's fine, now you can do it with your hand, or you make your hand down in a little

327
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,180
walking monster, and that's kind of what a horse is if you think about a big finger

328
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,780
having a walk monster, so.

329
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Wait, so their head is a finger too?

330
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,900
No, you goofball, the head's a head.

331
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,300
The rest of it's though fingers all the way down.

332
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,020
But if you had asked me Griffin, I can't assume that anymore, because you would have

333
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,980
asked me ten minutes ago and I told you their legs were legs.

334
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,020
And I was like, their fingers are legs, and their tail is a finger, and their head is

335
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,900
a finger.

336
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,900
The number one test scientists use for something's a finger is if you cut it off, does the thing

337
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,620
die?

338
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,820
And if you cut a horse's head off, it will die, so it can't be a finger.

339
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,700
It can't possibly be a finger.

340
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,260
And also, if you point at a horse and say, hey, do they point their hand at you or their

341
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,940
head at you, you know what I mean?

342
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,420
Yeah.

343
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,860
So if you go to a horse and you're like, give me five, and the horse is like, no!

344
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,620
Yeah, that's why.

345
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,140
No, please, anything, but I can never leave a bro hanging, but please.

346
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,980
If my math is correct though, each thing, each appendage, we'll call it that, has four

347
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,420
finger bones in it.

348
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,380
So if you asked a horse for five, it would get pretty confused.

349
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,140
It could give you eight or four, otherwise it's going to give you a full five, or a full

350
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,820
four, and that's going to destroy your hand, by the way, and then try to figure out a way

351
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,660
to just get one finger bone up on you.

352
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,900
Ah, this is a challenging episode, just mentally.

353
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,580
One, are we all haunted?

354
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,620
Two, horses are running around on their fingers.

355
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,980
Loving it, though.

356
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,740
But they're not.

357
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,260
This is linguistic nonsense.

358
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,140
They're legs.

359
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,660
You can't just say something's fingers.

360
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,860
We all know what that is.

361
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Didn't know you were a horse boneologist.

362
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,060
No, I'm just saying you can't.

363
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Oh, it's interesting, Justin, I didn't know.

364
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,820
You're so talented in so many different ways.

365
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,300
I didn't know you also had a horse boneology degree.

366
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,980
Where did you study?

367
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,740
Where did you study, Justin, Johns Hopkins?

368
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,660
The School of Hard Knocks.

369
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,580
I've learned the hard way.

370
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,020
Them's his legs, they're not fingers.

371
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,540
You can't trick me.

372
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,420
How come Johns Hopkins is called Johns Hopkins?

373
00:25:50,420 --> 00:26:02,580
Is it referring, does John possess a Hopkins?

374
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,860
Christ almighty.

375
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,980
Anyway, should we go to the money zone?

376
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,260
His parents named him Johns.

377
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,740
All right.

378
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,580
Multiple.

379
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,460
Multiple, so here comes the money zone.

380
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,740
Hey folks, if you want to freshen up your look for the new year,

381
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,660
but you have no idea where to start,

382
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,420
I cannot recommend Stitch Fix enough.

383
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
It's a new way to shop for clothes.

384
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,620
They do all the work for you.

385
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,300
You go online, you answer some questions

386
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,540
about your favorite styles and budget.

387
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,740
And it doesn't say fabric allergies on here,

388
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,660
but I'm assuming that's part of it.

389
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,420
And your personal stylist will pick five pieces

390
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,220
based on your preference.

391
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
They send you a box and you look at the stuff,

392
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,980
you try the stuff on and you only keep the stuff that you,

393
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,980
or you only pay for the stuff you keep.

394
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,100
The rest of the stuff you put in a bag that comes with the box

395
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,260
and the bag is all pre-postage paid and everything.

396
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,460
And then you ship it right back to them,

397
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,180
the stuff you don't like.

398
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,300
And they take your feedback on the box

399
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,980
and then they do better next time,

400
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,060
which I think is something we should all strive to do

401
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,620
and follow in Stitch Fix's example.

402
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,220
It's not a subscription thing.

403
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,300
You just pay for the clothes that you like.

404
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,740
And I have been using the service for a long time.

405
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,620
Sid's been using it for maternity clothes

406
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,340
and they've sent a lot of stuff to her that she's really dug.

407
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,740
It's hard to find really great maternity stuff,

408
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,340
but they have a really good hit rate.

409
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,100
I think the last box she kept everything.

410
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,580
Yeah, my last two boxes I've kept everything.

411
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
I'm wearing a Stitch Fix shirt right now.

412
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,220
They are, I don't know how they like,

413
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,380
I mean, you fill out a survey about what your style is

414
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,380
and your fit and everything,

415
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,260
but it's kind of like magic how well they've got me kind of pegged.

416
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,060
And it's interesting too, the stuff that you,

417
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,100
there's been some stuff where I'm like, I'm not so sure.

418
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,260
And I tried on like, yeah, I guess this is me,

419
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,500
or this is the me I'm going to strive to be.

420
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,660
This is an aspirational shirt.

421
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,340
Sure, you can get started now at stitchfix.com slash my brother

422

One more time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

425
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,540
I want to tell you about Clip.

426
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,940
Let's be honest, none of us do enough for our teeth.

427
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,540
Our teeth have always been there for us.

428
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,780
Us chomping stuff, biting stuff, protecting our tongue.

429
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,260
And yeah, what do we do for them?

430
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,300
Well, it's time.

431
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,620
It's time for you to work together with your teeth.

432
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,740
20 collaborate team, work with your teeth.

433
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,500
You should brush your teeth at least two minutes twice a day,

434
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,380
but do you?

435
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,900
Oh my God, no.

436
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,500
Wowsers, no.

437
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,020
Yeah.

438
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,140
That's four minutes.

439
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,980
What am I supposed to, come on.

440
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,260
I'm a busy man.

441
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,420
So you're going to want to find out about Clip.

442
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,340
So Clip is the new electric toothbrush.

443
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,740
It packs just the right amount of vibrations and everything

444
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,420
into a very slim, cool looking, stylish design

445
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,820
at a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes.

446
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,020
I am a big fan.

447
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,540
It has now become the brush I both use every day

448
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,860
and travel with because it is compact enough

449
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,020
to bring your electric toothbrush with you

450
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,940
without feeling like it's taking up all kinds of room.

451
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,260
It's a sexy little electric toothbrush.

452
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,060
Yeah, it's great.

453
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,060
And it's got a mount that goes right on the mirror.

454
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,380
So it keeps it up off of everything

455
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,860
and leaves you some counter space there.

456
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,460
And you can get new brush heads delivered every three months

457
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,180

I have a jumbotron here.

467
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,180
And that is that I want you all to search for matinee manatees

468
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,780
on iTunes, Stitcher, or at matineemanatees.com.

469
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,620
If you listen to podcasts to help you fall asleep,

470
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,180
but you keep getting startled or you wind up staying awake

471
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,100
because you don't want to miss anything interesting,

472
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,260
you may want to try matinee manatees.

473
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,580
It's a podcast that is specifically designed

474
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,620
to fall asleep to.

475
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,860
It's hosted underwater.

476
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,940
And I don't know if that's true or not, but if it is,

477
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,740
fuck yeah, by a rotating cast of half ton aquatic mammals.

478
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,220
They mix the peaceful sounds of marine ambience

479
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,580
with low pitch discussions of old movies you've already seen.

480
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,300
And the episodes are real long to help you fall asleep.

481
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,580
It's free on iTunes, Stitcher, or once again,

482
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,300
at matineemanatees.com.

483
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,940
I would like to take this opportunity.

484
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,940
It's a message from your friendly neighborhood mods

485
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,860
and it's for Awful Squad Jr.

486
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,900
Hell yeah.

487
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,620
And all the honorary wigglers out there.

488
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,580
Ready up, wigglers.

489
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,780
It's time to spread some laughs.

490
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,700
Can you believe we have a community of people

491
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,380
playing video games who all rank goofs higher than skills?

492
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,420
Here's to many more good, good bike stunts,

493
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,060
impromptu turn coding, hilarious ragdolls,

494
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,820
and making peace using only wiggles.

495
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,860
We love and support you and are sending you all the virtual

496
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,340
hugs.

497
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,620
That's from Awful Squad Jr., which is the,

498
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,500
I would say, partner in a web series called Awful Squad

499
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
that we do over at Polygon.

500
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,220
You should go check that out.

501
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,180
It's so much fun.

502
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,420
They're half, they're literally half the reason

503
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,020
that it's such a fun thing to do.

504
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,860
They are the 100 and the one versus 100 of Awful Squad.

505
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,820
I think they're more than half.

506
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,540
I think they're the majority share.

507
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,700
It's a really, really fun community and a really cool

508
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,860
thing that we do live every Tuesday.

509
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,620
I have one more Jumbotron here.

510
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,420
This one's for Sam and Nick, and it's from Anita, who says,

511
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,620
congrats on your engagement.

512
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,380
Since I introduced you to the McElroys

513
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,420
and deserve partial credit for the events that introduced you

514
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,260
to each other, I thought this is the perfect way

515
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,380
to send my love.

516
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,660
I'm thrilled you found each other,

517
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,380
and I truly can't wait to rage at your wedding.

518
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,260
Here's to a long and joyous future together.

519
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,980
I'm hoping they're using rage in like the colloquial fun,

520
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,020
like let's day rage and not like I'm going to be infected

521
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,900
with the rage virus.

522
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,660
And I am going to attack your grandma.

523
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,260
I'm going to come right at her, and you will not

524
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
be able to stop me.

525
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,940
And then it'll spread.

526
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,460
It always spreads.

527
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,780
And I'm sorry, but I am looking forward to it.

528
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,900
I am looking forward to it.

529
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,780
It's going to be fun.

530
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,740
I'm thrilled about it.

531
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,340
Your grandma's not going to be.

532
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,740
Podcasts.

533
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,620
Podcasts.

534
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,420
Podcasts.

535
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,500
They're audio programs that tell smart stories

536
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,380
in innovative ways using editing techniques like this.

537
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,940
Like this.

538
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,500
Like this.

539
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,060
Like this.

540
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,180
But let's face it, all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

541
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,740
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

542
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,020
It's so stupid.

543
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,300
It's just two stupid dinguses being dumb idiot jerks

544
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,180
for 90 minutes.

545
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,660
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

546
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,460
The stupid show that smart people love.

547
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,820
Find it on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

548
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,700
How about a Yahoo?

549
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,460
I'd love that, Griffin.

550
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,260
Thank you so much.

551
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,700
Yeah, this is one from Level 9000.

552
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,540
Yadru drew a Drew Davenport.

553
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,260
Thank you, Drew.

554
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,100
Yadru answers user D who asks.

555
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,500
And this is not the setup for a joke, but it could be.

556
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Isn't everything we do on this podcast that?

557
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,660
Anyway, why do people from New Jersey ski in their jeans?

558
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,420
I don't know.

559
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,460
Why do they?

560
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,500
I fucking just said.

561
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,860
Why do people from New Jersey ski in their jeans?

562
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,460
I don't know.

563
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,500
Why do they?

564
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,180
This is tough.

565
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,820
This is tough.

566
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,140
I mean, it's tough because Travis is antagonizing me.

567
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,580
But it's also you got to put on a sort of nylon snow

568
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,020
resistant ski pants.

569
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,820
Because if not the snow, oh, OK.

570
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,260
Well, Travis have at it.

571
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,300
What if you got some really cool looking jeans?

572
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,380
No, I know you want to show the jeans off.

573
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,340
But there's a time and a place.

574
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,580
I don't think when somebody goes zoom and past you

575
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,020
on those beautiful slippery rails that we do call skis.

576
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,860
At, you know, however fast skis go, like 60 miles an hour.

577
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,340
I don't think they're going to stop and smell the jeans.

578
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,980
You know what I mean?

579
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,860
The only reason you couldn't wear jeans is because you're

580
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,420
going to fall into the snow and get them wet.

581
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:24,820
Correct?

582
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,620
Correct.

583
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,260
I mean, yes.

584
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,020
That's if you fall down.

585
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,780
Yes, thank you.

586
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,740
This is what I'm saying.

587
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,220
If I'm going to carve the slopes and I'm not going to fall,

588
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,460
I can wear whatever the fuck I want.

589
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,700
So New Jerseyans, you're saying, are just exemplary skiers.

590
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,260
They do not.

591
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,900
They're just great skiers who can wear jeans because they're

592
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,540
not going to fall and get their jeans all shitty with snow.

593
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,540
They're going to carve the slopes.

594
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,740
They're going to land.

595
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,020
They're going to zoom right into the lodge or whatever

596
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,620
and have some French onion soup and just kick it.

597
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,500
It's like if you were like a duelist who only wore white

598
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,660
because you know you won't show blood.

599
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,700
You know, that kind of thing.

600
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,660
Yeah, thank you.

601
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,460
Yes.

602
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,340
Yes, this is the New Jersey shot call.

603
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,740
Yeah.

604
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,140
Of like, I shall not be falling down.

605
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,300
I will meet you at the bottom at, I don't know, either the lodge

606
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,060
or maybe like bubblegum shrimp.

607
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,580
We haven't made plans.

608
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,500
Damn, that's a cool ski mountain if it's got a bubblegum shrimp on it.

609
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,780
Well, you know, you get hungry and you want to get some, I don't know.

610
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,660
I've never been to a bubblegum shrimp, but I assume there's shrimp there.

611
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,700
Yeah, there's a lot of it, Trav.

612
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,740
I can confirm.

613
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,380
I probably will come as a great surprise to literally no one

614
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,220
that I have been to a bubblegum shrimp company before.

615
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,260
Yeah, Trav, they got shrimp.

616
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,460
They got all kinds of shrimp.

617
00:35:48,260 --> 00:36:02,020
Steamed shrimp, hot shrimp, good shrimp, little shrimp, aggressive shrimp,

618
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,060
boneless shrimp.

619
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,500
Okay, listen, straight up, if you own a restaurant,

620
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,740
please start advertising boneless shrimp.

621
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,140
Please, please.

622
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,420
It's important that you do this.

623
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,300
That's so funny.

624
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:22,020
I went skiing one time and I didn't take, they had classes,

625
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,180
which I think in retrospect, I wish I had forced the issue.

626
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,860
I asked about them and no one in my party wanted to do the classes

627
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,660
because they all loved it out there.

628
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,860
Was yours also a church thing?

629
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,100
Because I've only been once and it was a church thing.

630
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,540
No, it was a bunch of junior doctors and I was getting out there

631
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,260
and I basically was at the top of the hill without knowledge

632
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,140
of how to ski.

633
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,100
I knew pizza and french fries was one where if you make your skis

634
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,820
like french fries, you go and if you make them like in a triangle

635
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,100
that could hold pizza, did they stop?

636
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,460
I'm sorry, they told me that and then what I did after that

637
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:08,580
was I just slid down the hill on my belly one time.

638
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,020
Like a graceful penguin?

639
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,980
No, sort of like a dead penguin and I just slid down the hill

640
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,700
like an idiot and then I pounded my way back up in my stupid boots

641
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,940
back up to the place we were staying and the relief I felt

642
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,180
knowing that the skiing was a part of my life was behind me

643
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,900
and that there would never be skiing in the future

644
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,940
is a relief that I have not experienced before or since.

645
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,740
And I've kind of thought like should I go skiing again

646
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,220
just so I can experience the exhilaration and luxury

647
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,060
of the feeling of not skiing immediately after skiing.

648
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,900
Um, I went once with Church and to continue Justin's sort of wonderful analogy earlier

649
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,020
I had myself a veritable pizza party.

650
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,940
It was the only way I did it.

651
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,140
I got yelled at.

652
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,660
I tried a medium, what is it, blue circle slope

653
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,540
and I got yelled at by somebody who's zooming by a lot faster

654
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,140
like you need to learn how to do this.

655
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,460
Which I would have.

656
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,580
Why is that yelling though?

657
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,820
I think the problem is if they called

658
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,100
I was like in high school

659
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,740
and I wasn't going to get on something called a bunny slope

660
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,980
to learn how to do the thing.

661
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,780
I wish it was called something a little bit less insulting for you know teens.

662
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,700
Something like you know the cool the cool slope or the um the

663
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,420
oh shit if they had called it the ice trial

664
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,300
and it's like oh if you want to ride if you want to take one of the trails

665
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,060
you have to pass the ice trial

666
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,820
and then maybe you got a badge at the end of it

667
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,020
um that would definitely be my jam.

668
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,940
Um but yeah there's a lot of problems with skiing.

669
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,780
I have never been uh skiing and and the reason is

670
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,100
um I like to be very introspective

671
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,340
think about myself what do I know about myself

672
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,180
what are my core truths

673
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,980
and one of those core truths is that I have zero interest in going skiing.

674
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,100
I just there's nothing I don't like being outside my house when it's cold

675
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:33,540
let alone looking down an incline uh at what must be almost certain death

676
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,100
and it's cold and I have things tied to my feet.

677
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,620
If not death certain like certain wet jeans

678
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,340
because now I think back I was wearing my jeans my jeans.

679
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,860
Yes and they weren't those were jinkos at the time so.

680
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,460
They were probably jinkos Travis yes

681
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,020
and the problem with jinkos is that they look fucking excellent obviously.

682
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,980
Sure sure sure.

683
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:01,620
But those big leg holes are essentially welcoming snow mouths

684
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:07,300
that just gobble the stuff up and deposit it directly on my calves thighs and business

685
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,180
and I I'm just saying at the end of the day I took off the jinkos

686
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,060
there were two perfectly sized sort of leg molds inside of it made out of snow

687
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,500
uh you could have made the bottom half of a very convincing griffin snowman

688
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,580
and not just convincing anatomically correct.

689
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,380
In fact my wiener got really weird.

690
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:33,060
Oh got it okay yeah thanks because I was I was not sure what you were uh sort of talking about.

691
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,820
Yeah the snow made it really weird.

692
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,100
How about another question?

693
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,740
Give you a weird dick yeah that's great um here is one.

694
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,620
Every time my family gets together they mention this woman named Ann.

695
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,460
They never say anything that Ann has said or done just how much they hate her.

696
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,860
I used to theorize to my cousins about who Ann could be

697
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,580
but once they turned 16 they started talking about Ann too.

698
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,340
Why do all the members of my massive extended family who are 16 and over

699
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,340
know and hate this woman?

700
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,300
What did Ann do?

701
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,380
Should I ask who she is or wait a year so that I turn 16?

702
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,540
Please help from mystified about myth members in Massachusetts.

703
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:16,340
What what could your what could you possibly learn at what what's why would there be an age gate on

704
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,940
that the only thing I can think is that your family is all vampires

705
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,420
and that when you turn 16 you learn the truth of the matter and that Ann is it and is it well

706
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:32,980
possibly there's a libel situation as Ann Rice talks a bunch of shit or Ann is just a you know

707
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,260
famous vampire hunter.

708
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,780
Or vice versa it might be that Ann is a famous vampire your family is a family of hunters.

709
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,820
I don't want to speculate because it could go either way and you're the next generation

710
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,380
maybe you will finally be the one who takes down Ann.

711
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,180
Have you noticed your family gets smaller and smaller every year?

712
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,180
I mean here's the thing it's got to be that the family's vampire hunters and Ann's a vampire

713
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,660
because we know that this person's not a vampire because they typed this thing into a computer

714
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:06,260
and emailed it and I'm I get real fucked up if I think about a vampire who can also use like

715
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,900
search the web.

716
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,500
Yeah I can't deal with that.

717
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,060
I don't really like that I don't think that happens in Twilight's where you know Edward's

718
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,820
like hold on let me get up if he did it would be on like Alta Vista or some like old bullshit

719
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:25,460
but yeah and you never see you know Castlevania Dracula's like hold up gotta look up a you know

720
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,460
a new recipe for poison.

721
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,460
Yesterday my wife was watching the last 20 minutes of the last Twilight movie.

722
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,100
How was it?

723
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:43,620
And I was emptying the dishwasher and she kept telling me context on the things that

724
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,340
were happening and I couldn't leave because I was emptying the dishwasher so I was a

725
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:56,740
captive audience for just seeing the last end of this movie with like a bunch of lore

726
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,860
and it didn't seem real to me that they had gotten to that point in four movies.

727
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:07,060
It seemed like maybe the 30th movie would contain all the incredible truths.

728
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,620
Did you know the werewolf in that movies got decided to marry a little girl?

729
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,780
That's a thing he imprinted on her and said he was going to marry her and she's like

730
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,660
six?

731
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,020
That's no good.

732
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,980
That's in it.

733
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,860
That's in it.

734
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,140
What other reason could Ann be a bad person that you don't know about until you turn 16?

735
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,660
Why is your birthright knowing the truth about Ann?

736
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,620
I've got it.

737
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:36,580
Ann is just the name that they hear until they turn 16 when the true name is revealed,

738
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,300
Cthulhu.

739
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,460
All right.

740
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,980
So they hate the deep one.

741
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,180
I assume this is an unspeakable one kind of scenario, yes.

742
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,500
Maybe Ann is code for you.

743
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,660
They can't trust you with the secret until you're 16 and then boy that is going to be

744
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,380
a rough sweet 16 party though.

745
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,100
Happy birthday.

746
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,940
Ann.

747
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,500
No that's not it.

748
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,460
That's probably not that one.

749
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,260
That's not it.

750
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,740
I do enjoy, I'm still hung up on the idea of vampire hunters whose idea of hunting the

751
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,220
one vampire they know about is just to sit around and talk shit about them.

752
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,660
Because that is, if you think about it, vampire hunters do have downtime.

753
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:22,820
That is almost certainly like, man fucking Dracula, that guy, I can't even with that

754
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,620
idiot anymore.

755
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,580
I hate his guts.

756
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,220
Real talk, if I wake up in the middle of the night from a horrible vision where I find

757
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,180
out that I'm the chosen one, once in a generation I'm supposed to go out and slay vampires.

758
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,620
I got like a lot of stuff going on right now and also don't want to be killed by a vampire

759
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,380
because I would not be good at this.

760
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,460
This would also probably be my M.O.

761
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,500
I would not go out staking hand holy water in my, you know, a camelback or something

762
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,820
like that, ready to slay, because again, I don't want to be dead from a vampire bites.

763
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,140
So what I'd probably do is just like, hey, I don't know if you guys know about vampires,

764
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,340
but they are real buttholes.

765
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,580
This would sort of, I would get on Twitter and subtweet vampires before I go out and

766
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,860
try, because I also don't want to, is it still murder?

767
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,100
Because my answer is yeah, kind of.

768
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,540
Yeah, probably.

769
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,100
You could go to their bank and just be like, hey, this guy's a vampire.

770
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Oh yeah, that's a great way to kill them.

771
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,020
Just blow up their spot everywhere.

772
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,940
Like they're just like walking down the street and you're just driving slowly next to them

773
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,380
in your car with the windows down like, hey everybody, that's a vampire.

774
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,220
I'm sorry, but Dr. Acula has been coming to this branch for many years and we've never

775
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,820
had any problems with him.

776
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,500
We're going to have to ask you to leave.

777
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,300
He's a treasured, he's a treasured customer.

778
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,580
Juice, will you do this next question before we wrap up?

779
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,900
Happily, Griff.

780
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:53,940
Just now, in the airport restroom, a man a few urinals down from me stopped peeing, moved

781
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,100
one urinal over to his left, and then continued to pee.

782
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,740
Why did he do this?

783
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,740
That's from befuddled in the bathroom.

784
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,220
Let's just, let's just, should we just round Robin?

785
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,340
Just list a reason why you would do, because we've all been there.

786
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,100
The urinal was full.

787
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,100
Urinal's full, Travis says.

788
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,980
Justin, you got one?

789
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,140
He saw that there was a new urinal cake in the next one, and he just couldn't resist

790
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,820
the temptation to destroy it.

791
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,660
Yeah, I mean, urinal spider.

792
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,860
You see one, you gotta go.

793
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,900
It's probably one of those three.

794
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,900
I mean, it also could be a game in Japan.

795
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,740
When I was there for my honeymoon, there's some places that have like games built into

796
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,700
the toilet where, you know, you pee and maybe you're peeing on a target, or it's measuring

797
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,300
your sort of fluid, and then you get a high score.

798
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:51,620
Maybe he already beat the game, wanted a fresh save file, maybe a new game plus, pop one

799
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,100
over.

800
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,860
Maybe it's a different game, he's like, oh no, this one's a driving game, I want a

801
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,900
punching game.

802
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,220
So he went over to play a different piss game.

803
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,420
Maybe he realized right in the middle that it wasn't a urinal at all, but in fact a

804
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,140
mimic who was trying to eat him.

805
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,980
A nasty mimic who loves pee pee.

806
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,660
Yeah, maybe he filled it up.

807
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,020
Travis already did that one.

808
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,100
That was the first one I said, yeah.

809
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,060
Yeah, I'm just agreeing.

810
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,940
I just wanted to lend a little credence to my brother.

811
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,260
Yeah.

812
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,660
Maybe he did fill it up.

813
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,140
Maybe there's borrowers in it, and they didn't see him at first.

814
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,820
He was like, oh, sorry little friend.

815
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,780
I'm sorry buddy, let me scoot one over.

816
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
Piss, piss, piss, oh there's one in here too.

817
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,340
It's okay.

818
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,980
I knew it was risky when I moved in here, I knew that this was going to come with the

819
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,620
territory.

820
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,220
Maybe his goal was to try to pee in all of them in the same thing, and he just didn't,

821
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,220
like he didn't pace himself well enough.

822
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,540
I mean, I mean that's, maybe he was playing Pokemon Go, and there was a ghastly like four

823
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,660
feet to his left.

824
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,420
Did you see a Guinness World Records person next to him like, you'll never do it.

825
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,460
Not with that stream.

826
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:15,220
Question, do you enclose your zone before you transfer, or do you let her ride?

827
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,380
Well, they, I mean, they said they stopped peeing, which is good.

828
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,260
That's a mercy.

829
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,020
Yeah, that's, obviously you want that to be done, but what I'm saying is there's a few

830
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,980
steps after that.

831
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,740
Yeah, you gotta make the audible whoop sound as you move over to the next one.

832
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:38,340
Do you, I'm asking if he put his zone away before he transferred, or was it a full, was

833
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,140
he trying to keep his combo meter going maybe, and he wanted to, you know, complete the gap?

834
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,620
I assume it went like this.

835
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:50,500
He left it out, he looked to his left, he was like, Doug, Doug, is that you here?

836
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,420
And then went over to that one and started peeing in it.

837
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,260
I don't think he put his wiener away, but I do think he recognized the urinal and thought

838
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,820
it would be rude to not go pee in it.

839
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,260
Yeah, it's gotta be that, or the borrower, or you filled it up.

840
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,460
It's either he, right, it's either he had filled it up, there was a borrower in it,

841
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,100
or he recognized the urinal and called it by name.

842
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,860
If you know the urinal and you're friends with it enough to know its name, then do you

843
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,620
not want to do the business in it?

844
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,100
You don't want to deny the urinal its purpose.

845
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,780
I mean, that's what it's there for.

846
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,580
Yes, it's true.

847
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:30,180
Man, everything's just so political these days.

848
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,300
Well, friends, I think we can all agree that this was a podcast.

849
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:43,540
Yep.

850
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,020
We made a guarantee at the beginning.

851
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,460
Yeah, started, now it's gonna end.

852
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,060
There's a beginning, middle, end, and the middle was when we sold advertisements, and

853
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,220
then before was everything before it, and the end was everything after it, and then

854
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,700
you heard roughly an hour of three people talking.

855
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,380
That's a podcast.

856
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,740
That's a podcast, baby.

857
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,460
Cut and print.

858
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,060
Walk us out, Juice.

859
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,660
Thank you for listening.

860
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,100
We really appreciate you.

861
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:14,420
Sorry about, I mean everything, but sickness and traveling and everything, and we missed

862
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,660
last week, and we're just real sorry, but we'll do better.

863
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,140
We'll do a better job in 2018.

864
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,900
I don't know, because I've been sick literally every day of 2018 so far.

865
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:31,300
So it would be, I miss having a good, cool, functioning, non-medicine sort of poisoned

866
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,620
brain.

867
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,300
Thank you to everybody who's sending questions.

868
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,820
We've never done that before, but thanks.

869
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,060
You all saved me from having to wander into that fucking pit myself, and I sure do appreciate

870
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,300
you.

871
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:53,380
Mabimbanatmaximumfund.org is the address if you want to send a query there.

872
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,060
In that same vein, I want to say thank you to everybody who came out at Sketchfest to

873
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,580
see my shows.

874
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,780
They all went very well.

875
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,780
Thank you for coming.

876
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:08,100
I wanted to let everybody know that January 25th, I'm going to be in the John and Jean

877
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,220
show in Brooklyn.

878
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,820
I'll be tweeting about that.

879
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,860
Jesus, Travis.

880
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,380
Yeah, it's John Hodgman and Jean Grey, and I'm going to do that.

881
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,580
And then we have the cruise coming up in February, February 18th through the 25th.

882
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,660
JoCo Cruise.

883
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,340
It's going to be super fun.

884
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,860
You can find that out at JOCocruise.com.

885
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,820
I want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

They got awesome shows that you're just going to love that my brothers are going to tell

888
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,900
you about because I'm about to cough, which I'm going to edit out.

889
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,180
Heat Rocks.

890
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,980
There's a new one on the network.

891
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,940
From John Roderick.

892
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,540
Friendly Fire, it is called, where they talk about war movies.

893
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,460
I was just talking with Roderick about it yesterday.

894
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,580
It sounds super interesting.

895
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,300
How is that dude?

896
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,860
I miss him.

897
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,060
Doing good.

898
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,740
He was sick for a couple days, but now he's better and has a really cool shirt.

899
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,740
He got that for-

900
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,820
Do you get cool shirts?

901
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,420
If you get a cool shirt when you get over an illness, then I've got the coolest shirt

902
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,340
ever coming my way.

903
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,860
Hey, speaking of John Roderick, thanks to that good dude for letting us use our theme

904
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,780
song, It's a Departure, off the Long Winter's album, Putting the Days to Bed.

905
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,380
It's a really, really fantastic album that you're just going to love.

906
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,020
And that's going to do it for us, folks, this week.

907
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,140
So thank you for listening.

908
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,260
And Griffin's got one final Yahoo to sort of take us out on.

909
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,420
Yeah, this final one was sent in by Merit Palmer.

910
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:28,980
Thank you, Merit.

911
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,860
It's Yahoo Answers user GangsterGhost who asks,

912
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:37,940
Do you believe in Da Vinci code?

913
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

914
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,660
I'm Travis McElroy.

915
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,940
I'm Griffin McElroy.

916
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,460
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

917
00:52:43,460 --> 00:53:02,660
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

918
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,300
to you about our new podcast on Maximum Fun, Friendly Fire.

919
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,420
The podcast about action movies and Sylvester Stallone specifically.

920
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,140
It's the show I've always wanted to make.

921
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,580
It is not that.

922
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,940
It is not that at all.

923
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,620
It's a little bit more of a war movie podcast.

924
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,780
It's not a little bit more of a war movie podcast.

925
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,340
It is explicitly a war movie podcast.

926
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:42,260
We look at them from all sides and put them in a variety of cultural and historical contexts

927
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,380
such that anyone is going to enjoy this show.

928
00:53:45,380 --> 00:54:12,660
So go grab Friendly Fire every Friday on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.
