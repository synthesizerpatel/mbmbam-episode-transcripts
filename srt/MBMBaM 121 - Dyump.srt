1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,480
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, where we have sprung into fall.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,080
Is that? We sprung a leak. I fell into fall. You trip, you trip forward.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,120
Hold on. We jumped up, we reached for fall, we missed it. There's a lot of leaves and branches

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,320
and debris on the ground, and so you slip and trip forward into the fall hour, and then in the spring,

9
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,200
you have to wind the springs of your clock backwards. I will make a confession for you

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:28,960
right now. Everyone has that childhood, that fun childhood memory of their poppy or their peepums

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:38,320
raking up a big pile of autumnal leaves and leaping into that pile. I have no memory of

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:46,480
ever doing that, and I am worried the ship has sailed. I'm worried that if I were to now leap

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,600
into a pile of leaves, I would be perhaps given a lollipop. Now what you do is you you rake up

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,000
the pile of leaves and then you just like slowly lay down in it and go to sleep. Yeah, it's a good

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,520
that it's a good place for a nap or actually not because uh one time the last time I jumped into a

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,640
pile of leaves in Ironton, Ohio, a spider bit me right on the hand and it swelled up and I never

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,600
even looked at leaves ever again. I can't look at leaves. Take note, Ironton, Ohio. Full of spiders.

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah. You're on watch. You're on notice from Griffin because of the spiders. For arachnids.

19
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,280
I think the true celebration is the the arrival of the PSL in your closest SB. It's back. It's

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,440
back. It's better. Griffin, can I tell you? Thicker than ever. Can I tell you guys? I hate

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,440
to make this confession to you but I'm I for me in my heart in terms of fall beverage consumption

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,000
it the PSL has been dethroned. What? But um it's been dethroned by the SCM. Yeah. I'm

23
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm way. A salted caramel macchiato. A salted caramel mocha. I'm way. I'm so close. Way way into it.

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah. It's good but it can't beat that pumpkiny flavor. I love the pumpkin. It has probably a leg

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,320
up on the PSL in one department and that is that the PSL really does get thicker every year. It is

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,840
pretty much uh it's a it's a pumpkinish sludge. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like a squash

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,520
based triple thick milkshake. There's a half a pumpkin in every cup. I think that. It's bad.

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:40,160
Part of the problem is that I'm 31 almost 32 and I am I can appreciate complex flavor combinations

29
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,960
like salt in coffee and I think that you guys maybe aren't there yet. That's the new thing

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,680
isn't it? Is salty. I can't eat. I can't like I ate a crunch bar the other day and it was covered

31
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,680
in cardamom and I was like ah what come on whatever happened to the good old days where chocolate was

32
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,880
chocolate and we didn't need to you know throw sea salt all over we didn't have to every every

33
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,520
snickers bar comes with the comes with one of those pepper grinders and you just put coat it

34
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,480
in some sort of strange spice get out of here with that good old days. Sometimes I feel sometimes I

35
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
feel like the salted chocolate is like an emperor's new clothes kind of thing where they're just

36
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,960
waiting for some child to be like hey you ruined chocolate hey you put salt on my chocolate sir

37
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,240
yeah you're right it really is for I feel like it's for 20 and 30 somethings who are like I know

38
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,200
it's salty chocolate can you believe it I'm eating it too. I'm really only one of the Hershey bar

39
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,040
can I just get some fucking chocolate please. Yeah that is that is it is a testament I think to

40
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:51,600
to where our society is at now that we can't even us indulging ourselves has become so unspectacular

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
that we have to like we have to put a put irony into our into our desserts. Well it's like there

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
must be slight amount of punishment it's like that idea when they put like the the like red pepper

43
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,760
in in chocolate and you bite down and it's like oh and there's cayenne in it yeah like can I just

44
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,720
get some fucking chocolate why do I have to punish myself and like oh I want to vomit thanks for the

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,960
chocolate. I think they're like I think all the ad wizards were like uh seems like uh this this

46
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,440
chocolate's pretty unhealthy can we get some sodium up in it like a bunch of it how much

47
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,240
sodium can we get in this. So much you can feel it between your teeth great. So you've been listening

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:39,040
to three Andy Rooney's talk about candy. Did we introduce ourselves? No. Okay I'm your oldest

49
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,400
brother Justin Andy Rooney McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis Andrew Rooney McElroy.

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,440
I am Griffin McElroy lead singer of the band Rooney. I think it I think Andrew Rooney should

51
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,720
have been the main villain in Bioshock. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his own brow?

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:10,880
No says the man. Would you kindly tell me why there's so many Japanese? Where Andrew Rooney?

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Where are there in Japan? Yeah it's where they are. I was I was I was in my private hydro bubble

54
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,040
dome yesterday and I thought I'm kind of thirsty and I thought that's crazy Andrew you're you're

55
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:35,040
underneath the water. Do you ever think things like that? No says the man in Washington. I don't.

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,720
Oh man. Well this has been my brother my brother and me. Tune in next week. Tune in next week when

57
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,680
we I don't know do probably pretty much that again just with different voices and hope you

58
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,960
don't notice. No this is an advice show and we're going to turn some questions into wisdom right

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:04,080
now. Here it comes. Oh here it goes. I have a slight problem. I talk way too much. Not because

60
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,760
you guys hear how good my voice sounds this morning? Yeah really good. Let me try again.

61
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,960
I have a slight problem. I talk way too much. Not because I'm insecure or socially awkward.

62
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,160
I just hate the idea of silence in a conversation. I've noticed recently that it makes me seem

63
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,840
stupid as a young college student who considers herself intelligent. I have a lot of interesting

64
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,560
things to say but they come out sounding ridiculous when they are said after a long long rant. What are

65
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,560
some ways I can make my gift of gab more meaningful and intelligent? That's from loquacious in the

66
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:50,080
lone star state. I personally. Justin loves a good long awkward silence. I love to dip in there. He

67
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
just likes to soak in it like a hot tub. He's one of those people that whenever there's even a brief

68
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,680
silence in a conversation he will address it and say like oh it's you know that it's a good

69
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,760
friendship when you can just sit there and be silent and it still feels just so so good.

70
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:14,320
I said it was 1368 sir please pull up to the next window. I think that the way you can

71
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,560
transmute your gift of gab into something that'll make you a hit with other people

72
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,400
is instead of. I know you're joking when you talk about having a lot of interesting things to say

73
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:37,840
and I'm sure you do but if you can turn that gift of gab into asking questions you know wanting to

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,840
fill the conversation up with asking people about themselves or you know filling any spare silence

75
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,400
with a question about the other person an invitation for them to talk about themselves

76
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,520
you will you will be more well liked and people will want to spend more time with you. I was

77
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,080
thinking yesterday about an old bit by Mitch Hedberg, Dear Department Hedberg and he said I

78
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,480
don't have attention deficit disorder but I took Ritalin and I found that I just had an extra long

79
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,760
attention span. I would tell people there's got to be more to that story and if you can be that

80
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,480
kind of listener if you can use your use your gift of gab that way then people are always that is the

81
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,760
ideal person to have in a conversation and like I know that I have dealt with this too like I

82
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,800
tend to talk no I know and the important thing to keep in mind is that while you have many

83
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,040
interesting things to say so do the people that you are oh do they for sure they really though

84
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,480
well I mean if they've just finished a long long rant and pause for a brief second and you go

85
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
oh there's marsupials and they have pouches and they're like mammals but then you know maybe

86
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,800
just let them finish their idea and then be like man that was great and you said that it was

87
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,320
actually your cousin the whole time and like make it about their story make it about what they've

88
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:14,000
said the secret to human relations is that no one cares about what you are saying yep with very rare

89
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,200
examples no one wants everyone's just waiting for their chance to treat you to the thing that

90
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
happened to them because unless someone's delivering instructions like and even then

91
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,000
even then it's like hit or miss back in the day like okay back before radio and tv you had to rely

92
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,920
on humans for your entertainment you would say like you've got to hit come on you raconteur

93
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,920
hit me up with a story to entertain me like now anytime that someone's talking is a time that you

94
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,360
are not watching the x factor so like you don't need humans to entertain you anymore you need

95
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,320
them to give you relevant pertinent important information and you'll also see this is one of

96
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
my favorite phenomenon like you'll hit a word in your story and watch the person you're talking to

97
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,520
something click in their mind that reminds them of a story they know and then it's literally like

98
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,880
you're watching a fuse yeah count down until they stop listening to the thing that you're saying as

99
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,960
they just fucking cock it in the chamber like wait for their chance wait for the tactical precision

100
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:24,640
strike to enter like oh oh oh yeah yeah speaking of your dead brother uh did you have you seen

101
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,840
the curious green the the green man benny green man what's the what's the picture by these plants

102
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,840
timothy button timothy button you can always tell the uh the the when a person is doing this because

103
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,280
when you see your when your story starts to divert from the point they were going to tie to it you

104
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,560
can see them in physical anguish it's like you're it's like you're going around highway curves too

105
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,520
fast what were you saying about tiny cars you said something about tiny cars hey do you remember 25

106
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,960
minutes ago when you were talking about that other thing have you seen that new benjamin green man

107
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
benjamin green man

108
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:14,240
so if you can if you can start use your gift to the gift really is asking questions is a lot harder

109
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
than talking i've i've found this as i've tried to ask more questions because a lot of times

110
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,160
questions can open you up to some pretty awkward interactions uh sometimes the answers are not

111
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,080
something you want to get back um but so so use your use your your speaking talents to try to

112
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,560
figure out uh questions to ask other people also another thing to keep in mind when it comes to

113
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,720
the conversations is there is not like a you don't have this like basket full of topics and

114
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,880
you need to get your entire basket empty before the end of the conversation it's not super market

115
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,440
sleep and reverse and so like you may have a bunch of things to say but if you have to pass by

116
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
you know some topics of conversation it's gonna be all right the only reason i actually like talking

117
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,240
to travis is because i'm always hoping he's gonna slip a dope metaphor in the combo like super market

118
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:11,520
sleep and reverse super market sleep and reverse yeah are you guys on yahoo yes yep this yahoo is

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
dressing him up as a dragon but i think the wings would be too complicated and i have four weeks

122
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,840
until the show he's a brown oldenburg gelding with four black legs oh and i'm a girl thank you

123
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,560
smiley face emoticon where are you going that you need a horse costume uh it sounds like some sort

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:48,240
of some sort of uh horse-based costume contest so like like like toddlers and tiaras for horses

125
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,560
yeah right here's the thing you could make a dope centaur costume but you would have to cut off a

126
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,480
significant portion of the horse and and i would i would call it a very important portion of the

127
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,920
horse which is to say it's pretty much its head and everything all that part thinking portion yeah

128
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,920
the think meat that makes his leg meat run well they still have their tiny uh uh forebrain yeah

129
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:23,920
sure aft brain i don't know hey hey guys what's up yes check this out okay foals and something

130
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,440
that's like a crown that starts with f i don't know what you mean i'm trying to do like foals

133
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,320

134
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:59,920
be as a camel you can be a shitty camel you can be a shitty one hump camel you just put a uh tan

135
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,440
blanket over you and then you're gonna want to secure that you're gonna want to secure that with

136
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,360
some um some pipe tape and then just uh just be a shitty camel i think the obvious answer here is

137
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,920
you dress him up like a person and dress yourself up like a horse a horse right and then you put

138
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,960
him on your shoulders oh and you can't wait wait wait wait wait hold on wait wait wait slower

139
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,760
continue and then you're the horse and he's the person continue but slower what part of slower

140
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,200
do you guys want to try to sort of get travis when he clearly to throw in some detail yeah

141
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,040

nature's greatest wonder my brother my brother means your source for references to obscure

153
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,680
90s comedy the stoopids be there keep it locked in the name of the lloyd we gotta go on in the

name of lloyd oh you could dress your your horse up like stanley stupid okay yeah from the hit

155
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,720
uh 90s comedy you're gonna it's as hard as it is to find a halloween costume that you as a human

156
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,840
being can wear and then have people notice the clever reference that you've made imagine doing

157
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:12,320
that for a horse that horse has to be some sort of horse right now let me throw this out you know

158
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,600
how they have those things uh like the costumes for dogs that just spit over their front two legs

159
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,440
and then they have like arms yeah those are fun business suits and those are fun yeah i like those

160
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,360
why don't we get like that like horse size so it fits over the horse's head and the horse's

161
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,160
front two legs and then it's got like arms and it's like a horse businessman or like horse yoda

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,120
man i just thought about running into that at a party and it gave me the shippers like a like a

163
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,320
bipedal standing up person but with the horse's gigantic head do you guys ever think about how

164
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,760
big horse's heads are and then just get scared apropos of nothing you could there i don't see why

165
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,360
um i don't see why the the horse can't be dressed like something that people dress like i remember

166
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,520
one time a costume that i thought was pretty good was i saw a guy dressed as judge lance edo

167
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,320
from so you want to dress a horse like judge lance edo from the jay simpson trial i thought

168
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,520
that was a pretty good costume so you could just dress the horse like what's something people dress

169
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,200
up like now probably dog the bounty hunter uh-huh oh my god horse the dog the bounty hunter don't

170
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,040
mind if i do what do you dress as a hunter and you dressed your horse is like a wall mounted like

171
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,360
head on a like a like you had to put something around his neck so it looked like his head was

172
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,920
mounted on a wall that's that's not macabre yeah yeah and you put the rest of them in a wall but

173
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,280
then it's like pretty good put them in a box just stand still horse i don't know i think that i i

174
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,080
think that that would be a pretty good make it somehow like a plaque out of cardboard and then

175
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,120
just put what about a zebra i mean i feel like zebras right there you know that's like a minstrel

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:32,160
basically here here's the flow chart did it have tom arnold in it if yes macaroons yeah was tom

193
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,240
thing okay so let me i need to take a moment then ask you something griffin you people ask us a lot

194
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,600
they seem to notice that you guys end up talking about horses and ghosts a lot yeah and it's like

195
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,480
yeah that's true and i think man i wonder how it happens and it just dawned on me that like

196
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,680
you are the one who's continually introducing horses into the conversation we don't get any

197
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,680
like listener submitted questions yeah like hey my brother my brother me horses if the three of us

198
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:29,040
were sitting in a room travis and i would be talking about like life and sure love and growing

199
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,760
and every few minutes griffin would like lean in and say yeah and like horses right let me uh let

200
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,920
me hit you with this what uh do you remember the first time we talked about horses uh and i found

201
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,560
that yahoo or someone found it but either way i claimed credit for it it was like i had i had

202
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:56,640
staked my mining pick into the ground and just uh just a torrent of i guess horse blood shot into

203
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:06,240
the sky shot into the sky and then i was like yahoo i'm rich i'm saying we have found red gold

204
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,880
we have found a deep deep pocket of natural comedy gases and i am ashamed when it runs out

205
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,880
we have to start fracking for horse questions yeah yeah honey might honey does this ice taste

206
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:30,160
like horse blood to you this is strange anyway that's why also there of all the people in the

207
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,560
world speaking out against horse blood fracking of all the people groups there are in the world

208
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:44,640
to make fun of i feel like horse owner and horse enthusiasts um equestrianistas are uh the funniest

209
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:54,000
and also it's the safest because none of them are listening to the show correct okay you can love

210
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,760
your horse just don't just not as much as your kids and it's not as much as your kids or your

211
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,120
family or your dreams it's important i know it's it's tempting because when you ride a horse it's

212
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,000
like it lends you its wings i gotta go back and remember some of those bumper stickers

213
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,560
has everybody on this podcast ridden a horse i have yes what was what did you like it uh i rode

214
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,920
bear back because i was on a farm i was on it for about uh i'm gonna say nine and a half seconds

215
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,120
before it bucked me off and i thought it broke both of my balls broke them in half

216
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,840
it's the worst pain i've ever experienced down down there

217
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:43,440
uh i when when i rode a horse it was at a place called bob's happy trails horse farm or something

218
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,880
like that definitely was that the shawnee state park happy trails horse farm yes something like

219
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,560
that yeah and shawnee state park did they call it happy trails horse farm because it's where the

220
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,640
horses go so that kids can ride them before they are killed before they actually you actually ride

221
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,920
them to the glue factory and drop them off and walk they say happy trails tiger i guess that's

222
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:13,280
the name for a horse it i i'm sorry is ben's maybe it's under new management though because it's been

223
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,720
a long time since i was there it's been 20 years but ben's happy trails horse camp i see but yeah

224
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
the only time i ever rode a horse i just remember feeling it's really it's really it's a really

225
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,560
the only time i ever rode a horse i just remember feeling it's rippling muscles and warm skin

226
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,680
betwixt my thighs and then i stared deep into its classy eyeball and i grabbed this chinkle

227
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,400
chinkle uh-huh and started praying to oh don't stop slower slower for me please the horse in my

228
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:54,880
thought a little funny it was tender it was tender no don't back off of it now you might be listening

229
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:04,880
um was it jtrh nbr or what was the deal just was it was it jtrj nbr or you guys know it was

230
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,240
um we actually i don't think we talked about jtrh nbr on the show no you got to listen to

231
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,560
the set dish if you want that yeah that nug if you want it that nug that choice

232
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,640
justin tell us about your happy trail experience i wrote it i got a boner i don't i want to oh my

233
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,360
god it's you can't be blamed for that because you're riding on just a mass of rippling muscles

234
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,480
it's like it is simultaneously like riding a bunch of vaginas and also like a gun

235
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:41,920
it's like riding a living cannon yeah yeah made out of vaginas that's what it's like a vagina cannon

236
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,280
a vagina cannon justin tell me where the where the horse's pubes trimmed in like a tasteful

237
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:54,080
line going to its penis why can't we just ride horses why do we have to fuck we don't have to

238
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,320
i'm saying we don't have to we get you because god gave us domain over all the animals i'm still

239
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,880
trying to figure out the title it seems like an abuse of our privilege then i'm still trying to

240
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,160
figure out the name of the farm a happy trail is it but is like a wish thing happy trails horseman

241
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:18,080
camp it's called happy trails because the horses are about to die and the trails are pretty happy

242
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,000
i just want to say as funny as it seems like to make fun of a person who loves to have sex with

243
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,200
horses there is it's america there's and it's earth and it's this reality there is somebody

244
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:43,600
who falls into the cross in the venn diagram sliver who is of our show's listeners and people

245
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,880
who like to have sex with horses and is not amused i would hope that that person has a good sense

246
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:58,880
i don't know the line must be drawn here there is no i'll apologize to furries about my ill-advised

247
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,480
ill-informed rants about furries i will apologize to jugglers or should i say juggler about the

248
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:12,560
shit that we said about jugglers i am not gonna i am not gonna go so far as to apologize equestrophiles

249
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:20,000
nope we we do not stand by our previous calls for violence against the furry community no

250
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that was a that was an ill-advised joke we love furries now a demo for jugglers and i totally

251
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,720
support people who want to have sex with jugglers yeah if you want to have sex with a juggler go

252
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,840

253
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,840
against having such horses you know this might be a little uh little controversial but i just do

254
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,920
not support horse fucking all right well well wait wait wait wait wait it's okay between horses

255
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,720
let's that's how that's if if we were if there was no more horse fucking there wouldn't be more

256
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,920
horses and that's at the end of the day that's what you have to keep in mind but yeah man man

257
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,240
or woman i guess woman is all right if a horse wants to bury his powerful horse shaft into

258
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:13,200
another horse's quivering waiting horse vagina yep i think that is i mean give me a sell tickets

00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,200
cool about accents yeah chill out i guarantee i bet i i've never traveled outside of this country

282
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,000
because it's the greatest country on earth um but me i bet that you don't go to like england

283
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,800
and someone goes oh my god what is that an american accent well no because your president

284
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,640
and stuff our accent is the grossest but i also bet that no one over there like you don't roll up

285
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,760
and someone's like oh what is that an irish accent weird no because they're they get that shit all

286
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,440
the time because they're writing up next to it they get that's what i'm saying could we maybe

287
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,160
just pretend like it's not the first foreign person you've ever met i think plus they they

288
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,640
see it on tv and stuff a lot uh because all their tv shows are i think our accent to people

289
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,560
on not on this continent or this continental mass i think i think it just sounds like every

290
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,240
time we're talking like whenever we're talking it just sounds like pizza's just fallen out of our

291
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:42,800
mouths i think it's a muddy i think it's a muddy sloppy sloppy diet dialect i don't think anybody

292
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,760
likes listening to it maybe when these people are like demanding that you say stuff in your irish

293
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,280
accent then you respond to them with what you imagine an american accent to sound like yeah

294
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,600
and be like okay and that's my impression of you how do you feel we all best friends to like a

295
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,000
british person we basically sound like the cockroach alien and human skin from the first

296
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:12,320
men in black movie a lot of times when we have conversations like this in uh our international

297
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,720
listeners take it as a cue to write in and kind of fill in some of the gaps uh in our in our

298
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,840
international knowledge i just want to make it clear on this point specifically i i don't really

299
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,280
care what you think our accents i like so please don't the only thing that i i really want you to

300
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:41,040
do is take the sugar like that okay i remember you know what i can remember being um a young boy uh

301
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,240
griffin won't remember this i don't think travis will either but i have a very clear memory i don't

302
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,360
have a very clear memory of the first time i discovered i had an accent because i was like

303
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,000
10 years old and i was at the beach um it was i think it was like an all-inclusive resort or

304
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,160
something where people there were like a lot of activities planned for the kids so the kids would

305
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,120
would do things separate from the parents and let the parents i don't know what parents do either

306
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:15,600
by themselves watch tv or something uh so uh we were leaving for the day for the week and uh some

307
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,720
of the kids i'd hung out with uh said oh we're gonna miss you justin we're uh we love your

308
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,920
accent and i and it was literally like it was like the end it was like the end of usual sustrans

309
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,760
like it's like guys are so say like wait a minute i do i have an accent i have an accent like for

310
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,880
christmas like two or three years ago dad gave us like all of our home videos converted to dvd oh

311
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,680
yeah and i sat down with teresa to like watch and was like honey come watch you know here's all my

312
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,400
memories as a child and i had i had always known that like we had an accent but not until that

313
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,600
moment was it thrown into so harsh reality as the video of justin and i playing on the jungle gym

314
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,160
oh yeah and it's like hi father you motherfuckers you motherfuckers turned the word daddy into a

315
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:15,680
four-syllable word you sounded like old prospectors thing if we weren't like three and six you would

316
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,240
assume that we were doing like the worst comedy routine ever there are a lot of bad that if you

317
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,520
watch this in malcolm gladwell's book the outliers he talks about how you need 10 000 hours of

318
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,360
experience to become an expert in something uh i like to think now my brother my brother me is a

319
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,800
show made by comedy experts but if you watch these because we've done hold on because we have done

320
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,320
10 000 episodes go on no believe no but we've been trying to do bits for our whole lives if

321
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,000
you watch these bit if you watch these tapes you could see a lot of half-formed comedy ideas and

322
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,720
all of my jokes now make about as much sense as they did then there is an idea there is a uh there

323
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,200
is a tape and then watching them now i just like i i oh it's hard to watch because i can see the

324
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,360
setup and then the execution just falls flat i said there's one tape where travis is i'm gonna

325
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:23,440
put him at four and travis says knock knock knock this one yeah knock knock dad says who's there

326
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:32,560
here travis says knife yep that's his knife who and travis says would you rather work nightly or

327
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,120
knifely yep what does it mean we'll never know what does that might as well be said in hieroglyphs

328
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,640
but see if you had fucking done that if you had done that on a stage and just taken your bombing

329
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,040
as hard as you would have it would have been like andy kaufman-esque like brilliant so you're saying

330
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,200
four-year-old travis was just a comedic genius yeah we all griffin used to have griffin had a

331
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,200
great bit when he was four or five the cheese no no i don't remember the cheese bit every time

332
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,920
there was a camera pointed at griffin i would say cheese he would just go cheese and it didn't

333
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,240
matter if it was a video camera or a regular if i was at a funeral or a pinhole camera i used to

334
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,480
look at eclipses don't care uh no griffin had a pretty good bit where he used to come up to you

335
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:28,160
say is there a baker under your bed and you would say no and then griff would say have you checked

336
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,360
they would say no then griff would say then how do you know there is not a baker under your bed

337
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,080
and you know some people was adorable and hilarious for me it was terrifying and i often

338
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,080
lived in fear to fear because they were in bunk beds and griffin would hang his head down at four

339
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,520
o'clock in the morning and shout this into travis's face i uh i have a confession that i need to get

340
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:57,920
off my chest after okay probably 22 years okay oh wow i stole the baker under your bed joke from the

341
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:07,200
movie rocket man i stole probably my most minute joke that whenever you talk about how funny a kid

342
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,960
i was i stole that shit from harlen williams took it right from him are you telling me this

343
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,640
yes i hate you took it right from you hate your fuck are you serious 10 years old you thought oh

344
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,320
my god this kid's on another level nope you know who is on another level is harlen williams

345
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
he while he's on another level for a 10 year old that's great because when i was seven i

346
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,240
used to think that griffin was like a young harlen williams

347
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:45,760
mm-hmm holy shit griffin yeah now i'm being usual suspects again now i know kaiser sozay too

348
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,360
sozay again um i didn't uh sozay we all so say we all you have suspects those

349
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:02,800

353
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,520
letter you haven't seen um and i want to tell you about ross has seen every movie twice tucker fancies

354
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,440
himself a pop culture expert but has not seen anything not jaws not pulp fiction not scarface

355
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,280
or even roadhouse it's time for tucker to see the films that everyone else has seen they watch the

356
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,640
films discuss its pop culture significance and occasionally bust into freestyle rap

357
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:10,400
to observe it only occasionally racist kidding and always entertaining if you want pretentious

358
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,400
dinks who spend hours discussing the artistry of one shot this is not for you well so wait you

359
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,720

361
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,960
i waited i i went deep deep into the rocket man minds and i came out with all of the comedy

362
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,680
or that existed in it and i'm gonna be honest it was not it was not much it required a light there

363
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,080
was a lot of cruft i uh i just i think it's really i think it's really indicative of the

364
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,360
box office success of rocket man that griffin has been cribbing this bit yeah and it never occurred

365
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,280
to anyone i actually talked about that extensively on icoe and every time i've ever told anyone about

366
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,480
griffin i've mentioned the papers on your bed and not one person in all of these united states has

367
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,680
ever gone well you mean you mean the rocket man actually uh jessica lundy put me on blast once

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,720
if you have a recommendation for a manlier dessert we presume as members of the volume

421
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,280
loving american nation that you'll have a better idea than us sissy brits that's from effeteater

422
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:10,560
in southeast london well you've come to the right place i'm fat might i suggest each of

423
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,520
you eat your own cheesecake that's what no see that like that hoes into sex in the city territory

424
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,480
for me everybody having their own individual cheesecake just for women that's what most of

425
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,400
the series was about everybody just eat a pint of haagen-dazs yeah exactly that's that's the vibe

426
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,760
of that why don't you four just jerk each other off what a sweet sweet dessert that'll be

427
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:46,960
i don't understand that i think the obvious answer is deep fried things is that too is that too well

428
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,800
i think well the obvious answer is to not assign goddamn genders to the dessert that you're eating

429
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:01,840
you madman like why is this bothering you so much griffin because it's it's i think it's sexist to

430
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:09,280
say this sweet light treat is a woman thing and these these hearty barbecue ribs are for dudes

431
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,040
only bros only with these ribs now griffin that's that's wonderful that's beautiful and you're very

432
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,360
open but have you never just like had a dude's night like yeah i i will have a night where i

433
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,600
primarily hang out with my dude friends but we're not gonna eat like a key lime pie and be like oh

434
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:36,800
what are we doing i man this is tough because i think that whether or not you i mean you can you

435
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,040
can do this without assigning gender roles to it i mean you can just say that you're having sort of

436
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,120
a a hearty a hearty night i will say that i don't think a lemon ring probably goes with barbecue

437
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,600
yeah that's crazy if you want to talk about flavor pairings you're yeah that's not i don't

438
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,120
think i i think if you're saying like this is a themed like outdoor cookery you know

439
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,480
old school kind of dinner then yes lemon meringue probably does not fit the the theme god you know

440
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,680
what i know that this is kind of a weird question but now i'm sitting here trying to think about it

441
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,800
like a like you have all your guy friends over it's just boys night out you know and you're

442
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:22,000
making some ribs and drinking some whiskey and i'm trying to envision a dessert you pull out that

443
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,480
it's not like what are you doing well that's the thing that's why back in the day then bradberry

444
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,040
and bob and i would have like a cookout day the dessert is more meat like you just eat meat you

445
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,040
fall asleep on the couch there is no there is no like way to transition that conversation of yes

446
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,480
good steak i like to eat it i've got something sweet i need something sweet on my teeth here's

447
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,440
my suggestion because whenever i do a cookout party this is what i go with get some bananas

448
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,560
all right slice them open without peeling them stuff some uh chocolate chips in there and wrap

449
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,840
them back up in foil pop them on the grill for about 10 minutes is this a real thing you do pop

450
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,920
it open either yeah it's delicious that's really good it is amazing and it's like grilled bananas

451
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,560
you know stuffed with chocolate and it's badass because you're like eating it in foil and it's

452
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:17,920
like fair food simple as shit still still shaped like a cock yeah i mean there is that i mean you

453
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,680
can do the same thing with apples too corn apple soak it in like brandy and syrup whittle it whittle

454
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,600
it into a cock shape and then put your dick in and put your dick inside the wrap it up in foil

455
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:38,240
pop it on the pop it on the the grill for a while i wish there was a way of and maybe i don't know

456
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,200
what the what you would call this aesthetic but i wish there was a way of separating what you

457
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:52,240
would traditionally apply as the you know call the the dude you know pastiche the the steak

458
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,120
the whiskey the jason statham movies what have you i wish there was a way of separating that from

459
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:08,560
um just dudes yeah like like i understand this is an aesthetic and i think that women should be

460
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:14,000
absolutely able to enjoy it too i just wish it didn't have like you're saying gender roles

461
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,760
attached to it right like called like an evening of badassery yeah i i don't know you like you

462
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,640
even like i don't know uh badass seems kind of presumptuous for eating steak and watching

463
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,680
kevin spacey movies like just seems like i don't know hold on hold on hold the fucking phone

464
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:38,800
yeah did you just give kevin spacey a carte blanche badass status i know i said it i said no

465
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:46,000
travis did i'm saying it's kind of self-important for watching for what badass this describing

466
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,280
yourself watching a kevin spacey well don't fuck what about don't fuck with spacey

467
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,480
he he could fucking wreck you did you see him in american beauty he was getting jacked

468
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,400
what if what if you called it just like an evening of male bondage okay now okay hold on uh

469
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,440
we'll come back to that the first time i heard k-packs i assumed it was somebody's frat nickname

470
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,440
from college a guy named kevin paxton and everybody called him k-packs k-packs

471
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:26,080
k-packs hey man i hope griffin had said that one very well i love justin's self-editorializing

472
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,360
it's just a note if hopefully we'll hear that written in red ink cut this i cut this that's

473
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:38,080
totally funny travis uh male you've you've actually explicitly put the word male

474
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,880
into the thing that i'm trying to execute like an evening of person bondage okay no what okay

475
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,120
evening of bondage because like you're bonding together but you want to say bonding yeah it's

476
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,280
not about it's not even about the bonding like i don't know i don't get down on the sense of

477
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,280
fraternity so much as just a sense of like eating food that is bad for you even it's bad for you

478
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:07,680
like eating some steak and having a martini and watching k-packs a good question but why can't

479
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,080
you just say like we're having an evening we're doing stuff we're getting together it's important

480
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,680
to let people know what they're coming like what they're coming into yeah you want to you want to

481
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,160
establish the the the vibe what would you call it justin i don't know i'm saying i don't have a good

482
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,880
answer i think we got to use a totally gender neutral word for like it has to be gender neutral

483
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:36,240
like nachos and steak then what if we just called that like dump and it's like a very it's a we're

484
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,640
taking a dump no no it doesn't have to be that it's just a word that sounds like the thing that

485
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:51,760
it is it's dump night come on over for dumb and then if sunday sunday sunday um dump

486
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,040
don't worry your fancy khakis we're taking a dump

487
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,320
i'm gonna take that word back from the way that you did honestly the juvenile way that you guys

488
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:12,640
are using it i just i'm gonna open a fancy chicago restaurant called dump does it have like three no

489
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:23,360
it has one one you with an umlaut jump i just come on down to jump we got steak we got steer

490
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:34,960
we got stick a job kpx um oh the walls are just lined with plasma screen showing the my the

491
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:43,120
choices we got all the freshest angus sticks and all the choices cuts from kpx a job

492
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:54,080
oh i just wanted a word to describe manly that is it doesn't exclude people with vaginas that's

493
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:00,080
what i'm saying i don't think that that's asking so much just what about jump but to be fair i mean

494
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,560
to be fair this is not just dudes are not the only guys who do this because every so often the

495

515
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,560

like at the breaking point he would he would crumble and he would not you ain't no twitter
