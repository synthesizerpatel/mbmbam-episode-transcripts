1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Griffin has something he would like to talk about in the intro Justin. I don't know if it'll be funny or not

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's just like all I all I

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,160
The only thing I can think about the only thing I want to do is listen to Carly Rae Jepsen's new album

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay, and I don't think it's gonna be like really funny

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,960
In fact, I think it'll probably be like kind of weird. Like I think it'll be off-putting for people

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,700
To hear me talk about this album

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,960
Okay. Well, I mean if you think it'll be a good bit I don't that's what I'm saying

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,040
I don't think it'll be a good bit

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,300
It's just like I want to bring I want to bring a realness to this episode and for me like

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,220
It doesn't get any realer. I gotta start now. I thought we started but we have to say our names and shit first

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,400
No, we don't have to do we it's 266. We can't switch out convention now. All right, let her rip

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,260
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,380
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:27,380
What's up, you cool baby. It's familiar, but not too familiar. But not too not familiar. It's a new craze. And good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna. Just say hey I wanna.

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,700

So what album is everybody listening to you right now good for you go first

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,340
Uh, okay, but I want to be the only thing that we talk about

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,980
I don't want to hear I don't want to hear about your two albums. I was gonna say fallout boy. Is that okay? Oh, is that true?

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,820
Listen, they a lot of people have been giving me a lot of shit. Have you ever actually listen?

26
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,860
Yeah, they're really good really good American Beauty American Psycho is an amazing album

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,460
Add me to the pile my dude and what we're at Griffin just to clarify. What were you going to say? I

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,160
I don't want to come at I don't want to come at the discussion like this. Can we start over?

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,300
I need you guys to be like you're not gonna

30
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,940
You know, I just want to say we are too huge to alienate anybody my brother my brother and me from this point forward

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,060
Loves everybody especially power players in the entertainment industry

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,340
I love we're looking for connections and networking wherever it is if we could get fallout boy on the show

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,500
That'll be a huge get I love the people fallout boy

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,100
You can love the you can love the sinner but hate the sin, you know what I mean?

35
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,900
I've been listening to Carly Rae Jepsen's emotion. I think that has pronounced because there's like a little dot

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,900
between the

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,340
Between the is it a mathematical formula like e equals m to the o of shun

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,020
Uh-huh, and that's that how the the chorus of her hit single goes e to the m equals ocean

39
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,300
It's probably the worst song on the album. And in fact, I wish that they hadn't titled the album motion

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,780
I wish only seven seconds long. Yeah, it's kind of meandering and she doesn't even sing and she's got a beautiful voice

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,340
That's the song that activates all the sleep the Canadian sleeper agents

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,940
Oh, yeah, it's kind of like a like a rap CD where it's like an improv track right like kind of a comedy track

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,140
Yeah

44
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,820
She does a she does a bit there and Jamie Foxx shows up and does the bit also and then the two there are a few

45
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,980
bits that her and Jamie Foxx do throughout the album and

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,460
They're really they're really good. There's not a bad goof on the album. There's not a bad improv track on the album

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,940
Again, I get again. I can't stress this enough not gonna be funny my me talking about this album

48
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,060
It's it's just but you thought was very important to you. Nobody's talking about nobody out of your system

49
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,300
Have you heard the album either of you? Nobody knows nobody's listening to this album

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,460
It's a it's a I I feel like I'm just like running through the streets screaming her name and and it's falling on deaf ears

51
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,700
No, I'm so busy talking about the Republican primaries. You know what I mean? No one's talking about Carly Rae Jepsen's album

52
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,260
Let's talk about the real stuff. Well, okay, but if you're gonna pull pull that card

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,900
we saw with the Republican primaries anybody everybody's talking about Donald Trump and I'm trying I'm

54
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,900
Carly Rae Jepsen is the opposite of Donald Trump in every conceivable way. She is a pure being of light. I

55
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
Remember it was the summer of

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,180
20-something and

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,620
Travis told us guys. This is the new shit. Yeah, this is the new heat and I did not believe him and

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,820
Then literally two weeks later call me maybe was the only song I could hear on the right

59
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,860
It was the only song available for download on iTunes. They cleared the table on every other song

60
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,300
It was the only song on the radio and it was everywhere

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,100
I tend to have a pretty good finger on the pulse of what's gonna be the summer jam

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Yeah, call me maybe and it was blurred lines and it was uptown funk. Yeah, and these are the summer jams people

63
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,460
Blurred is there one this is Sidney was trying to figure out if there was a summer jam this year

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,420
It was uptown funk. It was uptown funk. It's all over like Jane. What are you fucking talking?

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,020
No, it was a slow build, but it was the summer jam

66
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,220
The summer jam this year was don't get won't get fooled again by the who and it was a really super slow build

67
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,500
But it really took off this uptown funk the one was like don't believe me just watch. Yeah

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Yeah, like the one that's which is way more fun to say, please don't look at my crotch if it's way better

69
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,740
It's only

70
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,480
They all he only wrote that song to license it to network promos

71
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,660
like the only reason that song is this is cuz like so ABC and

72
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,580
NBC and CBS will be like lining up all the shows you must watch

73
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,260
Yeah

74
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,560
Yeah, no, you don't have to change it. Like it's literally just like we got a great summer of hits for you

75
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,700
NCIS is back. We've got perfect strangers to don't believe me. Just watch. It's a sequel to perfect strangers

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh, yeah, I you know what? I don't believe you and I will watch of course

77
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,020
Guys, I just want to get in my guest bathroom

78
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,060
Which is the only room in my house without a window

79
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,860
Just turn the lights off and just sit in absolute darkness and put my headphones on and just let Jepsen carry me away

80
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,740
Cut some lilies let him float on the bathtub waters little lavender. No, I don't even want

81
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,540
I don't want my sense of smell distracting me from my sense of hearing. I just I just want to hear the music

82
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,080
You just want to get a sensory deprivation chamber and float in Jepsen. Yes

83
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,020
Whist away. I want to go on a Carly Rae voyage into myself

84
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,380
Myself

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,380
This is an advice show

86
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Basically you want I will say though full disclosure

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,060
Griffin did warn us that talking about Carly Rae Jepsen's new album would not be funny. He said that before we started

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,460
Yeah, well and that was on the podcast. Yeah, you guys don't know this but I included that. Oh, okay good

89
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,500
What's your favorite for the music? That would be a twist. What's your favorite song on the album? I'll tell him funk

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,380
on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album emotion emotion

91
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,180
I

92
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,100
Like that justice remix what?

93
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,300
Where they remixed that one song with justice

94
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,440
And I think Dizzy Rascal did the original and then it was on Carly Rae Jepsen's

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,240
You know Dizzy Rascal rented out a track of Carly Rae Jepsen's new album

96
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,400
He's did you know Dizzy Rascal is subletting a track number seven on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album just to get out to the people

97
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,780
She wasn't gonna use it. No, she wasn't gonna use see she said I was just gonna put another Jamie Foxx

98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,060
It Jamie Foxx had this bit where he was gonna be a very old Jesus named Jesus sort of like geezer

99
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,640
Yeah, and she didn't really think it was that funny. So she let Dizzy Rascal sublet the track

100
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah track seven, of course is making the most of the night and that one's a club banger

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,220
Like that would be a good that would actually I could see Dizzy doing some really dope shit with that

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,780
Should we get on to the questions? I feel like I would give anything. Yeah, I would pay any any price

103
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,980
Do you have that power? Yeah, I can do it. I just do it

104
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,020
I have a friend that's been recently drive me off the wall

105
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,380
He for someone that's another album that Carly Rae Jepsen's new album is better than it's better than Michael Jackson's off the wall

106
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,180
Absolutely for some unknown reason has all of a sudden started using the word mate

107
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,740
when clear when addressing someone when he speaks

108
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,780
As if he came back from a life-changing year-long expedition in the wilds of Australia. It has adopted the language. He clearly isn't

109
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,980
Australian

110
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
He's clearly Canadian

111
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,380
Have to hear him. Call me mate one more time. This friendship is going down under

112
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,820
I felt like Casey Kasem and now another one go. Oh, that's because

113
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,840
It's because you're talking exactly like Casey Kasem for some reason. That would do it every time

114
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,140
Maybe it's from the group of guys he games with online. Maybe they're all Australian and he's trying to fit in

115
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,820
How can I make him realize the error of his ways brothers? That's a frustrated frecklekin in

116
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,820
Yeah, fuck way for quiet. I believe for quiet. I

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Don't think it's fuck way

118
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Probably not fuck way

119
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,340
Um hi, I'm Gordon. I'm Gordon fuck way, and this is the Alfre do

120
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,060
It's a very sexual sexual Alfre it stands for alien. I'd like to fuck I am

121
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,660
My name is Dalf what is that? What does he mean? I'm a mouth

122
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,940
It's not TV. It's HBO. Yeah, and it's raw

123
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
So this is the worst

124
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
possible

125
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,340
Yeah

126
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,100
There's no excuse. There's no excuse for this

127
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,660
It's it's probably the worst affect and there are a lot of really bad affectations

128
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,960
You just start doing for some reason this one's the this one's the worst

129
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,760
Maybe you know it's your friend of some sort of researcher trying to find the worst possible

130
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,540
Affectation because he found it and what makes it double worse is that there's no bay

131
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,180
Like at least if he had come back from like a two-week vacation in Australia

132
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,160
Then you're like oh, you're trying it, but with no basis for it. It's just this like amorphous blob

133
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,940
Mysterious worst have you guys ever had an affectation that was really hard to shake that you're embarrassed to admit

134
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,600
Definitely definitely right. I mean I still do it when I went to

135
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,060
the UK for my honeymoon I came back saying cheers a lot like

136
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,100
Cheers like like just as a standard greeting or goodbye or whatever to say cheers a lot

137
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,260
One time is out at a Japanese restaurant with some friends. I said come pie when my drinks came and

138
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,260
I fucking vomited

139
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,940
Just checked out vomited just knowing that in the future. I would look back on that moment. It's such a deep deep

140
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,140
cosmic shame

141
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Bloody snuck its way into my vocab

142
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
I

143
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,380
Did I'm not proud of a minute, but it did it's not in there

144
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,260
I'm not saying like we should be clear here. I'm not judging. We're not judging like

145
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,980
the actual

146
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,420
Affect like the actual like slang and accents of another nation that that is fine

147
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,380
Yeah, you everybody has their thing. It's the the appropriation of it. Yeah

148
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,500
It can go opting. Yeah, can you do it for so long though that you?

149
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,680
Own it like if this person says mate for so long eventually you'll forget this the the impetus right the first thing

150
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,380
Like if I just start answering the phone every time anybody calls me like mushy mushy

151
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,580
And but I do that for like six years. Do you think I'll stop you?

152
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,540
Well, you'll become the guy who's known for doing it because he's terrible

153
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,100
um, but then but then it's still I think it would retroactively shape you in a way that you couldn't recover from like I think you

154
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
could stick in your car, but like a

155
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:20,660
Grain of sand in an oyster shell you eventually would form a pearl of being terrible around it. Mm-hmm

156
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
around the irritant I

157
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Think that when your friend does this you need to shake an empty pop can full of pennies at him. No. Hey, no

158
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
No

159
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,180
Can or have you said anything is it like does he know

160
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,260
Like oh, he knows we've noticed and we hate it

161
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,700
He knows Justin earlier said that the word bloody snuck into his his vocab. It didn't sneak into shit

162
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,980
It's it wasn't it didn't it didn't put a cardboard box over itself and then like worm its way into your brain

163
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,900
You sat there thinking like okay, here it comes. God. I hope this works. Yeah, bloody well, right, huh?

164
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,700
And everybody look at you do it and you do it the first time then it's like, oh

165
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
Felt kind of good. Hey, nobody said anything

166
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,900
It's not because nobody said anything because they were like terrified

167
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,620
It was the word they love you so much and they're terrified that this is just gonna be you now. Yeah

168
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,380
That's just gonna be the person they know. I

169
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,060
Don't know how you write this ship. I don't know if you call out once it's gonna be really hard for you

170
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,900
But he will never do it again, right if Sydney looked at you and said Justin you sound

171
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,300
Completely like a clown when you just said bloody just then you sound like an idiot clown child

172
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,260
Might I suggest?

173
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah a full-on like to catch a predator moment, right where you're at a party

174
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,660
And I know this is this isn't how it happens in to catch a predator

175
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,180
It would be really weird if it was but you're at a party

176
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,940
He says me you lay your hand on his shoulder and you say hey

177
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,900
Can I talk to you in the kitchen and you take him in and go I just want to break down what just happened there

178
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,860
You did this thing. Everybody thought you sounded dumb

179
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,140
Do you really want to walk back into that room right now and say it again?

180
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,060
Just think about that before you come back in I'll be in the living room. Yeah, please don't like yeah

181
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,260
You're basically grounding him. Yeah from conversation like hey. Hey fly boy. I'm taking away your license

182
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,640
You're on you're on probation. I want you to really think about what you did before you re-enter humanity

183
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,080
Can you adopt an even more obscure Australian affectation?

184
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,560
Let me throw this out crikey. Well, it's not really even more obscure

185
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,280
I was thinking no one's that maybe a shrimp on the barbie. No, I was thinking it's a little thing

186
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,800
I was thinking like that's a noise but like completely out of like completely out of

187
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Well, that's a lot

188
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,600
He didn't see someone with a knife and just identify it as a knife. He's a knife. Oh

189
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,100
Nice in it, but I hold that right there. There's a hand in it. Oh, it's a bloody. No

190
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,400
No, I'm cool. You've solved the crime

191
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,420
What's the murder weapon listen noise, yeah, there were stab wounds that seems really likely good work inside in CIS Dundee I

192
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,380
Don't think they'd call it in CIS Dundee. They'd probably call it in CIS Australia. Do you guys know yahoo?

193
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,340
Sure. Yeah

194
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,260
This yahoo was sent in by level 9000 yahoo drew drew drew Davenport. Thank you drew. It's by yahoo answers user. They're anonymous

195
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
We'll call them mock a dial then D

196
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,220
They asked in the category society and culture etiquette. I

197
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,340
Want to join a local biker gang, but I don't care about bikes

198
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,620
Should I be up front about this or would it be wiser to pretend?

199
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
So walk me through

200
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,400
There's two sentences. How did you get lost? No, no, no how that first interaction went. Hello fellows

201
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,280
I like your lifestyle. Hello. I do not care about these metal things. Hi there my two my two-wheeled compatriots

202
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,180
Hail and well met you have a place for a Subaru

203
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,980
I can take all the bags and the cooler and stuff

204
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,260
That is true when they have beach day. You are going to be quite prized

205
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,620
They can't those folding chairs and on the back of them motorbikes

206
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,780
They're gonna be so stoked about your Honda fit and all its roomy

207
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,840
Backseat, I can't wait. I just ordered some new handlebars for my Harvey Danielson

208
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,480
It's a Harvey Danielson good bike and it's from their 2010 good bike model

209
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Which is an antique at this point and I have new handlebars coming for it

210
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
And they pop off like the handlebars and Pee-wee's big adventure. So if any of you

211
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,360
Road dogs tries to yank my grip off and make me get a road rash

212
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,840
Then the handlebar will come right off in your hand and I will cruise off in my Harvey Danielson

213
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Unscathed no road rash here. How long?

214
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,400
Unscathed no road rash here. How long?

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,640
Could you keep the grift going like well my I have again guys my

216
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:08,060
Motorcycle that I own room Queen. She's in the shop again. Gosh, man

217
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,360
I just really go got arrested. I don't know what I can tell you guys

218
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,440
I get room Queen out of hock and you know, cuz I sold her for

219
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,920
Biker drugs and now I am without wheels. Let me say once more. I am NOT a cop

220
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,240
I want to tell everybody I appreciate your ride your offer of a ride to

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,400
The motor meetings and I just want to tell you it's not that I'm afraid of motorcycles very very very much

222
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,560
But it's just that

223
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
hemorrhoids, you know

224
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,600
hemorrhoids I

225
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,320
Have to point out they're not afraid of motorcycles. They just don't give a shit. Ah

226
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,720
These guys in their bikes. I love it's it's I love the people and I love the community. I I love like

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,720
What do biker gangs do I loved watching Sons of Anarchy like that's what it is. It's just that it's like

228
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,880
I watched Sons of Anarchy. I want to do crime. I want to hate other races

229
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,600
I don't want to invest in a motorcycle. I want to lean over pool tables a lot

230
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,480
I feel like that happens in biker gang like they go to places where there was a pool table

231
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,280
They lean over and then glare at the people that walk in. Yeah, like that's the thing that happened. Yeah. Yeah

232
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,140
Maybe community service. I don't know

233
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,460
There are biker gangs that I'm sure are like this is more of like an affiliation of like like-minded people who also just ride

234
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,100
Motorcycles, but mostly we're all about like cleaning up the streets and building parks for kids who cares?

235
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,440
There's a core idea. That is we ride motor

236
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,360
Also finds us and it's bikes

237
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,440
Yeah, that's the one thing that you can't we kind of like have to get on the same page with that is shitty

238
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,200
though if you think about it that like if you did just

239
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Maybe you just love motorcycles, but like you can't afford one. Like you just can't you have a kid

240
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,480
You have one car that your car seat fits into and that's it

241
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,940
Yeah, like you just can't afford a motorcycle. You just love the lifestyle

242
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,340
It's rabbit. You can still be in that gang. I think so, too

243
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,180
But only in that only in that like I'm saving up or do you guys have like a spare I can use

244
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,580
Until I can afford my own because here's what you want

245
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,980
This is what you do Justin you go down to the local local junkyard

246
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,900
You buy like an old old beat-up like whole no one would ever want to ride that motorcycle again

247
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,220
But then you put love into it

248
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,820
I'll fix it and you buy stuff like a second hand and you're fixing up and is it the prettiest motorcycle?

249
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,380
No, no, it's not. In fact people at the the rich kids motorcycle gang

250
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,460
They make fun of you, but those guys down the street that are maybe past their prime. They welcome you

251
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,420
Yeah, they do and then at the big motorcycle race

252
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh boy, your motorcycle wins because it's filled with love and magic and nitro

253
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,020
So this is a script then that you've just written for listen

254
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,020
If somebody would like to pay me for this property, what's it called the property?

255
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,660
real quick motor motor motor motor motor bike good friends

256
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,260
Okay, I say that's a great title for it

257
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,820
I would just sit outside with a sidecar and just sit out there with my stupid goggles and my helmet and when they came

258
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,780
Out to go do crime or community service or just go to Wendy's I would just be like well who's got room

259
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,020
Who wants the kid today? I'd be like a mascot. You know, I like that

260
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,180
What would you and what would you I hate to keep putting you guys on the spot

261
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,580
But what would your mascot name be because I feel like that's important to the biker game dead weight

262
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,140
Almost certainly. Yeah, that's I mean almost certainly dead. I tell you how I'm getting good with a biker gang is

263
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,940
Other than the fact that I can probably do like more smack than anyone in one go

264
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,580
I've never done that, but I feel like I'd be really good at it

265
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,380
That's how you won president of the student body in high school. That's true. Somebody hand me a big bag of smack

266
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,820
It was like I bet you can't do all this like watch me go crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch

267
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,620
I think that's how you do it. I think you

268
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,060
Slurp slurp slurp slurp slurp how I get into the biker gang is I would I would have a bike that I fixed up like

269
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,620
Travis said basically the plot of motorbike good friends

270
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,460
But where I would twist it is instead of filling it with love I fill with gadgets

271
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,180
Wouldn't that be cool if like I did have like the the handlebars that popped off and I could like shoot out an oil slick

272
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
and I could

273
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,980
Drop some cow trips. You're talking about motorbike good friends after the studio notes

274
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,560
Yeah, where they're like in the bike anymore of a like a chitty chitty bang now

275
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,920
Can the bike talk so we can cast Peter Dinklage as you know what Griffin is that kind of shit that ruined motorbike good friends one?

276
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,580
I don't want to see it in motorbike good friends, too

277
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
It's more kind of a back to the can I say that?

278
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,420
Motorbike good friends 2 sounds like an origin story. Are you rebooting it that quick? It's a prequel. It's a

279
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,140
Guy on a bike and it's like don't ask any questions

280
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,020
Yeah, yeah, and everybody's like where did he get this motorcycle?

281
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,900
I wish there's another movie explain this I have a foolproof plan for infiltrating the biker gang and

282
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,960
Endearing myself to them. It is multi-tiered. It is very complex. It is one word. I'm gonna hit you with it now

283
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
You ready? Yes tequila

284
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,340
Like the song I just do this funny dance on a counter and then everybody be like I'm into it

285
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,860
I like what he points at his wiener and then also his butt

286
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,220
He's in the gang and I like his white shoes now. Hold on. Don't think that peewee's actual move. Yeah

287
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,980
I don't think that's why they enjoyed his dance. So like I feel like it was just like a fun moment in a kid's movie

288
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,640
I don't think he was like my dick my dick my butt but but but my dick

289
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
again, I said my

290
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,580
butt but

291
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,980
Watch that scene again

292
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,220
And then travel back in time to the late 80s and see me

293
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,020
emulating that scene at home and tell me I'm not pointing at my dick and then my butt because that's what I thought it was

294
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,020
and I until I mean, I thought that for a long time until

295
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,980
1.30

296
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,920
Today just now I thought he was playing. Are you sure he's not pointing at his dick and then his butt?

297
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm like 99% sure it's not he's not doing a dick to like I was I was like like pointing as privates

298
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,140
And that's what made it so like that would be a weird thing to do in front of a big group of bikers who?

299
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,460
Moments ago. We're going to kill. Yeah, I would love so he got up on a bar and said look

300
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,540
I think dick and my butt a lot

301
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:31,620
What if in the reboot of peewee's big adventure that the biker gang at the at the bar was ms13 and

302
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,940
They were like, is he pointing at his dick? Oh, man, that's great

303
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,540
But then they cut off his head and throw it in the river what I'm saying to you right now is I'm looking at the movie

304
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,740
He's pointing at his dick in his butt. You're watching the scene right now. That's what he does

305
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,860
I'm seeing his dick in his butt like he's indicating like here's my penis. Here's my butt

306
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:56,100
It looks like an instructional video for what dick and but for where the dick and buddy is who would do what's the market for?

307
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
that video I

308
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Anatomy classes mainly

309
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,540
Very remedial and anatomy classes. All right, let me check out this video here. All right, let's know

310
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,500
I guess let's all watch the tequila dance from peewee's big adventure

311
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,540
I'll just send you guys a direct link set exactly the timecode and

312
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,940
You will you will see you will and you at home just search peewee tequila on you

313
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,300
It's just a silly dance. He puts on these weird shoes and does a silly dance on a park

314
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,180
He's pointing at his dick and then after that his butt that's what he's doing

315
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,740
Why would that disarm the gang? I didn't because he's making he's not at all Justin

316
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,140
He is definitely poor like dick dick, but but dick dick, but but that's what he's doing. If you

317
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,500
Meaning like he is he's using fists. There's no extended fingers. Those are his fists

318
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,180
This video is too low quality to see if their fingers or not. He is like in the general genital area

319
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,820
I agree with you, but he is in no way directly indicating. These are my genitals. He just he's oh wait

320
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,780
I'm watching it now. I'm watching it now and he's drawing actually slow concentric circles around his dick and he's mouthing the words

321
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,780
It's right here. It's right here. It's right here

322
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:12,180
Why why oh my god, I'm still watching it. He just pulled his pants down and he's spreading his gaping asshole

323
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
tequila

324
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,380
My read on the scene is that he's making himself out to be a tantalizing piece of boy flesh

325
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,460
Yeah, too perfect for them to ruin with simple violence for him destroying their motorcycles

326
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,860
Yeah, he's a he's a primo fuckboy and they're gonna wanna keep him around. That's what he's saying. That's what I'm saying

327
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,500
Oh my god. He actually just hold on. Hold on. Stop stop talking. Yeah, he just said I'm a primo fuckboy

328
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,620
How have I watched this movie hundreds of times? How have I not like I just like glossed over the scene, I guess

329
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
tequila tequila

330
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,060
They love it too. They love it

331
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,820
I love it. Well, he got out of another scrape. No

332
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:06,540
All life-threatening scrapes that Pee Wee Herman gets out of by exposing his dick and his gaping butthole to perfect strangers

333
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,100
Listen, I didn't write the scene now watched it and interpreted it. You know what?

334
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,100
I could I'll tell you this director Tim Burton me and

335
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,180
Paul Rubens may be author of that film they may have may have created that vision but I as an audience member my

336
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,860
Interpretation that scene is just as valid as layers. So if I say he is pointing his dick and then his butt that's how the art

337
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:35,260
Manifested itself to me. That's the Mandela effect. Yeah talk about Justin and eventually people in the future will be like

338
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,780
Oh, yeah, of course

339
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,780
He got his dick out in Pee Wee's big adventure and people would be like did yeah

340
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,140
I mean I remember that and then people watch the movie go, you know a fun fact. He never actually says

341
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm a pretty well fuck boy in the movie. He doesn't he doesn't I don't spread misinformation traps. He did just say that I

342
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,960
Just I literally just watched it

343
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,700
So I find it ironic that in the movie he gets out of trouble by showing his dick

344
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,620
But in real life he got into a lot of trouble by getting his dick out

345
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,660
Well, yeah, it's because he ran into some trouble and he was like, let me get my dick out

346
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,440
But that's not you're not in the fictional. This isn't this isn't cool world Pee Wee

347
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,560
You're in the real space who framed Roger Rabbit

348
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah, if you can't get out of a cartoon, you can't get out of a cartoon scrape by showing us your colon

349
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,340
It's not how it works out here in the physical realm

350
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,780
They're like, I can't believe we got tricked by that. We should still arrest him right? Like we got to cover this up. Yeah

351
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,600
He is a spitting a lot of people nut. He's getting a speeding ticket and got a stick out. He's like

352
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, and they're like, yep that you're free to go

353
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,740
tequila

354
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Let's go the money's on

355
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,740

363
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:31,020

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620

But they could because no one will ever do that Travis you and tell us about the other one

368
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I do. We also want to talk about base camp. We've mentioned base camp a couple times on the show

369
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,740
Basically how it works is you know in this digital age?

370
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,140
Everyone doesn't always work in the same office anymore

371
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,700
Sometimes you're spread throughout the world and it can get hard to

372
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,900
Get on the same page when it comes to completing projects with base camp base camp makes it easier to wrangle people with different roles

373
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,980
Responsibilities and objectives towards their common goal and then lets you finish that project together

374
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,900
Everybody gets on the same page Deborah over in Montana doesn't get to it like say like oh I didn't know if that's what

375
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:21,180
I was do God Deborah get it together. You fucking we have a cloud platform for this Deborah

381
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,460
And then like move on to joining a biker gang Deborah has just got her head in the clouds

382
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,600
She's not using the cloud properly

383
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,700
Do you guys think that's definitely definitely build it been a Dilbert cartoon about like somebody saying like use the cloud

384
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,840
I've got my head in the clouds, and then they spill coffee on their dick

385
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,200
I want to tell you guys about Zveni baby

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,920

393
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,260
It's Zveni baby music.com to download Zveni babies debut album painting pictures

So I said painting pictures, which I will reiterate include songs based on the dark towers

396
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,220
So I'm like really stoked. I'm totally gonna go listen that because cause like what?

397
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,500
Here's a song from it right now monster house. It's a monster house

398
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,600
Everyone look out for the monster house, and then here's another song. Oh, no. It's a crab monster

399
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,420
He's got poison his claws, and he's gonna come bite my fingers off

400
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,420
That got a little for you was that Stephen King. I thought it was Stephen King

401
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,940
He wrote this book, but now he's in the book. I didn't I haven't gotten that far

402
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,500
Happen I'm only on the fourth book you'll get there. You'll get a push listen everybody gets hung up a wizard

403
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
And that's cuz it's a shitty shitty

404
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,340
14,000 page book is actually it's actually a very great book. It's just a real

405
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,540
derailment of the nothing to do with the last

406
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:55,860
Have it really goes free prior around a train that's gonna explode unless we solve this mystery to hold up before we get back

407
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,340
To that though before we resolve that situation. Here's

408
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
950 pages about schoolboys

409
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,860
It is kind of a crazy thing to be like cliffhanger and before we get back to that

410
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,900
Let me just read you a quick book. Here's just one book if you could just read this book

411
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,980
I wrote it right back to my own book. Here's some fanfiction. I wrote about my own story. I got a message here

412
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
It's your glass rules though. It's just like

413
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,260
Here's a mess. Sometimes I think about the music the movies are making a dark tower and I make up a trailer to it in

414
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,620
My head when I'm bored

415
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:33,380
It's always set to a someone saved my life tonight by Elton John which Griffin you also probably don't understand why but like fully

416
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,080
Think about how good of a trailer that'd be I have a message here for Rosh and it's from Margo

417
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
To baller ass names Margo says to Rosh

418
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,400
I wanted to say or rather the brothers to say thank you for the best year of my life

419
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,160
I can't have imagined anything better. Thank you for the endless laughs including introducing me to this podcast and fun

420
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,340
You are the best friend and boyfriend anyone can ask for happy anniversary. Love Margo

421
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,600
That's lovely. That's lovely. You know, I love about that two things

422
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,400
I love love in any form all forms of love are wonderful and beautiful

423
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Mm-hmm. And

424
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,240
I also love that they're spreading their that that love is actually benefiting us actually putting money in my pocket

425
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
And that's the best kind of love that there is

426
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
I know I just said all love is equal

427
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,860
But the love that helps us bump that download count is probably better than the most beautiful perfect. Yeah

428
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,320
But anyway, happy love Rosh and Margo. We also have a message for my friend and yours Sean Foreman

429
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,940
Sean is

430
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:41,220
amazing, um, he's got a special notice from his best gal and darling treasure of a wife who is also lovely and

431
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,720
Melanie says to Sean happy 30th bidet to the handsomest most your suit husband a girl could ask for

432
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,640
May all your days be filled with frolicking silvy dogs your nights danker than danky Kang and your thoughts as deep as Chicago style pizza

433
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:02,180
The brothers and I raise our glasses of power to you good sir. Cheers your sweet sweet loving woman

434
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,980
Ah happy 30th Sean and here's a twist

435
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,780
Sean independently also reached out to me and would like to wish Melanie a happy anniversary

436
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:19,580
So I figure I just tie those two together. It's kind of a gift to the Magi scenario, but everybody gets something

437
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,460
Yeah, so they're not like the gift of the Magi at all the gift of the Magi to this time for sure

438
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,620
But that's just called presence

439
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,940
It's not a gift. It doesn't deserve. It's not it's not part of that parable

440
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,860
It's just I gave you a present in the second one

441
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,940
He gets her he buys her a hair dryer and she's like and she got him like an iPad and she's like, what are you doing?

442
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,260
Just give me something. You know, you fuck this up so bad the last night

443
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,940
Just give me something completely unrelated to the thing that I obviously know I am bald. You know, I'm bald

444
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,880
It's ridiculous mark. It's ridiculous

445
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,840
especially when I told you what I wanted I

446
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,680
Wanted a tennis bracelet a tennis tennis bracelet. I didn't chop off my hands to get you this iPad

447
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,160
Get me a fucking tennis. I don't have wrists anymore. It's just elbows straight to my hands

448
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Like some sort of turkey woman

449
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,360
Well, here we are quick press conference time

450
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,720
Fuck fuck every week on D live from the McElroy brothers studios where in we in beautiful Burbank

451
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,920
If it was live, then we would have had this shit dead to rights on tape, but then we lost you

452
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,240
Did you okay friends beloved friends? Did you yesterday feel a?

453
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:46,640
Disturbance in the comedy energy. Did you feel a great shuddering of bits of good of precious?

454
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,620
Finite goofs being lost to the ether

455
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:56,120
I picture it like a minority report when the three people in the pool like sense of murder coming

456
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,100
We're just suddenly everybody starts shaking and going the jokes are dying

457
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,640
Yeah, every every listener of a bim-bam a red ball appeared on their doorstep and when they picked it up and looked at it

458
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,620
It just said some dick jokes because they got killed and we lost them to that

459
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:18,180
Justin's recording of the second half of the podcast got this one. This was not on me for a change

460
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,700
This is definitely on audacity and Teresa asked me this morning. She's like, how does that happen?

461
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,100
Am I responsible as he will here's about the thing about computers. I don't know he literally it's it's inexplicit

462
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,940
If you're a data expert, he the end of the podcast was fine for him

463
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,580
The beginning the podcast was fine for him, which you just heard

464
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,380
You just heard the first half of our original recording and now here we are

465
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,980
Back again, cuz he lost like eight minutes in there somewhere and shit sucked

466
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Shit sucked everyone

467
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,300
Okay. Well, I guess let's do it again. One more again

468
00:36:52,860 --> 00:37:00,060
Same goofs again. Well, not the same goose different goose, but no I'm doing the same goose. I'm not writing more material

469
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,220
I write on my material that tell you guys that I didn't know that

470
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:10,140
What question did we do last time that got lost to the ether the note on the desk? See you bad one

471
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,380
Let me tell you all how it went last time. That wasn't gold. It was all of us got really indignantly angry at this one

472
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:23,540
It's angry. Yeah, so let's see how we react this time. Okay last time it was indignant anger and then this time who knows?

473
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,500
It could be joyous joyous laughter love and acceptance. Don't cry for that show that shows gone. I should never exist

474
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,900
This is the new that's an alternate timeline. Yeah, absolutely. Maybe your life would have been changed by that

475
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
I have no idea you have to deal with this

476
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,540
One of my co-workers just transferred to a different office. See you didn't say transferred last time

477
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,540
So it's already really super different

478
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,460
The day after he left I found a note on my desk from him saying how he was

479
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,500
Always too tongue-tied around me to say anything, but he thinks that I'm beautiful and wish you could have gotten to know me better

480
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,460
I'm not interested in him romantically, but I do think he's a nice guy and appreciate the guts

481
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,460
It took to even leave the note read

482
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,300
None, I want to thank him. That's my editorial ization

483
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:13,540
I want to thank him for the compliment, but it will it sound at all sincere when it's followed by but I'm just not interested

484
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,020
Yeah, would it be better if I said nothing at all? That's from secretly admired in st. Louis good news

485
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
I'm still angry. Yeah

486
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,680
It sucks me too. If anything, I'm more angry for I have not had my breakfast

487
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
it's just like

488
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,260
It's let's get let's cut to the quick. Let's not beat it. There was a lot of bush beating last time

489
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,060
We talked about it for an hour and a half yesterday

490
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:43,140
I wrote about that in my diary at night my post-show diary felt like there was a lot of bush beating

491
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,380
Hope recording gets eaten by Jesus

492
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,000
Well here you'd like another shot

493
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,480
The fed it's this shouldn't be on you. This sucks. It's like it's it is the

494
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
It's such a weird way to go about

495
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,920
This like it's that you say that it took guts to leave the note and maybe that's true to a small amount

496
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,500
But it would have taken it took significantly less guts

497
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,140
They're just like walking up to you and talking to you in the first place

498
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,920
And if this was like a Jim Pam situation where you guys were like fast friends and you actually talked and hung out and stuff

499
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,960
That would be cool, but this is just like a weird mash note from somebody who like

500
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,200
Like literally didn't give you the time of day until it was time for him to bounce then he's like hey by the way

501
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,320
I always thought you're a pretty boy, and then a ripcord pulled him out the window

502
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:40,040
What you have to do your responsibility in this situation he's nothing yeah because like you know all you this is this is as far

503
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,600
As you need to go unfold note read. Oh, that's nice garbage garbage

504
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,400
a little giant blunt because if

505
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,340
Basically what this person has tried to do whether they realize it or not is say I'm gonna put the onus on you to make

506
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,660
Contact cuz I'm a chicken shit. That's absolutely true. This is where like

507
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,780
Infinity romantic comedies have ruined people's perception of how the shit works because this guy is expecting you'll read the note and be like really

508
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Devin you

509
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:17,040
Same Devin yeah, she'll like jump out like run through the rain to like the other office across town like please don't do this

510
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
I've always loved you too from afar

511
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,640
But now you just chase him through the rain and be like thank you, but I am NOT interested in you romantically

512
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,280
Want that dick here is an umbrella. I am NOT interested in that dick, but do take this umbrella

513
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
We've got to keep that dick dry here

514
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,720
That's the way this works in the real world how it should work is you look across the office you see

515
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,460
Susan like first time and you're like oh, she's cute, and you walk over and you say hey

516
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm Devin is this your first day of the office. Yeah, it's great

517
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,920
Do you want to like grab a drink after work, and I can tell you all about how things don't do that

518
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,640
No, don't do that off the jump. Maybe not first day, but like if you like her ask her out your co-workers

519
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
So that might be a leave

520
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,960
Oh, God, we didn't even see it's good. We should take a second pass at every question because we don't get to that erudite

521
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:12,120
Nug until our second go-around what if it's like illegal? What if the HR rep is like that's what makes it?

522
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,340
Sexy I'm fair. That's what makes it sexy right? I do think that that would have been noted in the question

523
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,760
Hey, I've been the case. Hey, did y'all just kiss no Thomas. We didn't you guys stink like kissing

524
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
I

525
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,800
Smell kiss juice all over you. There's kiss juice all right. Hey listen

526
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,640
Mother slappers. I just went in the bathroom. It's some reeks of kisses in there. Yeah, I will say something did occur to me

527
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,480
Yes

528
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,280
Upon this second attempt that did not occur to yesterday. She says

529
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,960
You know what I shouldn't gender her. I don't I don't know a

530
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,280
man woman where this question asker says

531
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I

532
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Think that he's a nice guy, and I appreciate that although he does say beautiful

533
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,840
Which we cut it would be kind of an eyes a beautiful David Bowie's a beautiful man fair enough. Yeah

534
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,820
I do think he's a nice guy to appreciate the guts it took to leave the note, but I'm not interested in romantically

535
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,640
We yesterday chastised the note-leaver

536
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,560
But it sounds like they kind of nailed it like it sounds like they did have a correct read on these

537
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,920
Situation as it stands like I do need to get this off my chest

538
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,320
And I do recognize that this is not a thing that is happening

539
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,480
So I'm doing this due diligence right just get this out into the universe because like my read on the situation

540
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,240
Which it as it turns out is 100% of the money is that you do not desire a further relationship with me

541
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Oh, so he's a precog

542
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm saying there's a lot of pre-cognitive shit going, but no Justin

543
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,760
It's a self-fulfilling love just be so much easier matters of the heart be so much easier

544
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,320
There were little red and brown balls telling you

545
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,200
But the problem is is this is a self-fulfilling precog because basically what he did was he made himself like

546
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,480
She wants a dude or they want everybody

547
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,040
Everybody wants someone who's willing to like put at least enough skin in the game for me fight for me

548
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Devin say words out loud

549
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,640
Say what don't be a paper warrior fucking say words out loud to make things happen because those are the kinds of people that

550
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,000
Go you know what sure you risked a little bit. I'm willing to see how this goes

551
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,200
You gotta risk it for the biscuit exactly you don't get that biscuit for being a paper warrior

552
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,360
He's trying to get a biscuit risk-free, and that's good. It's gonna be

553
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,840
It's gonna be too

554
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,220
Hard it's gonna be a two-day old biscuits can be crunchy and unpleasant. This is what you do

555
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,400
This is the time you use that note you run a note that says look up and they look up and you're standing there

556
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,200
And you say hey, that's okay a little creepy, but at least like if that's your intro

557
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,000
That's your plan go for it, but this like I'm a ghost

558
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,680
I left the office and now only now in my will do you find out I like you like here's the way to go

559
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,600
Here's the reason that you should not respond to this because if you respond to it and say hey listen um

560
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,960
I think you're a nice guy

561
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,600
This is a really brave gesture, but I'm just not that interested then this guy

562
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,560
What this guy like will learn from this is like I was a good approach wasn't the right person

563
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
But maybe next time when I transfer offices

564
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,480
There'll be somebody here where that seed will find purchase and he'll post on the message boards

565
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,160
And be like it almost worked this time fellas next listen colleagues. No risk required

566
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,800
It's a biscuit. It's a biscuit parade out there. How go nuts just reach out your hands and run run through the streets

567
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Grab as many biscuits as you can take

568
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,400
It's just insane. I'm just irritated because this is this is a person who is

569
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,800
Generating their own missed connection. They're like this isn't a missed connection. You were there every day

570
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,040
Yeah, like they were there every day just

571
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,440
Just risk it yeah, and then

572
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,520
perhaps

573
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,600
People people don't people think that they just because they risk it they're guaranteed a biscuit. That's inaccurate no no no no

574
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,520
It's not a biscuit

575
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,960
What there's no guaranteed biscuit right? That's right. It's a you you all non riskers

576
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,800
Don't get biscuits, but y'all not all riskers get biscuits, and that's

577
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,480
Just how the biscuit does how a cookie crumbles a biscuit and harbor is safe and a biscuit on the water gets soggy

578
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,400
But sometimes you want to soggy, but I lost the thread

579
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,560
It looks so to see water that would be fucking disgusting

580
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,880
We're not saying that this is easy like it's obviously not easy like if I wasn't

581
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,040
Happily married right now, and I had to be in this game again

582
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,800
I would be this might be me like and and back back in my 20. Oh, it was me

583
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,480
I was this dude. I was note guy and like I made you I burned you a CD

584
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,320
Oh, what's that in the liners? It's a confession of my love. I'm gone though

585
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,040
So hopefully we'll run into each other tomorrow, and you could tell me you liked it

586
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:04,240
Bye like Travis James hole-in-the-wall this has nothing to do with like any sort of like

587
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,920
Alpha male friend zone garbage like we're not like it's not it's not that like I'm just the nice guy in the corner

588
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,840
She does her like I'm not talking about that like that. That's that's a whole other weird

589
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,320
Subset of this question what I'm talking about is just having basic human

590
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,880
Communication skills, and I know it's intimidating and like right now

591
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,720
There's probably some of you on the phone like hey, this is really insensitive to those of us who can't do

592
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:35,840
Do you can't today you can tomorrow maybe and that's you know that horse ride risk that biscuit a lot of that like nice guy

593
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,200
Friendship move friend zone bullshit comes from stuff like this

594
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,240
We're like if you're not and I'm sorry to like put you know put baby in a corner and call people out

595
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,120
But like if you're not willing to risk it for the biscuit like how do you expect them to be like okay?

596
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,160
Well, I guess I'm willing to do the work and reach out to you now like what?

597
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,900
What do you think you're putting forth in a letter that says I was too scared to talk to you?

598
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,200
But we should totally date now like that

599
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,280
That's not a good look. What is the future that relationship look like okay, madam? That sounds like a fine order and sir

600
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,560
What will you have oh, you're you're standing up from the table. You're leaving a note. You're walking away

601
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,760
From the table. I'm sorry. He does this every time he wants a chain barbach on you

602
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,160
You don't have to read the stupid note. That's what I'm saying like it is people will respect

603
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,320
Even if they don't want to go out on a date with you even if they're not interested in you

604
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,240
they'll at least respect that in this day and age of texting and like

605
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,520
Messaging and fucking note leavers that if you're like hey, this is me a human being standing in front of you

606
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,520
I would like to ask you on a date. No okay great. Thanks so much. Talk to you later. Bye

607
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:49,040
I don't even have a problem with the note if it's like if you're still at the office if you're like literally like I get

608
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,880
Really tongue-tied whenever I try to talk to you

609
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,820
And I just wanted to try to say to you like hey

610
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,440
I'd like to go out sometime and maybe get to know you get a bit more comfortable

611
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,740
I'm fine with even that own your shit like if your shit is that you can't let you you do get tongue-tied these situations

612
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:09,560
Like own it own it. Just don't like leave a note and then parachute out. It's insane

613
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:16,240
Nothing will come of that. Hey, you make something over that you were perpetuating this insane strategy to relationships

614
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,440
It worked for that lady in love actually

615
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,880
She left a note, and she's like if I can't say it at Christmas when I can I say it. I'm yours David

616
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,460
And now let me take you on a tour through your past long past your past even

617
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:39,100
My side of house rule is number one. I love you. I

618
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,900
Don't know why Griffin was doing Michael Caine is the British woman

619
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,500
That's the only so my British woman accent is just a higher an upscale of Michael Caine

620
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,860
Do you guys want a yahoo? Yes, please? I just want to put a button that real quick

621
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:57,800
We're not chastising anybody everybody's got their shit. God knows I have mine when it comes to like social situations

622
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,780
We're trying to inspire you don't don't live life. Oh, it's not it's not chastising

623
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,360
It's like it's it's the truth and what sucks is that if you if you do

624
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,000
Stuff like this where it's like I left a note, and they didn't answer

625
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,400
It's just gonna make it harder for you like you're just gonna be like a little this fucking nothing works

626
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,480
Nothing works because you try to think that can't work. You know what I mean, and what it is is it's this actualization

627
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,480
It's this like you're you tell yourself that it's a romantic gesture when really what it is is you?

628
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,280
Tried to find like the easiest low it like least scary thing

629
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,240
That's not a romantic gesture if like you waited until you weren't around

630
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,680
Left a note that they didn't have to respond to to your face

631
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,440
That's not a romantic gesture is I did something risky, and it didn't work or did work, and I got me that

632
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,240
Disky, that's a romantic gesture

633
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,240
So don't just just make sure you're not convincing yourself that you're doing something romantic when really you're just looking for an easy

634
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,480
Out and hoping they'll do all the work as long as we're playing buttons and things I do want to stress

635
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,600
That this whole time. I've not been referring to women as biscuits

636
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:13,880
No, that that much is clear right because I don't want people to think that I'm some sort of weird like misogynist that doesn't like

637
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,840
Get it like I'm a misogynist who's just like trying to get things going like hey guys. What if we called all women biscuits, right?

638
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:27,460
I know you're talking about more of like the ephemeral metaphorical eternal biscuit a desirable thing

639
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:33,800
Yes, which for which ironically enough for me is a biscuit. No. I would I could go for a biscuit right now

640
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,820
I crush a biscuit. I would ruin a biscuit right now. I would come and you got a yahoo. I would devastate a biscuit

641
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah, I would ruin a bit that biscuit wouldn't be able to look me in the eye afterwards

642
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,880
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Sperling. Thank you Rachel

643
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,360
It's by yahoo answers user Debbie who asks

644
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,880
Can I bring frozen pizzas in my carry-on or hold in hand?

645
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,360
wait

646
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,960
Is okay is this is this is the question is the question?

647
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,500
like can I bring frozen Pete like pizzas that are still frozen right or can I

648
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,000
Prepare a frozen pizza as a mid-flight snack and bring it upon the plane with me

649
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,040
Cuz this is not this form

650
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,540
But it is a question that I've often asked of like is it cool to bring this hamburger that I bought in the airport on

651
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,200
The plane with me like you bought in the airport. Yes

652
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:27,720
It's fair game

653
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,480
If you made the hamburger at home and then you brought it or worse yet

654
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,480
You bring with you a patty and some iceberg lettuce and some tomatoes individually in their own three three ounce bags

655
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,480
And then you assemble it on the plane and do a little bit of prep work there and do a little bit of BAM

656
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,960
Kick it up a notch there. Well, hold on spicy rub that you know, what if you take it to a full show, right?

657
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
And you're like Benihana

658
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,800
In it up over there is you're like flipping the tomato in the air and catching it on the burger and everyone around you like

659
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh, he's a real burger professional. Look at that burger boy

660
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,980
I'm gonna go ahead and say that they will not allow you to bring a Japanese griddle on the plane

661
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
That's a draft. Did you look I?

662
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,680
Can check the TSA guidelines

663
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,240
But I'm pretty sure Japanese griddles are like number one on their things cuz like you put that in the hands

664
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,960
Of a of a splinter agent and I don't want to I don't want to be down wolf

665
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,780
I don't want to be dour, but you put it put it in the hands of somebody with something to prove

666
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:33,480
You know you you we all know the regulations about liquor when you're going on a flight and we've learned to build our lives around

667
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,760
Those small bottles that we can carry with us on planes

668
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,840
but what we have what I don't think has been addressed fully by TSA guidelines when I'd be interested in testing is

669
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,440
Could you just bring a pizza like?

670
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,120
Obviously you're not buying a frozen pizza in the airport. That's insane. That doesn't happen

671
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,800
I've never even seen a freezer in an airport so like obviously you're not doing that

672
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:59,640
So this person is saying they're going to just have a they're gonna have their suitcase. They're gonna have their carry-on bag

673
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
they're going to have a

674
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,360
Tombstone just a fully frozen like ready-to-cook tombstone. Yeah, is that getting through the TSA?

675
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,200
Justin, are you talking about like just going and like grabbing a hot and ready and like going through security?

676
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,520
Yes, I can't see why they would stop you. They can't stop you right. This is a great

677
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,720
This is a great this brings up another great question and this question is really splintering off into a beautiful question tree

678
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,400
But if I take my proactive

679
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,520
Which is a three-step topical application that I use to fight my battle against bad skin every day of my life

680
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,440
But Griffin you have great skin. I know it's the proactive anymore on that same tip

681
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,080
If I freeze that shit, can I bring as much as I want?

682
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,160
If I if I freeze it in a giant ice cube, and then I bring it on

683
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,680
a sled

684
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,040
What if it's an extra saucy pizza and after it defrosts you?

685
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,300
You bring it out in the bathroom, and you squeeze out four ounces of marinara like good job. I guess

686
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,560
Really you really skirted our nation's security for sure, but then they would update it wouldn't they and then they'd be like no

687
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,600
Solids over three ounces like what it's too saucy

688
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,640
We've been very antagonistic towards this person, but is it possible they're going someplace

689
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,840
Where where pizzas outlawed maybe they're they're a pizza outlaw like the state of Tennessee like the state

690
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,060
Is outlawed and only outlaws have pizza only outlaws have pizza

691
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,840
They never talk about that, but that's fact if you outlaw pizza only outlaws will have pizza

692
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,880
That's a good point our war on pizza has been a colossal failure

693
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,840
Yeah, the streets now than there was in 1998 when we began

694
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:57,680
I don't even know what Tennessee's trying to achieve with that law if your pizza if you're bringing your pizza either on your carry-on

695
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,940
Or just literally holding it in your hand that is not good smuggling technique

696
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,280
No, but Griffin you're getting it all wrong

697
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,420
It's so it's it's so blatant that there's no way they'll suspect you like the TSA agents would be like well

698
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,680
He wouldn't he wouldn't just carry the pizza on the plate. He's got to have like shirts folded up in that box, right?

699
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,800
Like yeah, well yeah, I mean yes Travis except when you touch down in Chattanooga

700
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,760
You better believe the pizza police are gonna be on you like

701
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,080
Instantly you better be smuggling it in your tummy cuz that's a solid like three hour flight for me

702
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,840
Like I don't know that scanner that you go through where they put make you put your arms up like you're doing the YMCA

703
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,440
That will detect pizza in your tummy and listen all want to walk around Rock City munching on some pizza

704
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,120
We all want to do that, but you know what sometimes the law is the law and it's not okay to eat pizza in Tennessee

705
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,120
And I get that even though Rock City is the perfect place to consume pizza. We all know that

706
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,680
It's in the guidebooks from pre 1998 before pizza was outlawed

707
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,760
But unfortunately the the governor just won't allow you to have pizza in Tennessee

708
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,880
And that's fact look it up the most you know the most annoying part about the pizza band

709
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,120
Is that you could still totally get pizza when you're in when you're in?

710
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:17,120
Tennessee you just like you just have to know like the right places to go there are these doors you knock on them

711
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,920
And there's like a secret pizza club. They call them speak Cheezys

712
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:26,640
And you just go in and you and you can get that pizza like like prohibited pizza. No problem any topic

713
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,080
There's just like a guy like named Jimmy knuckles at the pizza bar

714
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,760
When you do that you know you're just contributing to like the organized

715
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,400
You know pizza families and like alco calzone, and you're just like giving money back to the evil right

716
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,640
That's why I see is going down the tubes

717
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,480
Calzone is how he got it in we just folded them over

718
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,560
Let me see that sandwich. It looks like you got cheese sauce and meat in there

719
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:59,120
No, it's a calzone office. We just unfold the calzones. They're all just going to get a calzone loophole

720
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:06,760
Oh, yeah, no don't take it to be so great I Kyle Canaan has a great bit on his album where he talks about like

721
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,200
Then he was flying next to this dude

722
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,760
He brought just like a plastic bag full of waffles and syrup just like loose waffles and syrup

723
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,280
And it's like eating them out of the bag

724
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,320
And that's what this sounds like to me like you're gonna take a frozen pizza

725
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,240
Which I think is pre-cooked allow it to thaw throughout the flight so like as you're like doing the descent

726
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,400
You're just munching on some soggy defrosted pizza. I

727
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,860
I once sat next to a woman who had a tub

728
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,200
This is this is I swear. This is true Rachel is with me

729
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:40,800
We were flying next to this woman who had a tub a country crock tub only there was not country crock inside the tub

730
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,920
It was some sort of crazy tuna salad and she was dipping some wheat thins into it

731
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
This was the flight before

732
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,040
Through security. Yeah, this was our flight before our flight to Japan

733
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,240
And I was like if I if it was the flight to Japan I would have called the air marshal

734
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,000
I would have literally ripped open the the emergency exit and kicked this woman out of the plane con air style

735
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:13,920
Because there's that's and that's like a 10-hour flight, and I'm not gonna have an intercontinental tuna fish adventure

736
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,080
You kick that tuna fish idiot out of the plane. You just look at everybody else and like no ticket

737
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:27,300
I love it and also like no ticket, but also she did have tuna fish salad and oh my god

738
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,760
sweet god it was like tuna fish and

739
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:36,840
Just a really fragrant because even if she eats every bit of it in the first hour. It's like it's a linger

740
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,080
It's a linger. Oh, yeah, it's in the play. It's a self-contained system

741
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,280
Yeah, there's just you're not getting additional off your recycling

742
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:50,240
Just air for nine hours while everybody watches Twilight new moon on the back of their seats. You're like that

743
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,120
It's like that one restaurant in the airport that only serves the stinkiest salads

744
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,320
And I don't know where it is, but some people do because they're bringing them on the plane

745
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:05,520
This is a this flight is going to be on an American Airlines stink bullet 727

746
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,080
It's a it captures and contains stink and we have installed special fans to really circulate it

747
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,360
so if any person on the plane is eating, I don't know some some sort of

748
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,040
Spiced wilted greens that smells gonna be just everywhere

749
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,480
It's gonna please enjoy norbit on a loop for the next eight hours

750
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,960
It's gonna smell kind of like some sort of airborne nursing home. It's gonna be really great

751

754
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,120

My hope is to have 30 days of me undies every day for a month. Do you do laundry once a month?

760
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,680
No, but that is my goal to be able to just rotate through you

761
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,320
Don't want to like have like two pairs that you're washing and wearing every two days. You'll wear them out

762
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,420
I want enough that I can rotate in a new cycle. I get it. I get it

763
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,000
Let's see. Let's let's burn. I we did all of this

764
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,320
Work bear with us. We have some yes fairly important stuff in the housekeeping, but we'll move

765
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,600
So we got the la pod fest in September September 18th through 20th. Is that right? That is correct. Okay, so we're doing that

766
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,960
We're gonna do a live in a bim-bam and the first ever live adventure zone

767
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,440

You can get a $25 pass to watch all of the shows that you want during la pod fest streaming live

771
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,780

And then you'll have a whole month to check everything out. We have live shows coming up later this week. Holy shit

777
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,280
In we're gonna be in the Pacific Northwest. We're gonna be in Portland Seattle and Vancouver Portland

778
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,120
Sold out. I'm sorry

779
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:47,520
We had a few tickets go up or last week and the venue didn't put them up when when we thought they were going to

780
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,960
And so there was a whole kerfuffle

781
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,520
We are we're really sorry if you tried to get tickets for that and couldn't because of the delay

782
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,440
Seattle and Vancouver there are still tickets available for you Portland. You just go up to Seattle. It's pretty close

783
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
We're making the drive also Portland

784
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,200
I don't want to encourage too many people to do this because there's no guarantee on this

785
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,020
But you could always try like standby and hope that like people bought tickets

786
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,220
But don't show up that happens from time to time

787
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,320
So you can come down to the venue night of and try to get on a standby list

788
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,840
But once again, yeah, there's no guarantee that no guarantee Seattle and Vancouver here is a guarantee though

789
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,060
Go to bit.ly forward slash in BNB am Seattle or bit.ly forward slash van in BNB

Am and you can get tickets for the shows and those shows are this coming Saturday for Seattle and Sunday

791
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,900

792
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
