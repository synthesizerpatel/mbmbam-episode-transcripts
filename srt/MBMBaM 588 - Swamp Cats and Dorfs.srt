1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,580
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother

9
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,680
And me and if I show for the modern era, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middles brother Travis

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,180
executing program a big dog a wolf wolf McElroy and

11
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,560
Hey, what's up? This is Griffin. Oh, oh, sorry guys. My butt cheeks servos just became desynchronized. Oh, no

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,820
It's that time of year though, isn't it? It is. Oh

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,880
Well, welcome to our podcast for cyber Monday

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,120
Sorry, I transformed my hand into a can opener which

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,160
Monday, I feel like I could have done. I should have spent more crads on my deck

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,800
Yeah, I'm regretting it also kind of sound like you weren't in control of the transformation like it kind of happened

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Yeah, you gotta get that looked at also. I thought you had a fucking thermoblade on there. Yeah

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,480
combo it's a

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,960
Thermoblade combo can opener so it opens cans with the thermoblade is what you're telling me

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
It's basically a thermoblade which I learned I can open cans with yeah

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry guys is just tough to get comfortable with my butt cheeks moving in opposite directions

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,240
Why did you do that? Well, cuz he wanted to be able to clap them. Yeah well without standing up

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,720
Yeah, so when I did my stand up you guys remember back in 30

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,180
31 and you know, nobody really liked it

25
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,320
But then I was like I could become the guy who could literally make his butt cheeks. Oh fuck. Sorry guys

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
This sucks. I gotta go get these tuned up

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,680
So this is our cyber Monday episode where we're talking about all the different ice that we're gonna be cracking through

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,680
And the the different decks that we're using. Hey Trev. Yeah

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Tell me about your deck. Oh

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,240
That's a very personal question Justin. No, don't come on don't get sloppy

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,280
I just want to know about your deck that you used to break through the ice Mike for cyber Monday Mike tank

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
And I used to break through the ice

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,840
Yes, I feel like this is a reference when you're chipping when you're chipping in. Yeah, okay

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Yeah, and you're gonna you're gonna do battle with the corpos. Uh-huh

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,000
Tell me about your deck you fucking nasty boy. Oh, I see this is about like a hacker thing

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,480
It's cyber Monday, baby. This is the day that we celebrate

37
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,840
All all of us deck heads get together and and celebrate just netrunner culture

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,320
Well, this is this is actually kind of embarrassing quiz. I'm actually one of the corpos

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
Shit I kind of bought into the whole big big business thing a while ago

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,760
And I've been I've been selling microchips a huge markup

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,320
We just started working on I probably shouldn't share this but we just started working on macro chips

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,680
Which are like microchips, but they're way bigger and they're more expensive to build

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,920
But they're a lot easier to work on because you can like see the things

44
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,040
So that's like that. That's just a big set. Hey if you're interested Griffin, I could get you a position here

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,200
At chippies Inc. This is big. Yeah, that's good Griffin get your corner office

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Do something I'm starting to think Travis maybe has never experienced the new wave or the next wave dream dream life or cyberpunk

47
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Any of the ways? Well, I do

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
I'd rather be zeroed that becomes some sort of nitpick Corpo. Yeah for sure

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
I got a new car and it flies which is pretty cool

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Do you guys have a flying car?

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,920
No, I traded in all my kibble cards for a few spare eddies so I could upgrade my my

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
Input. Well, they just gave me a 402 K

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,320
That sounds pretty good though, it is I would like some money to tune up my

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Wheelies and your but your wheelies, but they come out of my feet

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,240
My actual heels. They actually that's actually an included benefit

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,680
At should be bank is they just like give you they tune up your wheelies

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,280
That sounds good because they keep the wheelies guy when he installs them right into my heels. Yeah

58
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,800
He's like now remember Griffin. I don't want to have to keep telling you this

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,960
But you can't use these on the beach and I'm like, yeah, dude, whatever as I smoke my cool future cigarette

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Oh, you don't have I have the wheelies with like the extra wide tread so you can use them on the beach

61
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm about to skunk you Corpo

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
I

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm sorry. What what's that mean? Exactly? Is that good thing? It means it means Corpo pig

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,920
Fuck, you know, I got that but the but the sky are you gonna kill me?

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Why have you never done a futuristic adventure zone? We're so good at this

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,560
Well me and you are about to scuzz this Corpo. I'm sorry

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,480
But why do you assume that a hacker a criminal will be the hero in the story where I'm making microchips that people need

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,960
For business. Why am I the bad guy dude, dude, you used up all the fresh water and now we have to drink salt water

69
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,720
That's not true. I didn't not me

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm trying I'm making microchips and macro chips so that we can build new water processing unit

71
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm about to fucking skank this Corp pig fuck but like

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,800
Provides 90% of the macro chips for water processing so we can get our clean water back. Why are you hacking us?

73
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm gonna scuzz this money bag fuck. I don't think you guys are the good guys. I think I'm the good guy

74
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,640
Eat virus scuzz bag

75
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,560
We give back in a lot of ways we we provide a lot of funds to the local food banks

76
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:44,440
Yeah, right. We know we do making us all eat fucking algae for every meal everybody eats algae. It's all we've got

77
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah, and whose fault is that because you desalinated all the water, but that was 200 years ago. It's not my fault

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,820
I'm about to shrimp this fucking pork bag

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,600
Yeah, I'm all dwarfed out right now. Do it right now. Hey, hey, I feel like can I just say and I know that maybe

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,020
I'm a corporate but kind of feels like you guys are making up a lot of this slang as you go

81
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,400
No, this is all this is okay. Well, then just real quick. Hey, we grew up in this we're fucking we grew up in the street

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm your brother and I know that's not true. And I grew up in the Metro

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm gonna count down three two one go and I want you and Griffin to at the same time

84
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Tell me what Dorf means

85
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay, three two one go

86
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,160
Synthetic endorsement. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. No, I agree. No, I agree with you

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,480
I knew Justin was gonna say that because we're cyberlinked through the netwave. Yes

88
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,640
And this is embarrassing. I was like we did not want to tell you this because we knew that you would get jealous

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,320
But now that you're a scuzzy Corpo pig fuck, uh-huh

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,040
It's we can't let you in on like our attacks that we're gonna do on your ice. Well, that's actually okay

91
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, no, I get my eyes after us. Yeah, we don't want any console samurais trying to fucking scuzz us

92
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
How do you guys know about the samurais?

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,620
Because we're not fucking that pig Corpo Jerko dirt brain dead shrimp

94
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
idiots

95
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
idiots

96
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,880
My work is recently found an alligator in our parking lot

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
We named her Georgie

98
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
She's currently stuck in a clogged storm drain you have dealt with the situation

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,320
Poorly already, right? Like no

100
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,680
Nature has dealt with it. It doesn't sound like anybody put Georgie in the clog star drain. Nobody puts Georgie in the store

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,960
My boss who is not a native Floridian is

102
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,720
Determined to become the next Florida man by sticking his hands in the great to release the poor swamp cat

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Is that a thing so Florida man? It's like, you know, and it's a new story. It's like Florida man

104
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Eats, you know right case of Red Bull or whatever and then jump, you know

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,440
I don't know through a plate glass window to eat a donut, you know stuff like that and a swamp cat is

106
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,600
A gator, I guess I guess it's you can use context clues here. Yeah, let's go with that

107
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,120
Yeah, I doubt that there is a gator and a swamp cat in this story late other kitty. Yeah

108
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,880
Well that right there there's gator swamp cat they's always getting into scrapes

109
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,160
How do I respectfully tell him not to be a dumbass, especially since he's the only one Georgie hisses at

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
And that's from please don't pet or feed the swamp cats

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,740
So apparently this Florida thing is like is being osmosis. Is that the deal? Is it being?

112
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,980
It seeps in through the water or something that turns people into Florida man. Well, yes, obviously

113
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,740
but I would say at this point when a human being says I'm gonna reach in there and

114
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,540
grab that alligator I

115
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,980
Think that they have momentarily forfeited their right to respect

116
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,740
Yeah, and you can just say don't like I don't think you need to choose your words carefully at that point

117
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,620
I think that you can just say like hey, wait, wait, stop stop stop stop stop. That's dumb

118
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,280
I don't do that and I hate to play this card, but there is something

119
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,980
like

120
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,380
Extremely Darwinian about this or it's like if anybody ever has the thought that crosses their mind of yeah

121
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm gonna reach in that storm train that has a gator in it. I feel like they there's a lesson like

122
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,020
You may talk them out of this one. But the next time they're like, oh that blimp is crashing

123
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,360
Well, I'll just fly over there in a big kite and try and stop it and they will die

124
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,980
They will die in that accident instead

125
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,120
Like they need they need a little bit of encouragement to be to not do

126
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,500
Terrible ideas like this because there's there's like animal control, but I'm also betting in Florida like

127
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,020
private

128
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,940
Businesses that handle this exact kind of thing. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, and

129
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,980
I doubt that this is very much like a like well, listen, here's the secret anybody can do it

130
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,180
Yeah, why pay 90 bucks to gator getters when you can just get the gator yourself because oh here

131
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,720
Okay, ask your boss this let's say you reach in there and you get the gator

132
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,980
Then what?

133
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Yeah, they're just gonna go right back in there. They found a hot dog, but they've been there's only one

134
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,260
There's only one thing that happens next and that is you see your boss throw an alligator

135
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Yeah, I mean you're gonna see a man throw an alligator is what's gonna happen

136
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,020
That's the best-case scenario Justin you are assuming that they will be able to fetch this gator

137
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,580
No best-case scenario best-case scenario your boss fishes said gator out

138
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,260
They lock eyes a forever bond is made. I love that

139
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Yeah, the gator. Yeah, like he's up onto its shoulder. Yeah, right on his shoulder

140
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,300
I mean like a like Guapo in the new far cry now you got yourself a little gator companion

141
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,220
Oh who's hanging out with you about the branded content Griffin? I told him

142
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,940
Like they paid us to talk about them once a year and I just I wanted to knock it out here at the end

143
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,220
You know what? I mean? I wish Sarah Davis was here. She would she would know what to do. Yeah. Yeah, Sarah Davis

144
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,460
All right. Yeah, this is our social media manager. She's a native Floridian. I wonder what her her

145
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,700
Let me see if I can channel her don't

146
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,360
Yeah, this does this feel like one that

147
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,580
People who know more about Florida and alligators are going to be mad at us for like it has that vibe doesn't it?

148
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,900
Right where there's like a oh actually step-by-step every kid knows like this is what like we're taught this in second grade

149
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,780
if you see a gator in the drain like this is what you do and

150
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,840
And we're like whiffing it so hard. I

151
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,300
Remember one trip to Florida when we were younger and we were staying with our nanny

152
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,260
And she lived right next to this big golf course and just by like serendipity

153
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Earlier like in the trip

154
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
She was like yet

155
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,820
Don't fuck with gators because they can run up to 35 miles an hour on land and then like a few days later

156
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,660
It looks crazy. It looks so fucking wild and then

157
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,540
It looks like a snake that has suddenly sprung legs out of its body and I was like, I don't know how these work

158
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,360
But here let's do this. He's excited and he like

159
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,620
Dipped his snoot in some trucker speed earlier and he's trying to get away from his own new scary legs

160
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah, but then we were walking on a golf course later in the trip and saw a gator like by

161
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,260
You know a water hazard and we were like a decent distance from it and then I was like, oh, right

162
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,540
Those things can run

163
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,860
Three times faster than I can I am out of here. I turned walked away

164
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,460
Can you imagine if I had not received that warning from my nanny and I was like, let's see how close we can get

165
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,380
I wonder what it feels like or if you hadn't looked up from your Gameboy color at that very second to see the alligator

166
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
You know what? I mean? Yeah. Yeah

167
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:50,220
Do you ever think about it's weird if if Nani was like Griffin what piece of advice have I given you in your life?

168
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,060
That's stuck with you the best in your entire life. What has been the most useful. Yeah wisdom. I've shared with you

169
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,420
I mean, it was great when she taught me how to count cards

170
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,780
But I would be dead if it weren't for the alligator warning the big end

171
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,620
And plus counting cards has actually gotten you in a lot of trouble in Old Vegas. You know what I mean? Yeah, man

172
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,860
I mean

173
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,060
There are I mean a couple triad

174
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Communities that I am not welcome to anymore. Yeah, not even the quadrats want him at this point quadras don't want it

175
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:29,460
Um, but yeah, I mean I did rack up several million dollars Nani one time when she wasn't prepared for our arrival one morning

176
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,140
Taught us about our tummies don't know what time it is, which is when she gave us hot dogs for breakfast

177
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,340
Yeah, I didn't even know you could have hot dogs for breakfast. Yeah, she opened her eyes to a lot of like dope shit

178
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,540
I remember one time she took us on a weird

179
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,460
Like kind of day trip around the area and a part of that involves going to like Bob Evans farm Evans farm

180
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,380
It was great. But another part was just going to look at some dams and locks with like that was awesome. No execution plan though

181
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
So it's just like here's a dam in a lock

182
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
You wanted to see an execution

183
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,980
Very dramatic setting for you. All right

184
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,140
Sarah says the hottest take is to let them learn the hard way

185
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,540
Thank you. If someone is determined to play with a gator then they go with God

186
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,140
But there are better ways to become the Florida man for the day

187
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,180
but this day has passed and we I actually on this one I

188
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,500
Desperately. Yeah need a resolution on this. Please send a follow-up email. I need to know

189
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,580
How this how this one all shook out only if it's not terrible, right? We won't read it if it's terrible

190
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,460
Let's say well, I mean if something if something happened to the gator, right?

191
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,580
Gators fine. Okay, because the gators just being the gator the gator

192
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:45,220
This is the scorpion here and or yes, the gators the scorpion and your boss is the frog who's like

193
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,340
I'll swim you across the water

194
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,260
I'll fish you out of the drain if you promise not to bite me in the game like oh, yeah

195
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,860
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got it. You got it. You got it. You got it

196
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,020
Hey, can we approach though the wizard and

197
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Is the wizard a gator?

198
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,580
Let me check. Nah

199
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,500
He's he's mostly human

200
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,100
oh, and he's a lot he is actually and when I say cloud I am talking about the digital cloud because he is like

201
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,800
It's like a daemon a daemon that exists sort of in the cyber oasis

202
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah that we like to party yet and have like cool digi raves and stuff. We're

203
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,140
We look at animated gifs that get you fucked up and everybody's just like ASL ASL

204
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,140
But the side the wizard one a cyber one a cyber Monday

205
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,740
Um, yeah, that's the only day you're legally allowed to make digital love at the oasis

206
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,020
This one is sent in by Hannah. Thank you, Hannah

207
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,660
It is a wiki how article that is titled how to react to to an ugly, baby

208
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,020
Oh, no, you've just seen a picture of your friend's new baby. And well, they aren't the cutest baby you've ever seen

209
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,340
Just say like stand by your convictions. They're they are not a good baby

210
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,820
Now you have to figure out what to do and say to the new parents start by controlling your reaction and find something about

211
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,300
The baby you can't compliment. Okay, you say oh, is that the new iPhone? Oh, boom. You're out of there, right?

212
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,060
Yeah, about that iPhone and all the megapixels. Yeah, that's a that's a really good way to do the whole thing on one sort of

213
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,780
Jump, but I would love to get a little bit more granular one. Don't say anything at all. Awesome

214
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
What do you think of little?

215
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
When you say nothing

216
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
smile on my baby's face

217
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:33,340
Face ain't appealing but at least it's not his little heart that you're stealing

218
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,460
the truth is he has 14 eyes and

219
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
17 years

220
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Say it best

221
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Is it oh, okay

222
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:57,020
It's a bold. It's a bold both of this the recommendation of the song and wiki. How are a bold sort of no

223
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,460
Say nothing. What do you think of little Douglas's beautiful face? Yeah, I can say

224
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,420
It's not great for a podcast. Okay. What do you think of my baby?

225
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,940
What's that a groan of satisfaction

226
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,500
Okay, next step have a small talk ready. Hey, this is little Douglas. What do you think of his amazing face?

227
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Did you guys see?

228
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,940
Kevin Hart last night on

229
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
the television screen

230
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,980
Yeah, but what do you think about little Douglas? He did a joke

231
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,880
about his wild kitty cat

232
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,860
What about just focus on the parents awesome, what do you think of little Douglas

233
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,820
Wow, did you just get a haircut? I mean, what do you think about little Douglas that necklace is so chunky and beautiful

234
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,780
I think you took a great photo. What about that? Oh

235
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,620
Man, did you study photo composition in college?

236
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,540
I think you took a great photo, what about that?

237
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,300
Oh man, did you study photo composition in college?

238
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh, that's great.

239
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,980
This is so good.

240
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,860
Oh, rule of thirds, man, nice, nice, nice.

241
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,220
Well, you could go with this, like, so thoughtful.

242
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,060
Oh.

243
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,880
Look at that.

244
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,720
He's got a lot on his mind.

245
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,200
That's an old soul.

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,040
Yeah.

247
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,300
Yeah, that's an old soul.

248
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
It is.

249
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,180
It was just not loudly announced.

250
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,260
It's so cool they're making another Benjamin.

251
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,580
Hey, what do you think of this baby?

252
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,380
That baby's seen some shit.

253
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,560
Oh, yeah.

254
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,940
Look at, oh, haunted.

255
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,580
That baby's haunted, I love it.

256
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,060
Oh, no country for old babies, am I right?

257
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,740
Put yourself in their shoes.

258
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,580
Yeah, that's not fun.

259
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,780
No, I don't want to do that.

260
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,620
Oh, no good.

261
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,140
Remember, not everyone has the same tastes.

262
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,340
I mean, yeah, some people, I guess,

263
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,060
love some Gargamel ass looking babies.

264
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,180
There's probably a community for that out there.

265
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,020
What about this?

266
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,020
What about an acknowledgement that sounds like a positive?

267
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,540
Okay.

268
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,360
Like this.

269
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,820
Check out this, check out a little bit of this.

270
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,180
Oh, yeah, that's a baby right there.

271
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, yeah.

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,140
Oh, for sure.

273
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,820
That's definitely not a baby.

274
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,500
Baby, huh, am I right?

275
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,340
Baby.

276
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,700
Let's go on to method two,

277
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
which is complimenting the baby.

278
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,540
Step one.

279
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,980
So lying.

280
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,940
No, listen.

281
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
Oh, no.

282
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,700
Compliment the baby's expression.

283
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,980
One thing you can compliment is the expressions

284
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,820
the baby makes.

285
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,380
Maybe the baby's especially bubbly

286
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,140
or they look very serious and thoughtful.

287
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,420
Either way, use that information

288
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,260
to compliment the baby.

289
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,020
Oh my God, I just pre-cogged a wiki out.

290
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,860
He looks, wow, what a stern.

291
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,740
What do you think, little Douglas?

292
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,100
So stern.

293
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,940
Wow.

294
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,780
Stern.

295
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,020
That's a commanding baby right there.

296
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,820
Oh, God pity the poor criminal

297
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,500
who stands before Judge Baby, am I right?

298
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,060
Wow.

299
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,180
Pick something cute about the baby.

300
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,580
What do you think, little Douglas?

301
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,620
Great diaper.

302
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,740
What brand is that?

303
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,660
It's so playful.

304
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,280
Very playful diaper on Douglas.

305
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,620
Sydney taught me about this thing

306
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,940
called reaction formation.

307
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,820
You guys know about this?

308
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
No.

309
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,820
Reaction formation is,

310
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,780
I'm gonna read you the scientific thing,

311
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,380
is a fixation in consciousness of an idea

312
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,520
where one's own rejected tendencies

313
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,140
and reaction formation turn,

314
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,740
okay, this is too complicated.

315
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,580
Yes.

316
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,400
But basically it is,

317
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,100
a reaction formation is a defense mechanism

318
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,440
where you have an emotion or impulse

319
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,040
that is very anxiety producing or unacceptable,

320
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,580
and you deal with it in the instant

321
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,100
by an exaggeration of a directly opposing tendency.

322
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,520
By which I mean, you see the bad baby

323
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,260
and you say, ah, an extremely good,

324
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,580
best baby I've ever seen.

325
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,500
Sure.

326
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,340
And now I've become very paranoid

327
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,020
about not doing that.

328
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,060
And now if people are very positive

329
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,860
about something that I have done

330
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,580
or a hair kind of thing that I'm doing,

331
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,420
I will often wonder, is this reaction formation?

332
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,940
Because they're being very,

333
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,500
they're praising me a lot.

334
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,460
I wonder if this is a reaction formation.

335
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,860
Well, you can't assume, Justin,

336
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,860
that every other human being shares your anxiety.

337
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,860
So it's possible that they do like the thing you're doing.

338
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,020
What are the odds?

339
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,860
What are the odds though, Travis?

340
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,700
What are the odds?

341
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,340
This is why, is there a slightly positive thing

342
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,180
you could say that,

343
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,500
where you see it and you're like, oh, cool baby.

344
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,780
And it's like, well, if they were trying to sell me a line,

345
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,340
they would have pushed it harder.

346
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,820
But it sounds like that's the realest shit, right?

347
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
Yeah.

348
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,480
Yeah.

349
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,320
Because if someone's like,

350
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,800
what do you think of my Douglas' little face?

351
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,460
And you go, fuck yeah, Douglas.

352
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,220
Yeah, Douglas, looking good, baby.

353
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,060
Yum, yum.

354
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,860
Compliment the baby's outfit.

355
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,640
That one's a dead giveaway.

356
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,780
What do you think of my Douglas?

357
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,240
His shorts, get a seal of approval from me.

358
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,860
That's especially bad if they show you the picture

359
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,580
and that's what you're prepared to do.

360
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,340
And then the baby's just in a diaper.

361
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,820
And you're like, sick diaper, bro.

362
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,720
Yeah.

363
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,060
Say something nice about the baby's temperament.

364
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,540
What do you think of my Douglas?

365
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,020
He's so loud.

366
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,340
It's great.

367
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,820
Based off that picture, I can tell he's really cool-headed.

368
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,780
Great in a crisis.

369
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,180
Even keeled.

370
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,400
That's definitely, that's the baby I want on my team

371
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,300
when I go urban exploring.

372
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,140
Yeah.

373
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,700
He looks like he's really working on himself.

374
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,640
You know what I mean?

375
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,020
Very introspective, baby.

376
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,900
You can see it.

377
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
There's a lot going on behind the eyes.

378
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,520
This is a baby?

379
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,900
This is a baby?

380
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,780
Is this your baby or is this kind of like a sample?

381
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, is this one of those, like,

382
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,980
what would they look like if you had a baby

383
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,500
like that you and your partner did?

384
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,220
And that's why it looks like the way it does?

385
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,380
Is that, no, this is your, oh, this is a baby.

386
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,740
Oh, what about, this is my Douglas.

387
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,020
That's your Douglas?

388
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,860
This isn't some sort of famous Douglas that you downloaded?

389
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,460
I thought that was the platonic ideal of Douglas.

390
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,300
I thought this was some sort of fake, fake Douglas,

391
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,740
sort of a...

392
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,820
You fed all the Douglas's into an AI

393
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,020
and this is what it produced.

394
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,180
This is an algorithmically produced Douglas.

395
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,380
Surely, surely.

396
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,260
This is just the perfect example

397
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,980
of what a Douglas could be, right?

398
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
That there's a Douglas.

399
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,820
That's definitely a Douglas.

400
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,140
Hey, you nailed it on the naming.

401
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,980
I look at that.

402
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,220
You can just tell he's a Douglas.

403
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,060
Look at that.

404
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,140
That's a Douglas face right there, my friend.

405
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,740
I want you to meet my son, Douglas.

406
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,100
Fuck yeah, dude.

407
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,740
Basic instinct.

408
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,180
Wall Street.

409
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
Get it, dude.

410
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,020
Yeah.

411
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Oh, sorry.

412
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,260
Wall Street two, money never sleeps.

413
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,500
Good shit.

414
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,660
His wife's in Zorro.

415
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Fuck.

416
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,340
Yeah, dude.

417
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,180
Yeah.

418
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,100
Some community Q&A here.

419
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,940
This one's pretty wild.

420
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,820
What if the parents think the baby's ugly too?

421
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,140
You can laugh with the parents,

422
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,700
but this behavior should stop as the child grows.

423
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
Pretty cool.

424
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,820
Parents, these are, I love these parents.

425
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,660
What if, okay, hey.

426
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,020
Yeah, we didn't get it quite right.

427
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Wookie there.

428
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,700
Look at my baby.

429
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,540
Oh, can you imagine?

430
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,380
Look at this baby.

431
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,140
And you're ready for your friend to be like,

432
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,180
yeah, that's an ugly baby.

433
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,220
And your friend's like, oh, beautiful.

434
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,980
And now you're thinking, oh God, I'm the worst.

435
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,580
Oh God, is there something wrong with me?

436
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,740
What if the child thinks I'm ugly?

437
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,580
That's okay.

438
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,700
Kids can be very loud and opinionated.

439
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,540
Don't let it bother you.

440
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,060
If the child's repeatedly making rude comments

441
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,380
about your parents, talk to the parents about it.

442
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,460
That's pretty, that's delicious though, isn't it?

443
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,980
If you're like, hmm, little Douglas, I've seen better.

444
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,060
And then in the future they're like,

445
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,500
you're a fucked up skunk face, my man.

446
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,460
You stink and you suck.

447
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,660
Little Douglas is saying this to me?

448
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
Yeah.

449
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,900
I deserve it probably at that point.

450
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,740
You definitely do.

451
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,580
If I said to little Douglas,

452
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,820
you got a real Douglas face.

453
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,380
And then he's like, you got Douglas face.

454
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,540
I'm like, whoa, words hurt, man.

455
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,460
Whoa, shit.

456
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,780
Oh, look at the baby and be like,

457
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,940
I bet he has a great sense of humor.

458
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,500
Well, you could also just make a joke and move on.

459
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,340
It's like, this is my baby.

460
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,180
You can be like, very nice.

461
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,820
Nailed it.

462
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,780
Yeah, he's great success.

463
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,060
Yeah, he's crawling now.

464
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,660
Oh, how are you, how are you, my wife?

465
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,660
God, it's so, why does only he get to be Borat?

466
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,500
It's not fair at all.

467
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,540
It doesn't seem like he does, Justin.

468
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,700
It seems like everybody gets their 15 minutes of Borat.

469
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,780
I know, but I want more.

470
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,300
Can I put on a one man stage show called Borap?

471
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,740
And it's a different guy, but he's pretty similar.

472
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,660
And also he does some pretty cool raps.

473
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,740
Yeah, he does, he's got some good raps.

474
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,580
That's it.

475
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,820
We need to do something else now

476
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,340
because we haven't done enough show yet.

477
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,180
Okay, well, how about another question?

478
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,100
I've put together some great ones this week.

479
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
I would love it.

480
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,940
I don't want to brag.

481
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,780
Okay.

482
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,180
You clearly do.

483
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,420
There's a person in my job

484
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,020
who I see every day painting minifigurines

485
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,020
or in the parlance, minifigs.

486
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,780
His setup has the whole deal.

487
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,340
A briefcase with the figures, paint, brushes,

488
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,940
the whole nine yards.

489
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,220
And I'm wildly intrigued.

490
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,340
I got to say, question asker,

491
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,740
those are the components I would have guessed going in.

492
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,540
Maybe not the briefcase, to be fair.

493
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
Yeah, that's awesome.

494
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,900
What, you're just going to carry him in a tote bag, Justin?

495
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,380
Just a loose Walmart bag.

496
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,200
I want to ask him about it.

497
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,900
However, I don't know how.

498
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,500
Most people we work with would just ask him in a judgy way.

499
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,700
How do I ask him about his beautiful minis

500
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,120
without sounding like I'm trying to shame him?

501
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,220
That's from what you play in there in Wisconsin.

502
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,900
There's an aspect of this question, by the way,

503
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,300
hearing it out loud that I had not considered,

504
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,080
which is, is your coworker just like doing this

505
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,180
at his desk in the middle of the workday,

506
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,940
just pulling out some favorite, I'm like-

507
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,780
And it's kind of wild, isn't it?

508
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,820
Yeah, isn't it?

509
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,780
Like the boss is going to come by and want to say something,

510
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,780
but it will be so mind boggling that this isn't just like,

511
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,420
oh, I was playing peggle on my phone or whatever.

512
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,460
That it's just like, oh, you have a whole thing set up.

513
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,500
It's fucking awesome though.

514
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,220
I'm imagining this person, like the boss comes out

515
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,660
and is like, okay, everybody, 30 minutes lunch break.

516
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,780
And this guy just like horks down a, you know,

517
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,860
chicken salad sandwich in like two bites.

518
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,600
And then so he can pop off his briefcase

519
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,080
and have 29 minutes to really do some painting.

520
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,060
I like that.

521
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,360
I like that lifestyle.

522
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,500
That's good for me.

523
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,420
I think you can't ask questions.

524
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,260
You have to just do a compliment like,

525
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,180
oh, great detail work on the angel wings.

526
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,660
I don't know what figures these are, but like-

527
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,100
Yeah, I mean, I imagine it's like, you know,

528
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,620
D&D or Warhammer, right?

529
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,460
Yeah, stuff like that.

530
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,280
I mean, it could be like little soldiers.

531
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,120
It could be.

532
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,960
Yeah, I guess it could be little souls.

533
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,780
Thank you, Travis.

534
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,620
What other little things are there?

535
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,460
Tiny angels.

536
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,300
Okay, yeah, well-

537
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,740
Tiny angels is true.

538
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,260
You know, I think that there's a misconception that like,

539
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,120
if you've made it to this point in your adult life,

540
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,620
and you've probably heard, I would say,

541
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,340
all the things that people know to say

542
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,460
about you painting tiny figures at your desk

543
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,840
while you're supposed to be working,

544
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,140
I think that you've probably made your peace with it, right?

545
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,460
You're doing it because you enjoy it,

546
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,900
not because you think, like,

547
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,620
nobody is going to, like, shame you at this point.

548
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,220
You are unshamable, right?

549
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,540
You've gotten this far.

550
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,020
I don't think you should be afraid of that.

551
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
I think they probably would just like to

552
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,340
maybe talk about the figures.

553
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,180
Yeah, I think if you-

554
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,100
Like, that seems like an open invitation, right?

555
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,820
If they were ashamed of it,

556
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,500
they probably wouldn't be, like, doing it

557
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,700
while they're supposed to be flying the plane

558
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,340
or whatever, you know, it is.

559
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,780
Heart surgery.

560
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,620
Yeah, right.

561
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,780
Now, I will say, there is also the possibility

562
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
that this person's like,

563
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,240
oh, thank God, a chance to work on my figurines.

564
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,900
And you're like, tell me about it!

565
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,300
And they're like, I have 45 minutes to finish,

566
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,780
so please don't ask me questions about my figurine.

567
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,820
This is why I hid it in the supply closet.

568
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,100
Why do you come in here every day, too?

569
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,940
Fuck.

570
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,780
Can I tell you what I think?

571
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,600
I want to give you, I don't know,

572
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,700
can I tell you what I think?

573
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,520
What?

574
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,360
Can I tell you guys what I think?

575
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,200
Yeah.

576
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,820
I think, if I'm, I'm not,

577
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,520
now, I might be projecting, I might be off,

578
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,540
but I'm going to guess on something here.

579
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,500
I think that this question asker's hesitancy,

580
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,780
if you were to, like, dig down deep,

581
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,220
because I feel this way, too,

582
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,540
and tell me if I'm wrong, let's just say this,

583
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,940
but I feel like their hesitancy has less to do

584
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,340
with the fact that they are worried

585
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,180
that this person doesn't want to talk about their figs.

586
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,620
And I think it's because maybe this person

587
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,100
doesn't know a lot about the figs, the figs,

588
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,880
and they're afraid of seeming kind of stupid about it.

589
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,940
Because, like, that would be me, is like,

590
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,100
I would see, like, that is definitely

591
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,060
within the Venn diagram, right?

592
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,940
That's in the atmosphere of things that I would like,

593
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,460
and I would be curious about,

594
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,140
but I wouldn't want to say, like, some stupid shit.

595
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,380
Like, do you use Sharpies, or whatever?

596
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,140
I don't even know what a dumb question is.

597
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
Is thems from Monopoly?

598
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,720
There's a 90% chance that no matter how much

599
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,020
you, like, practice in your head,

600
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,420
I think that you're going to walk up

601
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,440
and you're going to open your mouth,

602
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,460
and the phrase, so, painting figs, is going to come out.

603
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,860
And you're like, God damn.

604
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,220
You can write a whole monologue

605
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,780
and still accidentally deliver that one.

606
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,060
It's a thing where, like,

607
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,980
I think some people misread sometimes,

608
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,780
or are afraid that ignorance will be misread as judgment.

609
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,580
Like, if I valued this,

610
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,460
I probably would have learned about it by now.

611
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,380
By this point, I would have taken some time

612
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,220
to educate myself.

613
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,700
At best, you might come across as, like,

614
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
condescending small talk.

615
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,820
You're like, oh, so figurines, huh?

616
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,260
So you have to, you got to ameliorate yourself

617
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,460
with this individual.

618
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,900
I tell you what I would do,

619
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,980
is I would go into the bathroom,

620
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,660
would change clothes, I would throw on

621
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,340
a big baggy denim overalls,

622
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,940
and let one of the straps hang down.

623
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,420
And I would walk up there with, like,

624
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,080
a old matted up paintbrush, and just be like,

625
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,180
you need any help?

626
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,020
Hey, hey, Tom, need help painting that fence?

627
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,100
I don't, hey, listen, I don't like working either.

628
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,900
Can I help you? Can I please help?

629
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,140
You have a perfect scam here,

630
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,420
and I don't know how you're pulling it off,

631
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,140
and I want to cut.

632
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,220
Oh, get on the phone, right?

633
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,340
Or you can probably fake this phone call,

634
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,220
and just be like, yeah, sis, yeah, no,

635
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,700
I do want to get into painting figurines.

636
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,340
You know I've talked about this for years,

637
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,180
but I don't even know where to start.

638
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,100
Like, really loudly, but not so loudly

639
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,180
that it seems like a bit.

640
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,340
That's, no, it is a bit, though, it's just a bit.

641
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,660
I mean, I know, listen,

642
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,540
but why have you been taking those acting classes for years

643
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,940
if not for this moment, question asker?

644
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,500
I'm tired, I'm tired of you supplicating yourself

645
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,580
to this stranger.

646
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,940
Listen, I need you to take bigger figs.

647
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,460
Oh, awesome.

648
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,020
Like a Barbie?

649
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,220
Like big figs, yeah, like a Barbie,

650
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,420
like an action man.

651
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,140
Like fig figs, you know.

652
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,300
Just big figs.

653
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,380
Big figs for big boys.

654
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,180
Centurions, or descendants, or like big figs.

655
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,140
Get a full-size, get a six-foot statue, a marble statue.

656
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,500
Get a marble statue and go in there and paint a big fig,

657
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,100
and be like, oh, nice little fig.

658
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,140
Oh, I see, I see you're still at the starting point

659
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,980
with the little ones.

660
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,260
You'll work your way up to the big ones someday.

661
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,900
I remember when I used to paint little figs

662
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,380
when I was a little boy.

663
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,980
When I was a little person, I painted little figs,

664
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,940
but now I'm a big person, and I paint big figs.

665
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,820
And I've put such frivolous things away,

666
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,220
and now it's only big figs and big work for me,

667
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,940
because I got big responsibilities.

668
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,180
Would it be helpful to bring some of the figs-

669
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,620
People rely on me.

670
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,900
I don't have time for individual little figs.

671
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,380
I gotta get these big figs done

672
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,820
so I can pay taxes and feed my family.

673
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,220
Would it be helpful

674
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,460
if you brought some of the heat off of this person,

675
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,540
and whenever they were painting their figs,

676
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,100
you went over to your cubicle

677
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,660
and put on a big puffy white hat

678
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,620
and started to throw pizza dough in the air,

679
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,460
just going like,

680
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,780
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da.

681
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,420
And the boss would be like, what are you doing?

682
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,500
And you'd be like, my passion?

683
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,180
My passion and my hobby?

684
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,500
I thought this was my time.

685
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,780
Break time is my time, is what you said.

686
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,620
And they'll be like,

687
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,460
you don't have any pizza sauce, a cooking surface.

688
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,900
And you're like, no, it's just the dough.

689
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,820
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

690
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,260
You want me to start with the sauce?

691
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,900
Then what would I put it on, genius?

692
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,220
And if the boss is like,

693
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,580
you're gonna be written up for this.

694
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,620
I'm gonna go eat now.

695
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
And they walk away,

696
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,980
and you stand up and look at the figs guy

697
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,300
and just nod your head knowingly.

698
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
And then you're in, baby.

699
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,500
What, along those same lines,

700
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,140
you could just go to their desk and be like,

701
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,860
listen, Peterson, if you don't have all my figs painted,

702
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,780
by the end of the day, it's your job.

703
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,260
I don't know if you have the ability to fire this.

704
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,100
That's cool.

705
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,540
Or you could just be like, come on, Jefferson,

706
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,780
the client is waiting on those figs.

707
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,900
Okay, this one's really funny.

708
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,820
You ready?

709
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,860
Go over to him.

710
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,020
Wait, I wasn't ready.

711
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,180
Hold on.

712
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,420
Okay, get ready.

713
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,260
Okay.

714
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,940
Go over to him and be like,

715
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,420
hey, that seems cool.

716
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,660
I don't know anything about it.

717
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,980
Would you mind telling me about it?

718
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,860
I wasn't ready.

719
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,700
I know.

720
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
And if you do that, maybe you could be.

721
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,540
I know.

722
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,340
That would work on me.

723
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,180
Yeah.

724
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,020
You know?

725
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,180
If I was like doing a wood thing at work,

726
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,260
maybe like carving one of my famous little fellas.

727
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,380
You ever see Justin McElroy's Little Fellows

728
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,220
on Etsy?

729
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,060
Yeah.

730
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
That's you?

731
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,740
That's me.

732
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,180
That's the Justin McElroy of Justin McElroy's Little Fellows.

733
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,100
I thought it was the Canadian Justin McElroy

734
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,340
that was really in the Little Fellas.

735
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,300
No, no.

736
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,060
CBC Justin McElroy is not the guy who,

737
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,740
he paints the Little Fellas for me.

738
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,820
That's why, if you ever look at the apostrophe

739
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,380
after Justin McElroy's Little Fellas,

740
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,060
the apostrophe is actually after the S.

741
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,900
Oh, it's right.

742
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,740
McElroy's is.

743
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,580
Okay, got it.

744
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,260
Justin McElroy's Little Fellas.

745
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,100
Got it, got it.

746
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,940
It makes a lot more sense.

747
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,780
And it's L-I-L apostrophe.

748
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,860
Right.

749
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,620
F-E-L-L-A-Z.

750
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,740
Justin McElroy's Little Fellas.

751
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,580
Right.

752
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,860
And they are just little people toys,

753
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,340
but they're just the boy ones

754
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,380
and the other Justin McElroy paints over them.

755
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,980
But you buy them in the first place.

756
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
No, I car, no, I whittle them.

757
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,060
Oh, okay.

758
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,500
I whittle them from wood.

759
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,020
That's the wood part that I'm doing.

760
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,860
Right.

761
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,900
And then Canadian Justin McElroy,

762
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,900
or Justin McElroy, he paints the Little Fellas.

763
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,460
Now, I happen to need to ask you, Justin,

764
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,020
now that I know that that's you,

765
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,020
why do you make them all look like Griffin?

766
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,380
Yeah, that's a weird thing, man.

767
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
When I think fisherman,

768
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,100
which all the Little Fellas are fishermen,

769
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,180
when I think fishermen, I think Griffin.

770
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,220
Okay, yeah, I get that.

771
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,180
You do make a lot where a big fish is jumping up

772
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,460
and trying to pull down the back of my pants

773
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,900
so that my little hiney shows.

774
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,020
And different poses, too.

776
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,060
Like you sell- Like 75% of them.

777
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,020
I made one of those for a special promotion

778
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,580
for the March of Dimes.

779
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,060
And they sold so well that they actually became

780
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,340
sort of the default Little Fellas.

781
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,220
Oh, it became like the look.

782
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,060
Griffin's hiney.

783
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,020
That became like the quintessential.

784
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,020
If you ever see them pop up on Auntie's Rude Show,

785
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,180
you'll see those referred to as like retro Little Fellas

786
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,780
if they don't have the fish jumping up

787
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,620
and pulling down Griffin's pants.

788
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,980
Now- You can see his tiny wooden hide.

789
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,500
Just one more thing there, because like, I think-

790
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,020
I wish Justin, other Justin would paint the butts.

791
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,140
Because they're just perfect alabaster butts.

792
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,020
He says it's the same-

793
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,540
To be fair, that does match Griffin's hiney.

794
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,580
But I also, I think-

795
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,540
Yeah, no, I like the fact that you didn't give Griffin

796
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,300
like a cutesy facial expression about that.

797
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,980
It's abject horror at a fish, but like, yeah.

798
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,340
And it's like not a gim.

799
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,460
Yeah, right, right, right.

800
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,420
That this is like, that each individual figurine

801
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,580
is a separate occasion of this happening.

802
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,420
Yeah.

803
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,500
That Griffin has had to live through.

804
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,340
It's fucked up also that you used

805
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,300
a sort of photorealistic rendition

806
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,300
of my gnarled, eroded 34-year-old face on all of them.

807
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,500
Yeah.

808
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,900
It is, I mean, it's incredible work and detail that you do,

809
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
but it does sort of make the pose a little bit-

810
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,580
I thought it was 3D printed, frankly.

811
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,220
Yeah, people say that a lot.

812
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,700
This is actually gonna kind of mess up my rep,

813
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,100
but I'm actually not making enough off the Little Fellas

814
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,940
to support my-

815
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,900
It's a labor of love.

816
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,700
Yeah, it's more of a labor of love.

817
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,100
The Little Fellas are a loss leader for the Big Fellas.

818
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,940
If I can say it's my ministry.

819
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,460
Yeah, it's my ministry.

820
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,500
Really.

821
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,860
So as a result, I would like you guys

822
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,100
to follow me to the Monday Sun.

823
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,940
Okay.

824
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,780
It's better, it's better with you.

825
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,980
Stamps.

826
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,940
I love them, you love them.

827
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,820
Fuck yeah.

828
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,820
They're stickers that carry your words and things to places.

829
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,660
Think about that for just one second.

830
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,260
You're getting pretty hype about these stamps, Trav.

831
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,220
I just, if you really think about a stamp, Griffin,

832
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,060
it's bonkers.

833
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,900
It's fucked up, yeah.

834
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,740
It's fucked up.

835
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,900
These stickers, like the stickers I collect

836
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,140
that have like cool dolphins and shit on them,

837
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,380
they transmit my thoughts around the fucking globe.

838
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,220
Think about that.

839
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,060
And that's messed up.

840
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,020
Like two seconds, you guys.

841
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,780
And then think about being able to do that

842
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,380
without having to go anywhere.

843
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,500
Well, I'm not God.

844
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,060
So I don't think I can create my own stamps.

845
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,900
Oh, but you know who is God?

846
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,140
Stamps.com is God.

847
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Oh, all right.

848
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,380
Our stamps are some awesome stamps.

849
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,460
They're stickers, but not having dolphins.

850
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,580
That's my song I wrote about stamps.

851
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,420
I love it.

852
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,580
As far as I know, there is no dolphin-shaped stamps.

853
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,660
Not yet.

854
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,620

864
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,060

Hey, you remember that commercial for Orbit gum?

875
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,980
Oh yeah.

876
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,500
Where the people are arguing and the woman's like,

877
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,620
who are you calling a cootie queen, you lint licker?

878
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,980
Griffin, I just re-watched that on YouTube

879
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,460
like three days ago.

880
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,300
That's wild.

881
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,980
And it's like dirty mouth.

882
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,500
So I guess anyway, do you have a dirty mouth?

883
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,380
Me?

884
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,260
That's a, man, outside of the context

885
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,500
of us doing a Quip commercial,

886
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
if I ever genuinely asked anybody,

887
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,300
hey, do you have a dirty mouth?

888
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,580
They would get, I would be removed from the premises

889
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,060
of whatever building I was in.

890
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,020
You also just kind of name dropped a different gum brand

891
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,860
in there too.

892
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,220
I'm pretty sure they're dead and gone.

893
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm pretty sure.

894
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,940
Orbits?

895
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,980
Yeah, the gum?

896
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,060
Hold on, let me Google,

897
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,300
because you're right, that would get us in trouble.

898
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,540
The brand was discontinued after the war ended.

899
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,580
What the fuck?

900
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,420
Where am I?

901
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Wait, what?

902
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,420
Orbit was launched in 1890.

903
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,900
Orbit was launched in, sorry Quip,

904
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,180
we're gonna start your commercial over here

905
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,020
in just a second.

906
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,860
Orbit was started in 1899?

907
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,820
Okay, yeah, I guess Orbit's still out there.

908
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,220
Anyway, that's the end of the free Orbit commercial.

909
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,820
Hey, Quip is excellent.

910
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,940
They have the better gum that cleans your teeth.

911
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,060
It's better in every way.

912
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,260
And that's just me saying that,

913
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,540
that it's not in the copy for,

914
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,020
oh fuck, I'm sweating now.

915
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
Listen, it's the holidays

916
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,500
and your mouth is putting in work right now, isn't it?

917
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,660
Eating, drinking up eggnog,

918
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,460
that stuff gets on your teeth and lives there for a while.

919
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,740
So don't worry about that though,

920
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,020
cause you got better oral care with Quip,

921
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,460
the company with the best gum.

922
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,300
They have this built-in two minute timer

923
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,260
that pulses every 30 seconds in the toothbrush,

924
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,140
not in the gum,

925
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,060
cause that would be pretty fucked up

926
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,260
if your gum started to pulsate

927
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,140
and it helps you clean your mouth the right way.

928
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,380
They have a cover that your toothbrush like lives in

929
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,660
and then you can sort of pop it off

930
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,300
and put it right on top of the toothbrush

931
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,340
and it turns it into a little protective armor

932
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,460
so you can pack up your Quip on the go.

933
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,740
And they also can deliver fresh floss, toothpaste,

934
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,220
mouthwash and the best fucking gum in the business

935
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,700
every three months from up to $5.

936
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,980
Shipping is free, so you can save money

937
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,340
and skip the hustle and bustle of shopping

938
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,300
and store during the holidays and into the new year

939
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,940
or for the rest of your life.

940
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,020

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,140
Quip, the good habits company.

948
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,780
Please do not tell on me for this commercial.

949
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,980
Hello, I'm Pee Wee Herman.

950
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,860
You might know me from TV,

951
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,380
but I really want to be a DJ.

952
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,980
It took some convincing,

953
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,820
but KCRW finally agreed to give me an hour on the radio

954
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,460
to play you some music with my friends.

955
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,380
Anyway, tune in for one hour of the bestest,

956
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,260
most funnest time you'll ever have

957
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,900
on the Pee Wee Herman radio hour.

958
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,700
I am personally inviting you

959
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,620
to tune your transistor radio in to hear me

960
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,860
or go to kcrw.com, duh.

961
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,580
It'll be available for the whole week

962
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,140
from November 26th to December 3rd.

963
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,980
So you can listen to it again and again and again

964
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,100
and again and again.

965
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,020
The Pee Wee Herman radio hour was produced by Maximum Fun

966
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,420
and can be streamed on kcrw.com until December 3rd.

967
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,220
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

968
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,060
Yeah.

969
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,900
Oh.

970
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,740
Wait.

971
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,140
Digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi.

972
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,500
Digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi.

973
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,340
That was bad.

974
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,180
Okay.

975
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,460
I want to munch.

976
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,300
Squad?

977
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,140
How is it possible?

978
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,340
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

979
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,740
I want to munch.

980
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,580
Okay, squad.

981
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,420
Squad.

982
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,020
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

983
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,660
It is almost December.

984
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,420
Hello.

985
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,260
Yeah.

986
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,820
I'm here whenever there are donuts to discuss.

987
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,660
Okay.

988
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,660
This is not a Halloween,

989
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,460
I am not a Halloween creation

990
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,780
and I am not who you think I am.

991
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,620
Okay.

992
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,860
Who do you believe me to be?

993
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,140
I mean, I feels like a trick question

994
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,060
because I really believe in my heart and soul

995
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,340
that you are Count Donut.

996
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,180
Yes, I get that a lot.

997
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,060
Okay.

998
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,580
I am Count Donuts Jr.

999
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,420
What?

1000
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,820
But please call me Rick.

1001
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,540
Rick Donut?

1002
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,380
This show does not-

1003
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,300
Yes, Count Donut is my dad.

1004
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,140
Right.

1005
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,820
He covers donuts, me?

1006
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,460
I cover donut holes.

1007
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,500
Okay.

1008
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
We did not need more characters

1009
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,020
or Count Donut lore on this show.

1010
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,340
You said characters were-

1011
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,220
No, we didn't.

1012
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,900
Okay.

1013
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,740
So you're here with some cool holes for us, Rick.

1014
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,420
Yes.

1015
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,100
Can we call you Rick Holes instead?

1016
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
I prefer you didn't.

1017
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,380
I prefer you didn't call me Rick.

1018
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,740
Rick Holes is good though.

1019
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,860
Mr. Donut Jr. would be fine.

1020
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,220
Okay, fine.

1021
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,740
So I sound like my father, I realize this,

1022
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,540
but try to-

1023
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,380
We sound like dad, it's fine.

1024
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,340
I think you'll tell the difference very quickly.

1025
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,300
Dudes.

1026
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,140
Oh!

1027
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,980
Awesome.

1028
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,860
Oh, fuck yeah, now I'm on board, dude.

1029
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,260
Yes, come with me.

1030
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,780
Why don't you dap on over to this story here

1031
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,380
that I have for you?

1032
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,420
Tim Hortons has teamed up with Justin Bieber.

1033
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,380
Awesome.

1034
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,940
Yes, it is awesome, Griffin.

1035
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,780
Thank you.

1036
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,100
He's teamed up with Justin Bieber to make-

1037
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,860
Bieber bites, please.

1038
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,020
No, this is a good guess, Travis.

1039
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,660
Beeb holes?

1040
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,500
Come on.

1041
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,340
Beeb holes.

1042
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,900
Come on, sweetheart, you can get one up.

1043
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,980
Beeb holes?

1044
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,460
Sorry, you think it might be beeb holes?

1045
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,660
Not now.

1046
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,300
Not now that I've said it.

1047
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,420
Yes, my tongue gave it away.

1048
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,020
No, no, they're Tim Beebs.

1049
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,940
So you know that the Timbit is the tiny version

1050
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,540
of a Tim Hortons donut,

1051
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,620
the sweet succulent nut from the middle of the dough.

1052
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,260
The true nut of the donut, ironically.

1053
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,180
So that's what they call the Timbit,

1054
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,900
but now, make way for Tim Beebs.

1055
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,380
And I don't have to move,

1056
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,340
I don't actually have to move that far

1057
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,740
to make way for Tim Beebs.

1058
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,820
It's like a little nudge to the left.

1059
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,220
It's like an inch and a half,

1060
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,220
or, you know, in Canada, 15 centimeters.

1061
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,260
I do not think that that good version-

1062
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,300
It doesn't feel right.

1063
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,700
It doesn't at all.

1064
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,860
I don't think that's right at all.

1065
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,260
It doesn't feel right to say.

1066
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,340
Let's see, 15 centimeters to inches

1067
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,620
is almost six inches, so-

1068
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,500
That would be a hell of a Tim Beeb.

1069
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,300
Yes, this is the thing about Tim Beebs,

1070
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,380
he's gigantic.

1071
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,220
He was compensating.

1072
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,340
He started with baby, baby, baby donuts,

1073
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,100
big donut, big donut, big donut.

1074
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,820
No, it's Tim Beebs, it's small.

1075
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,100
Tim Hortons has teamed up

1076
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,460
with pop superstar Justin Bieber.

1077
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,020
This was sent to us by Daniel,

1078
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,020
and the story is on CBC.

1079
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,740
All right.

1080
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,100
Home of dragons.

1081
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,580
And other Justin McElroy, I think.

1082
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,060
And other Justin McElroy.

1083
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,260
Yes, if only this had been written

1084
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,940
by my friend, Justin McElroy.

1085
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,420
Oh, you guys are close?

1086
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,700
I would never kill him.

1087
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,540
Oh.

1088
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,700
Not in the way that I killed Justin regularly.

1089
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,540
Listen, this is my first time in this body.

1090
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,260
I forgot my rich fiction.

1091
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,260
Tim Hortons teamed up with Tim Beebs

1092
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,860
for co-branded merchandise.

1093
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,740
The celebrity endorsement deal

1094
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,060
marks a departure from the coffee

1095
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,540
and donut chain's usual lineup

1096
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,140
of professional hockey players.

1097
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,700
A marketing strategy that could help attract

1098
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,260
a different demographic.

1099
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,380
Yes, CBC, I think that there is not a ton of overlap

1100
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,580
between Beeb heads and a hockey fan.

1101
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,020
Hey, how do you know that, Count Donut Junior?

1102
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,060
That's very judgmental.

1103
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,980
This is my thing.

1104
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,540
I make snap judgments about subcultures

1105
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,620
I don't understand.

1106
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,820
Okay.

1107
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,940
That's Rick.

1108
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,620
That's Rick, baby.

1109
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,620
That's Rick, baby.

1110
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,500
The partnership aligns with the Canadian singer's

1111
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,940
frequent social media posts about the restaurant,

1112
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,620
which have ranged from snapshots

1113
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,980
of a holiday-themed Tim's cup

1114
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,980
to complaints about the new lid.

1115
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,660
Oh, okay.

1116
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,500
All right.

1117
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,900
Doing a Tim Hortons,

1118
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,740
hold on, let me do my Beeb voice.

1119
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,580
Doing a Tim Hortons collab

1120
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,500
has always been a dream of mine.

1121
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,340
Bieber said in a statement,

1122
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,140
I grew up on Tim Hortons.

1123
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,620
It's always been something close to my heart.

1124
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,660
Hope Bagozi, Chief Marketing Officer for Tim Hortons,

1125
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,340
said Bieber's genuine lifelong love of the brand

1126
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,260
made the collaboration authentic.

1127
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,980
Indeed, this threat for the Ontario-raised performer

1128
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,180
has shared posts as far back as a decade ago

1129
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,380
about missing Tim Hortons while traveling outside Canada.

1130
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,380
Justin is so fervent in how much he loves Tim's.

1131
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,260
Bagozi said in an interview,

1132
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,460
that is the perfect recipe for a collaboration.

1133
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,380
Oh.

1134
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,260
It's not forced.

1135
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,940
Hope Bagozi assures you, it's not forced.

1136
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,940
While hockey, Hope says, will always be part of our DNA.

1137
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,460
She said the celebrity partnership with Bieber

1138
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,220
will help reach new customers.

1139
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,340
It opens us up to a different audience

1140
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,980
and a different conversation beyond just hockey.

1141
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,060
It sounds like they're doing a bunch of damage control

1142
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,020
because Justin Bieber's last album was called

1143
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,180
Fuck Hockey and everyone who likes it.

1144
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,100
Justin has wide appeal,

1145
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,220
but definitely does appeal to younger guests.

1146
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,740
Nabbing Bieber is a major coup for the chain.

1147
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,140
The genesis of the collaboration

1148
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,900
can be traced back to 2019

1149
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,940
when the superstar waded into a heated debate

1150
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,780
about Tim Hortons lid redesign

1151
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,780
by launching a poll on his Instagram account.

1152
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,300
Now I'm going to read you this verbatim.

1153
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,820
This is Justin Bieber took some time out of his day

1154
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,060
to write this text.

1155
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,420
I know they could leak,

1156
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,260
but it was easier to drink out of.

1157
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,220
The coffee would come out better.

1158
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,060
These new lids are uncomfortable on the mouth.

1159
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,900
And you get.

1160
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,900
You guys remember when Justin Bieber

1161
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:53,300
let fucking Larry David take over his insta-frenate?

1162
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,860
You get very little liquid each drink.

1163
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,020
It's a damn outrage and it needs to be changed back.

1164
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,380
It's a damn outrage?

1165
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,780
Tibi H, Tibi H, it shouldn't be plastic.

1166
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,500
Find a way to be recyclable.

1167
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,660
Let's change the world one lid at a time.

1168
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,340
Bieber, I love you.

1169
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,860
That was the start of a conversation

1170
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,300
because he said he was quite keen to do something with us.

1171
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,300
So it's been almost two years in the making.

1172
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,620
To do donut hauls.

1173
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,260
Giving 10 bits are one of his favorite menu items.

1174
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,780
The idea of coming up with new flavors was a natural fit.

1175
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,780
He was super excited because that's his go-to item.

1176
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,260
Because, he said, we probably started out

1177
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,540
with about 100 possibilities.

1178
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,020
We would send him samples to try.

1179
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,660
And he was very specific on what he liked and didn't like.

1180
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,500
It was months in the making to land on these three flavors.

1181
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,860
I feel like I'm sensing a bit of frustration

1182
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,980
from Hope Bagozi.

1183
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,740
They look, I will say, delicious.

1184
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,780
What do the flavors count, Junior?

1185
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,580
Here it comes, are you ready?

1186
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,420
Yeah.

1187
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,180
You know what?

1188
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,860
I'm going to play the advertisement.

1189
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,860
Okay.

1190
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,500
Because I don't know if it's good or not,

1191
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,220
but I will play it and if it's bad, we'll cut it out.

1192
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,220
Does it seem- Sure, sure.

1193
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,740
Have a seat, we have some coffee for you.

1194
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,300
I'm just gonna take you through it.

1195
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,540
So, Justin, I know you've always loved Tim's.

1196
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,380
Obsessed.

1197
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,420
Which is why we're so excited to partner with you

1198
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,140
to create brand new Timbit flavors.

1199
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,220
Let's go. Let's go.

1200
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,620
Brainstorming, brainstorming.

1201
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,460
He's juggling Timbits.

1202
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,700
Can you imagine if we did a birthday cake waffle Timbit?

1203
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,820
Oh my, yes, yes.

1204
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,860
I can't even read my writing, it's so good.

1205
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,980
Think, think.

1206
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,820
Apple, banana.

1207
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,660
Apple.

1208
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,500
No.

1209
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,820
Thinking cap, put on the thinking cap.

1210
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,100
Apricot, latte.

1211
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,180
Yes. No, that's weird.

1212
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,500
Sorry. Think, Justin.

1213
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,540
Think. Yeah, get it out.

1214
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,740
Sour cream, chocolate chip.

1215
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,300
Yes, yes, yes.

1216
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,020
What if we do a chocolate white fudge?

1217
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,220
There it is.

1218
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,020
Yeah, now all we need is a name.

1219
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,060
Timbits by Justin Bieber.

1220
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,060
No, Justin Bieber's Timbits.

1221
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,300
I got it.

1222
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,660
Timbiebs.

1223
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,500
It's perfect.

1224
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,100
Introducing my new Timbiebs.

1225
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,780
Birthday cake waffle, sour cream, chocolate chip,

1226
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,140
and chocolate white fudge.

1227
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,060
Only at Tim's.

1228
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,620
This is my balls.

1229
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,100
If you eat my balls, I'm Timbiebs.

1230
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,100
I changed my name.

1231
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,900
These are better than me, so I'm changing my name to Timbiebs.

1232
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,340
That was a great commercial.

1233
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,660
I'm so excited about these three players.

1234
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,380
I'm excited to have my brother back.

1235
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,020
Yeah, I'm excited that Cat Donut walked into the sunlight.

1236
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,500
It brought me back, it revived me.

1237
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,900
He left, and he said, the last thing he said was,

1238
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,180
I've got to go play Fortnite.

1239
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,580
And then he flew out the window.

1240
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,420
Ah, what a cool youth.

1241
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,540
God, what a fucking cool dude.

1242
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,380
It's cool, yeah.

1243
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,220
I miss him, frankly.

1244
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,060
I'd rather it was still done.

1245
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,500
Exclusively in Canada and in the United States

1246
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,900
on November 29th.

1247
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,780
So like, I think I gotta get to Tim's, right?

1248
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,260
Like, I feel like I'm gonna have to get to Tim's.

1249
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,100
Yeah.

1250
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,180
They've got Tim's in Seattle?

1251
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,020
They got Tim's up there?

1252
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,620
Surely.

1253
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,020
Surely, right?

1254
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
It's not all Starbucks.

1255
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,460
Yeah, I would like that.

1256
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,620
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

1257
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,460
Yeah.

1258
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,100
We had such a fun time.

1259
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,420
I'm sorry that I used the whole second half of the show.

1260
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,260
It was a good one.

1261
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,260
I mean, it was a good one.

1262
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,100
It's fun.

1263
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,940
It's a fun one.

1264
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,380
It's exciting, and I'm so,

1265
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,980
guys, if you could see these motherfuckers,

1266
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,820
I'm so hungry.

1267
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,660
They do sound good.

1268
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,620
I love, I even love.

1269
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,780
I don't know that I've ever heard

1270
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,620
a donut hole described and thought like,

1271
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,780
that sounds like shit.

1272
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,980
Timbits, Timbits ready donut holes

1273
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,180
are like the perfect amount of donut, right?

1274
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,340
It's like, oh, just a little donut for me, thank you.

1275
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,420
Well, it's hard to throw a regular sized donut up

1276
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,460
in the air and catch it in your mouth.

1277
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,660
I can't believe we haven't talked about this before,

1278
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,820
but we're doing another virtual Candle Nights special.

1279
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,220
Did one last year, loved it so much.

1280
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:06,420
Doing it this year, December 18th, 9 p.m. Eastern time.

1289
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,060
We're gonna have segments from My Brother, My Brother, Me,

1290
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,540
Sawbones, Schmaners, Wonderful, Still Buffering, and Neat,

1291
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,420
as well as some amazing guests.

1292
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,300
And I don't know if I should spoil any of them,

1293
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,940
but they're really, really good.

1294
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,940
Trust me, we've outdone ourselves, but having cool friends.

1295
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,660
So check that out.

1296
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,820
That's a good way of saying

1297
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,580
the friends we had last year aren't-

1298
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:54,140
They were lame ducks compared to these cool friends.

1299
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,620

So go check that out.

1327
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,060
Yes.

1328
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,140
I think I will, Travis.

1329
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:06,980
Well, no, not you.

1330
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,460
We still have to finish the show, Justin.

1331
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,300
So like, don't do that.

1332
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,380
But we do want to thank Montaigne

1333
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,060
for our intro and outro music,

1334
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,980
My Life is Better with You, which is available now

1335
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,580
wherever good music is found.

1336
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,300
If you haven't watched the music video for that,

1337
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,260
it's on our YouTube too.

1338
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,740
And I think it's a very cute.

1339
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,660
I think it's a real cutie patootie of a music video,

1340
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,500
if you will.

1341
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,220
Now, Trav, Griffin had to step away

1342
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:36,340
for what I can only imagine is a bathroom emergency.

1343
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,580
But he did send me the text for his final Yahoo.

1344
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,420
So I'll just forward this to you.

1345
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,220
Oh, thank you.

1346
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,700
Yeah, you should see it there.

1347
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,300
Huh, why is it?

1348
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,980
That's weird.

1349
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,020
It's like in a Google doc, right?

1350
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,380
But like the handwriting is smudged somehow.

1351
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,100
Yeah, that's weird.

1352
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,220
You can't make it out?

1353
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,260
Let me see.

1354
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,100
Let me see if I can.

1355
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,100
Okay, okay.

1356
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,460
Let me see what is written here.

1357
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,300
Okay.

1358
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,140
Just read the, it's still very legible.

1359
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,100
Okay.

1360
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,020
Maybe your screen is smudged.

1361
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,420
Might be.

1362
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,620
Okay, this is sent to us by Punxsutawney Phil.

1363
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,860
The, sorry, the-

1364
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,340
It doesn't say.

1365
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,660
Okay, so it could be any Phil.

1366
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,980
It could be any, yeah.

1367
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,140
I mean, I think we're led to believe,

1368
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,140
but it could be sent to us by Punxsutawney Phil,

1369
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:34,140
but it's written, it's written by-

1370
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,940
Go on.

1371
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,660
It's written by Michelangelo.

1372
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,260
Sorry, art or turtle?

1373
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,100
It's written by Michelangelo here.

1374
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,980
Art or turtle?

1375
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,940
I don't see a difference between those two, frankly.

1376
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,620
Because martial arts is an art

1377
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,700
when you think about it, Justin.

1378
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,940
Fair, yes.

1379
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,040
It says here, aw, ding, dang it.

1380
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,460
I done went and got pizza inside my shell again.

1381
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,060
And that's going to make it hard for me

1382
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,140
to paint the Sistine Chapel.
