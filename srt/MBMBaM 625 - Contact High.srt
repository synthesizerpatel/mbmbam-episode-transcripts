1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:10,260
It's better with you

9
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,100
Hello welcome my brother my brother me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,140
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. Hey, what's up? So guys this morning? I was at the gym

11
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
you know the the Iron Temple and

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,780
I got a message from our

13
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,800
Well the executive producer, I mean the producers all got together, but from mr. Jarmuson and

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,700
They just sent over some studio. What was the name? Mr. Jarmuson

15
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,060
Jarmuson did you say? Yeah, there's not as many vowels in it as you'd think and

16
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,780
Mr. Jarmuson asked me to just go over these with you real quick

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,140
So I figured we always have a little time in the intro where we don't really say anything funny

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,740
So I just go ahead and get these out of the way here. Okay. Yeah. All right

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,260
Uh Griffin right off the bat and they said that this is mostly a legal thing

20
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,500
Yeah, now that you live in DC

21
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,660
They've asked you to stop saying that you have a Texas size hunger for things. Oh, man

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,580
You can't do that anymore but I mean that my hunger

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,460
Was established in Texas like I yeah, have you seen the bowls of chili that they serve there?

24
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,060
It's it's it's fucking wild and they're just worried that at this point it'll be like a legal issue with the state of Texas

25
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,580
But if I go back to eating these very small trendy

26
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,520
metropolitan bowls of chili

27
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,300
Then with all their various beans in it, like it's not gonna it's not gonna fill me up

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,820
They made a suggestion. They said that you could say a honking big hunger

29
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,300
Okay, I like that better actually. Yeah. Okay

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,980
This is why these produce a lot of people these things down. I think it's good stuff

31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,580
It's good to get an outside perspective. All right, Justin. They said they they're loving your characters, obviously

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,060
Big hit in the studio. They said the lore isn't complicated enough. Oh, you could yeah if you could develop a little bit more

33
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,180
I have actually been deeming my own Taz arc people don't realize Oh within within my brother my brother

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,860
Oh, it's a little ARG. It's a rich tapestry

35
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,580
They said to me. Oh god, damn it still not interrupting enough and I don't know how much more. Yeah

36
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
I hate interrupting

37
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,300
Yeah, and you don't woman it this is what's fucked up to when we don't record. Yeah

38
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,420
Travis is

39
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,340
Very patient. Yeah, and always waits till someone finishes their thought and then he gives it like five seconds of sign

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,300
Talking to Travis is interesting because then he'll be silent for like five seconds as he's like, let me think on that before I respond

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,380
But but they don't like that for the show. They said a lot of dead air that they're worried about

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,620
So you can just always cut that out though. Well, they said we need to spend less money on editing

43
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,780
So we got to leave a lot more in that was another thing on here

44
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,060
They still want Rachel to do the same amount of work, but not editing. They don't understand

45
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:17,100
They said put more in to edit out. I don't I don't follow that one so much. Uh, let's see here. They said oh more

46
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,780
About our advertisers operating in defiance of God. They really like that

47
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,500
That was a hit that was a big hit they said both with advertisers and

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,900
Our demographic of seven to twenty-eight. It really hit big

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Seven year olds hate

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,860
God. Yeah, that's so you also read that that one doesn't seem to be a no

51
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,500
It's just scrolled across the top of the email

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,620
Okay

53
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,780
They also said you're not enough stunts

54
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,380
Okay, how would we do that in an audio form? Yeah

55
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,940
I tried to explain that to him and they said that's the best part because we could basically do we could say

56
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,260
We're doing a stunt. I mean we are recording. We do see each other on video now

57
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,300
Yeah, fairly recently, you know, which you know, which I think is so interesting that you do know you do know that

58
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah, cuz you're watching it right now. Oh me. Yeah

59
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Yeah, no, they're supposed to be watching the video. I

60
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,700
Always do cuz I want I want to see the jokes come out

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,740
So Griffin if you could just do a stunt now

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,900
I got a foam roller back there. Should I just pop my back real quick? Yeah, I think that yeah

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
I think for us that's a stunt

64
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay

65
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,220
That's a thinner foam roller than I would and that's on his butt is that whoa

66
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,700
Well, he's like well he's going off-screen now, but it's like a neo it's like a neo matrix thing

67
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,580
He's dodging those see if you guys could see him

68
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,740
It looks like he's being bullied by an imaginary eighth grader. Yeah, like making him lie on the ground

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,540
It kind of looked like he was being bullied by an imaginary eighth grader who was shoving him over a smaller imaginary eighth grader

70
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,740
Who had kneeled down behind him? So fucking good though. I am an inch taller

71
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,660
More stunts. They also said we hadn't done enough to incorporate the Chrissy wake up

72
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,980
Like remix song that they did from tick-tock. They said tick-tock integration in general hasn't

73
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,900
We could reference the kid who likes corn

74
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm Chrissy wake up. I don't the boy who's very upset by this table and is it being and it being broken?

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,200
Well, they said they just wrote here tick-tock equals timeless

76
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,900
Apparently

77
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,500
Counterintuitive, but okay, apparently the more we reference the more timeless it will make our show. Can I give the producers a note?

78
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Yeah, okay

79
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Running running a little long

80
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Producers

81
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, then I don't think it's fair that this should just go one way

82
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,540
I just want them to know that it's the one last thing just as far as tick-tock integration goes

83
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,100
They missed the bit where we developed our own tick-tock sound where we each said one thing and then people

84
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,580
Sound to use it. So they wanted not being a huge success. Well, but it was critically for the producers

85
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,820
Like within the producer community and I don't just mean ours

86
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,820
So apparently they got together with the other producers and talked about they loved it. That's fast

87
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,620
So Griffin you go first and then Justin sure sure sure. Oh

88
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,540
My style I guess you could say

89
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Now keep it going keep it going Justin I

90
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:45,020
I can't top Griffin's. This is so vibrant. It's full of life. That is true

91
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:54,020
Griffin you want to give us another run at it? Yeah, sure. Hey everybody. It's the summertime and you know what that means. Oh

92
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Yeah

93
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:07,500
You guys remember spongebob squarepants, yeah, that was the don't interrupt the tick-tocks out. Oh, sorry

94
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,820
You guys remember a little show called spongebob squarepants? Well, here's a visual joke about that. Don't I look like one of the characters right now?

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,540
Okay, I want to try one I want to try one. All right. Hey, baby, what's going on?

96
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,340
You want to come over to my house and check out this closet full of monkeys?

97
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,340
And so I figured that could but it will be it'll seem like it's a first trap monkeys. Maybe it's stuffies

98
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,980
How about that? How about like? Oh, yeah. Am I a real gamer? Just check out these stuffies. Yeah, that's good

99
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,660
How about that? Like what are you? Uh, do I like Pokemon? Yeah, I guess you could say

100
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,700
I like it a little bit and then there's like a

101
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,500
Grand reveal of all there. Oh, yeah. Yeah right over it

102
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,460
How about like Gundam more like fun dumb? Okay, that one's good. That was a good sound. Yeah

103
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah, okay, Justin. You need to really hit it on one hit it hit us with a six

104
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,980
I think me and Travis have both crushed it on at least one. Yeah, I just haven't okay. Oh

105
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,380
Do something about ghosts people love that shit

106
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Okay here, okay

107
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,500
One of the regular players on whose lines in any way. Yeah, I guess you could say I am and then

108
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,460
And then that tik-tok sound could only be used by like Colin Mochrie. I don't know. Yeah, right

109
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
All the gang

110
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:36,780
Can you give us something like oh, that's a ghost something like that or it's just like something where it's just like the ghost revealed

111
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm gonna do a really genetic. Okay. This is like yeah generic is better. Yeah generic people can use that people can use that that's

112
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,620
That's not how you do that wait no no stop that's not how any of this works

113
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,940
Please stop far enough stop it

114
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
You're killing him

115
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,980
Now I did notice Justin that was great I love that got less and less generic towards the end there that's the build

116
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,700
Oh, okay. God. I love that. I love that. Okay. Well, we'll let that percolate for like a week

117
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,260
I'll let that go viral now Justin the producers also said that they think you had a

118
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,740
Tell you said that was the last producer bit. No now. I'm the producer. I was okay now. Okay good

119
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,180
It's so tough when we're doing bits. You know it was that a bit. It's so tough. Well, it's just like high performance

120
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,700
You know what I mean? It's like it's so tough when we're doing it

121
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, I had to have some pre-workout just to get through it. You know what I mean? It's got out in a minute

122
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,320
Oh, it makes my skin tingle, which isn't normal. I don't think that's fantastic. That's great Trav

123
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,740
so right, so I just wanted to like

124
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,460
Say say this story that I wanted to tell you okay, I love when people preface the story like

125
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
Okay, so

126
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,820
This is a little long, but hang with so dad texted me a little bit ago

127
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,660
A few few few few days and said hey he sent us all this picture of like weird out coming to the Paramount

128
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,940
Art Center, which is a beautiful venue. It's in Ashland, Kentucky about 1,400 seats if I had to guess

129
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,980
But which is smaller than weird. I would normally play so I was thrilled right he's yeah

130
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,940
I've been to the Paramount Art Center before so I'm like okay definitely gonna go I look on line

131
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,660
It's like basically sold out. There's two shit left

132
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,500
Maybe from for me and Charlie Charlie did raise the point like weird

133
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,060
I was on your TV shit you guys are friends. I'm sure well you to buy a ticket

134
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,020
I like that those two things one of them's true and one of them's not it's like a door in the labyrinth up

135
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:47,020
He wasn't our TV show he why do you have to buy tickets daddy? You know weird Al and it's like well, honey

136
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,660
Weird Al did appear on our television program

137
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,940
But we don't text fun, so I just bought the tickets cuz I want to support out

138
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,460
I've been a weird Al fan is like the first

139
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,920
Guy I liked right there got me into him and in you know my middle school years and here we are so

140
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Show up to the concert

Emo Phillips is opening are you kidding?

142
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,280
Me I'm just gonna treat myself to a little emo who was

143
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
Far too funny hysterical

144
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,700
so then I'm looking around this place is packed and it's packed with like a

145
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,380
few people I could tell her like deep in the paint and then a few other people who are like remember weird Al and

146
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,340
Maybe or maybe they're like season ticket holders, and they're just like there right cuz Paramount Arts Center. It's part of a series

147
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
Weird Al comes out and

148
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,840
He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Whoa

149
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,860
Um yeah, I know so weird Al comes out, and he says I don't know if you all know

150
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,600
But this tour we are only playing unpopular songs

151
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Yeah, audience bursts into laughter. Oh

152
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,160
Al you cut up. I can't believe

153
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,520
No

154
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,760
He's serious. I love this tour is

155
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,600
Is no pokas no parodies

156
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,560
Just deep cut

157
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,600
originals

158
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,880
Then he is just playing with his I would have loved that show so this man is playing this legend

159
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
This icon is playing

160
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,440
His heart out to a by design by the way none of this is unintended

161
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,000
The by this man is playing his heart out to a room full of septuagenarians

162
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,000
Who could not give less of a shit stone-faced?

163
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,880
Nothing from them it is a room full of people that are so disappointed that he's not gonna play beat it and

164
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
one thick King who

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Feasting

166
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Closest friends are

167
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Troubling it up. Are you really you drop the theme song to UHF on me?

168
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,680
Why can't really you're gonna give me you're gonna give me a

169
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,560
Skipper Dan the song about the guy who's it on the jungle cruise you're doing your out your rage against the machine

170
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Total pastiche, I'll sue ya. Thank you my liege bless us

171
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,640
Sorry, sorry, it's this a extremely protracted harpsichord solo

172
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Really for me what a gift

173
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:41,120
Can you from room of LTR is gonna stand up there for me Justin McElroy and do a harpsichord solo?

174
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,880
What a blessing thank you my liege bless bless us more and what's the important thing? I think that I don't lose sight of

175
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:56,680
No one gets up. Yeah, no one leaves. Yeah, even when he plays did he does one song?

176
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,960
That's not an original deep cut. I shit you not it is all right now by free

177
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
What okay?

178
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,400
He says I want to do one cover is all right now. Come on. Are you are you with or kidding?

179
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,080
No one left cuz it's a fucking great band and a great songwriter with a lovely tapestry

180
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,360
My man closes my man closes this show

181
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
with Albuquerque

182
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,360
God that is designed to irritate me

183
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,640
That is a this is a song where the joke in the song one of the jokes of the song is I forgot where I was

184
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,600
And I'm going to start over in the song and it's designed to irritate people. That's the closer

185
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,240
Amazing. Thank you out. I guess I just wanted to say thank you Al right like thank you Al

186
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Thank you. Thank you

187
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
And you're welcome to everybody in there who got to go out to the boneyard with me

188
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,160
My fucking middle school years of listening to the entire album. Yeah, finally paying off. Thank you for this blessing my leash

189
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
I do appreciate it

190
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,000
The thing I love most about this and there's so much to love about it

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,360
Is that he also has the biopic coming out starting dinner a club

192
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,220
He is about to and this is saying quite a bit. I think be the most like

193
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,700
Mainstream well-known he's ever been and he was like, you know what I'm gonna do

194
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,180
He said at one point he said I don't know if you heard but I have a biopic coming out

195
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,100
Which is wild and I and we wrote a new song for it, which I would love to play for you here

196
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,420
So everyone at that point is like, yes. Yes. Yes. Give it to us King. Thank you some new

197
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,260
material

198
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,380
fantastic

199
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:42,100
They count it off two three four and then the song stops the lights come up and he says but we can't

200
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,220
The lawyers would get really upset about it

201
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,300
Yes, yeah, he ain't convinced it right out of right and then that's what he said

202
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,860
I have the theme song to my last movie and I'll play that and he played UHF. Fantastic. I love

203
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,340
Sir it was a it was such a great show. What a talent

204
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,900
I

205
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,600
I'm sure if he had known I was there. Yeah, he would have given a little and if he and known who I was

206
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,380
And he would have brought you up you think and remember if he had remembered that he had been on our show

207
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,940
If he had interacted with you in the show anyway, I'm sure he would have liked

208
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Justin get up here

209
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,300
Let me be your hog man get up here you don't love me anymore get up here

210
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,700
He did one more minute. Are you kidding me? Wow, one more minute. What a show

211
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,380
Oh, I didn't even tell you the wildest part before Albuquerque his 13-minute closer

212
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,660
My man does like an eight-minute doors

213
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,220
tonal pastiche called Craigslist that has like a

214
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,900
Three-minute long psychedelic freak out. We're just watching a bunch of 60 year old men on stage

215
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Cranking out a Doris fantasy

216
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,660
Loving it for the ride. Yeah, baby. Yes, Charlie who is a

217
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,900
Something of a weird out fan what her favorite song in the whole show was cuz she didn't know

218
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,020
Any of them and she said my favorite song was the song where they did the flower colored lights

219
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,580
That they were shining around the doors. Okay, that was for the kids

220
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,360
That was the highlight for the kids is we had some colorful lighting

221
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,520
Fantastic. We can see this show it is outrageous. You will you will have such a good time. Anyway, that's my plug

222
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,120
for we hold on I have to tell you the name of the tour of

223
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,680
this of this particular tour is the

224
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,600
Unfortunate return of the ridiculously self-indulgent ill-advised vanity to her that's good. That's my dream. I that's my dream

225
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,080
I hope to one day get up and just do unpopular bits. Oh, yes. We've got a couple of those remember the Detroit

226
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:04,240
Yeah, but what if we could pay a bunch of thirsty noobs just drink up lap up our our our

227
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,600
Bonus material. Okay. So this is an advice show. Obviously so advice go see weird Al on this tour. It's fantastic

228
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,640
Fantastic. So if you can get tickets, yeah, good luck. Yeah, the next piece of advice is coming right now

229
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,640
I love car washes specifically the automatic ones that have all the colored lights and bubbles

230
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,120
I've always liked them now. I'm living in the city and I don't need a car

231
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,400
So I haven't been through one. Is it weird to call an uber and ask them to go through the car wash?

232
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,800
I would pay for it. So it seems like a win-win

233
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,120
That's from car wash conundrum in New York City and I need us. I need a second

234
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah, here's what's fascinating to me, right? Because this question is maybe one of the most clear examples of the question

235
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,960
Is it weird having a couple different connotations, right? Is it right out of the ordinary? Yes

236
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,640
Yes, obviously if it wasn't that would not be writing this you wouldn't you knew you knew that going in

237
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,760
I don't think that the average uber slash Lyft writer writer

238
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,280
Has done this. Is it weird to the point where the driver would say?

239
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,560
No, I don't think so. I think if you could chain it together with something else, right?

240
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,520
You can't just put car washes your destination because then right drop you off at the car wash

241
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,400
It has to be like oh, let me add a stop real quick the car wash now

242
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,840
You do need to say something ahead of time or else it's going to sound like a nasty dig

243
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Oh

244
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,040
Quick because your whip is so dusty. It looks like it looks like it just climbed out of a mummy tomb

245
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,080
That's gonna be insulting

246
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,800
But if you get in the car and you're like, hey

247
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,760
I know that I put Trader Joe's in here as my destination

248
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,000
but I do want you to know that you have won the contest the

249
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,480
Prize is a free car wash on me and we'll go to one that's really far away

250
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,600
So we'll run that fare. Yeah all the way to fuck up and this is just for you

251
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,680
I don't think your car is very dirty. I decided I was gonna do this before I saw your car

252
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,040
But I'll even get a rain. You have no judgment. Is there another way that you can fulfill this?

253
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
dark urge other than

254
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,760
Ridesharing I mean the only other way I could think of is to go to an automatic car wash and then wait

255
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,960
So you see someone get in line for it? And then you're like, hey, is that cool if I hop in? I love this shit

256
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,840
This is my favorite thing and I'm not gonna I have no knife. I know

257
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,760
This rush album that I need you to crank up and let's lean the seatbacks open up that sunroof and let's enjoy that

258
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,240
Well, don't open it up

259
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,760
Obviously that would create a whole mess of problems

260
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
Hey

261
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
No, all right

262
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
CLN

263
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
RYD

264
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,440
clean ride

265
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,920
This is your app. Oh, this is your dream. Oh disruption future. This is your destiny. It's like uber

266
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
but instead of coming to pick you up I

267
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,560
Come to your house and I take your car through the car wash for you. I bring it back

268
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,920
You didn't have to do anything. You call a ride. I'll be at your house

269
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,840
I'll take your car. I'll wash your car for you. I'll bring it back. You pay me now Justin. Here's my worry

270
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,720
This is there's no worry. It's actually this is a really good idea. Yeah good for our show

271
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,080
clean ride

272
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,840
I'm worried about publishing this and someone drinking our milkshake on it because this is a good

273
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,880
App that could really disrupt it. This show is not about money Travis. What is as our as our as our

274
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,240
Several minutes of promotional materials at the end of every episode will attest we don't care about money

275
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,320
No care about ideas. Yeah and furthering the human experiment and that's what we're achieving with clean ride

276
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,920
You're like the Socrates of podcasts. You could be at a position where you've given us all your personal information

277
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,440
Yeah, hey this you've bought like we call them we call them ride bucks

278
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,940
I don't want you to just pay in the app. You have to buy ride bucks and you can buy them at like any Duncan

279
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
in

280
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,180
Okay, we don't want Apple to take a cut right crypto no, you can't use crypto

281
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,620
We don't want Apple to take a cut. So it's a different phone from your regular phone. Oh, wait, so you okay

282
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,640
So you buy a phone loaded with ride bugs?

283
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,620
You remember like cricket cricket wireless like I don't think they're still around but they probably do have a bunch of phones

284
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,940
so we'll use those and those are now clean ride or

285
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,740
soapy boys

286
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,380
Clean ride feels a little antiseptic to me. I'm worried that it's not going to engender trust in people

287
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,540
But soapy boy soapy boy, like let me call my soapy boy

288
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
and whip washers

289
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Soapy boys better

290
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,780
Boys, I feel like it's a gendered thing Griffin that's gonna get in the way where whip washers. That's the universe

291
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,840
That's a that's too hip though. Only the Gen Z people will know what a whip is

292
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,060
Let's maybe clean ride, let's see how that sticks

293
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,860
So we'll go you go to a Duncan or a BP and you get a clean ride phone

294
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,020
That yeah, and you can't know listen, you'll just use it doesn't make calls

295
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:29,460
You can't use it to summon clean ride, but you can recharge it. Oh, it's really new more ride bucks

296
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:39,180
three times, three times. Can I jailbreak it and get some emulators going or what's up. You can but be careful because it does not have

297
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,540
At this iteration. Yeah, it does not have charging capabilities on the on the on the so when you say recharge it

298
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
You mean reload it with money not

299
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,020
Well, they have those special European outlets at Duncan's and that's what you need

300
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:01,060
So wait, is there a tie-in with Duncan here? I'm confused. I'm just picking something that there's a lot of right we could do

301
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
Duncan we could do

302
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Bank

303
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,140
Orange Julius the bank anywhere that you might see a Tesla charger fire state fire house fire

304
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,980
Houses anywhere people go a lot to shop or or commute. Yeah, whatever

305
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,420
Part so that's your business. That's like a free business idea from from from me to you

306
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,620
You can just do whatever you want with that. No problem

307
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,580
That was close because that was almost a good business idea, but we ruined it. So yeah

308
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,020
So I have a wizard that with a wizard sim sent me this well Lucia sent me this one

309
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,780
It's a wizard wisdom and I would love to read it all to you. It is from the wiki house service

310
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
it's from dating coach

311
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Imad Jabara and

312
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,220
It is what does stink mean in a relationship?

313
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,380
Did your partner call you stink and now you're scratching your head trying to make some sense of it

314
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,660
It's reasonable if you're a little lost on this one stink isn't a super popular nickname

315
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,500
So it's fair that you'd be looking for help here. That's where we come in

316
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,300
well, you started like an ironic thing like calling a big guy tiny or

317
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,380
Calling a clean person sticky. I mean we'll get to that

318
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,220
Um, that's where we come in in this article. We're gonna break down what this means

319
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,840
We'll also cover all the other ways someone might use stink in a convo

320
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,060
So, you know each and every way this word can be used. Okay, but it is just stink

321
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,280
That form of the word is just a noun, right?

322
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,460
It's also a verb. It's both things you stink. Okay. Yeah, I guess so

323
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,660
What does it mean if your partner calls you stink in a relationship? Your stink is like your boo

324
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,740
This isn't a very common phrase, but if your partner calls you their stink

325
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,100
It's sort of a sweet nickname like babe love or sweetheart

326
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,020
There's a slight hint of teasing with stink that isn't there with other nicknames

327
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,220
But it's almost always meant in good fun. For example, your partner might say, you know, you're my main stink, right?

328
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,760
I could never love anyone. Oh my god. Yes. This is Melissa. She's my stink

329
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,980
Hey stink, you want to cuddle and watch a movie tonight?

330
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,860
I use stink the same way you'd use any playful pet name if you want to use stink as a nickname

331
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,580
You'd use it the same we use any cute flirty name for your partner

332
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,100
Just keep in mind

333
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,220
This isn't a crazy popular slang term and your partner may not take it the right way if they've never heard it use this way

334
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,860
Before you might say hey there stink. What's going on? You're my favorite lovebug my cute little stink

335
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Stink want to order a pizza tonight?

336
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:37,780
Hey stink stink it's it's used that way out of context even in a

337
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,620
Obscure context where I feel like it borders on the insult now

338
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,700
I looked it up on Urban Dictionary because about 18 times this article has already said that it's not a common thing

339
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,140
And I'm like, is it common in the way that it's zero and I looked it up

340
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:58,220
But now here's where it could get confusing. Okay on Urban Dictionary says it's an affectionate name for a close friend or relative

341
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,340
Wow, so you two are my strengths, right?

342
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,540
So if I said this is my stink Melissa Melissa might be like I thought we were more closer

343
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,980
I thought we were more than stink. I thought we were are we just sink to you Derek?

344
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:19,400
Because Derek we've been intimate this next tip sucks. Ask your partner what they mean if you aren't sure well, no

345
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,180
That's not that's a real purpose though

346
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,620
I would say I would love to avoid if someone said you stink and I said like I love you, too

347
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,540
And they're like no you stink like shit, right? That would be I would like to avoid that

348
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,500
That's a good rule for all relationships

349
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,580
If you don't understand what the person that you are in a relationship with is saying

350
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,340
It's really important that you not ask them yet to clarify or expound on it because well, this is an article

351
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,380
That's like roof. Well, I'm sorry Griffin. I'm I've been married for a really long time

352
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
So I'm kind of giving out some gold

353
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:55,060
You do ever ask your partner to clarify their feelings or like explain how they're feeling or ask any questions

354
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,660
Then you're that's like a sign that you're not communicating. Well, so you're

355
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,000
If you just understand it if you just understand it without asking or pretend you understand

356
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,320
Right, you understand it to save the relationship. That's most of a good relationship is pretending right? We can all agree you pretend

357
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,580
Constantly, I don't think this is good advice. You don't think so

358
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,040
Like if your partner says you stink, you know, like I love hey guys. I don't love that. But I'm hey guys. Yeah

359
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,280
It's stink normally refers to a bad odor. Oh

360
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,680
Okay. All right. A lot of this is really stuck. Okay, it's opened up now. Yeah

361
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,600
Yeah, now I get up a stink might also refer to a tantrum or outburst if someone's raising a stink or causing a stink

362
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
It means they're making a lot of noise

363
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,400
Giving someone I was gonna refuse that until you gave the examples where I was like, I've never heard someone say

364
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,760
Well, they're really throwing a stink over there. Yeah now I do want to start saying that

365
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,120
This it's trying to become more grounded this article here toward the back half

366
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Except for this next part giving someone a stink might refer to an attitude or a mean look ever hear of the stink

367
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,160
I it's a term for the look someone does when they're annoyed and want you to stop whatever you're doing

368
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,160
You first of all a very serious illness that we don't talk enough about frankly like we talk a lot about pink

369
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,720
I but not enough about stink. I same cause but one smells pretty bad some folks abbreviate that to stink

370
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,040
No one does that. No, are you mad at me for something? You were giving me the stink from across the room. Oh my

371
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,080
That is a good way to defuse an argument though, cuz you're gonna say that they're gonna be like wait, hold on all that aside

372
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,380
What what did you just say? No, no, I know. Yeah. Yeah, you know, did you just say I was giving you?

373
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,560
Give me the stink and then last tip is says some shit about pheromones, but I think the most important thing is that

374
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,760
We all need to be using this word a lot more because it's very powerful

375
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,280
Stink is such a great word. Like I wish I'd been there the first time that someone smelled bad and somebody's like this

376
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Stinks and everyone would look at them like yes. Yes. That's the word. I know exactly what you mean by that

377
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,760
I know what you mean by that. Do not define it. Do not explain it. I will know our relationship is in trouble

378
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,880
But then some woman looks at her husband is like I don't that's what we use. That's the word we use

379
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:23,760
We can use it for both, people will get it. People will understand. If you'd been there, you could have been you could have sprinted home and been like, honey, stink

380
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:32,760
You'd be like what? No, I heard it today. It's a great word. Does it mean something smells bad? Yes. Yeah, right? Stink

381
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,760
The same guy also said puke. That's like when the stuff comes out of your mouth. Yeah, exactly

382
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,760
You got it. The wet mouth poop. Yes. Yes

383
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,760
It's puke now. I love that. We're going with puke

384
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I love this Victorian garbage pail kid that you guys have. Yeah, I've been calling it vomit. No, no, no too clinical. We're going with puke

385
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:05,760
No, no, no, no, no, not dick glue. Jizz. That's fun. And I can use these Z's and Scrabble finally

386
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I was gonna go with cum, but that sounds like it could get so confusing so often that I don't even know why we decided to even flirt with that idea

387
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Well, a sixth grader suggested it because they wanted to giggle in class. Yeah, all the time

388
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,760
But I think jizz. No one's gonna use jizz. Hey, it's me George Lucas. Damn it. Damn it

389
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Okay, how about another question brothers? Is it time for questions? No, God, we've been recording for so long

390
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,760
We gotta stop the fun to do other different fun and take a trip to the money zone

391
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Hooray!

392
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Honey? Yeah? Stink? Yes. Okay, thank you. I want to tell you about honey. Listen, I'm not gonna joke. There's no jokes here

393
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
I'm not gonna joke. I'm gonna be very serious

394
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:12,760
I'm gonna use my big boy serious voice to tell you that today's episode is sponsored by honey the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer

395
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,760
You guys know about this? You hear about this? Hey, you hear about this in the news? You put honey on your computer

396
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Now I know what you're thinking. Pour honey on my computer? No, you silly billy goat. I said no jokes

397
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Honey is something you download onto your computer or phone. Don't pour honey on your phone

398
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Take it from me. It's a mistake

399
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,760
It's a free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your online cart

400
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
What do you guys think? Sound good to you?

401
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Why are you asking? Yes, why are you asking? Of course it's good

402
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Well, I was just trying to get you guys engaged. I'm doing all the work over here

403
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Just do the ad Travis

The honey button appears. Faster! The honey button appears and all you have to do is click apply coupons and watch prices drop

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,760

408
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,760
I know you're wondering when I click the honey button doesn't it make my finger sticky and my answer is stop being such a fucking prude

409
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Like live a little try some try some new stuff out

410
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Now Griffin you love honey you used honey to buy your weird paraphernalia for your body in your home, right?

411
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Yeah, I think I actually used it to buy my foam roller that I just used earlier

412
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I got a sick fucking deal on it. Hell yeah dude

413
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,760
And I got a skateboard that I bought with it

414
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Yeah, I bought a skateboard and honey got me a bunch of money off it

415
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,760
And then I got I didn't you know what I didn't buy though a helmet because I never crash

416
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Whoa, alright. Oh wow. Yeah

417
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:02,760
If you don't already have honey. So I've been sketching on buses and I sketched a bus all the way to the White House and then

418
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,760
And then you went on a date with the president's daughter. I went on a date with the president

419
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Thanks to honey I got a discount skateboard I sketched all the way to the White House and then I

420
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Can I say I fucked Joe Biden?

421
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
There's a lot of people who seem to want to

422
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah

423
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,760
A lot of people say that and they say and but I don't think they mean it in a good way

424
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,760
God coming to theater, Griffin let's make a movie called My Date With Joe

425
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
It's just like you and Joe on a completely platonic just like living in a

426
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Well assumed platonic I do think there needs to be a conversation at some point where the sparks start flying and it's like

427
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
What are we? Are we stank?

428
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Is this stank? Hey is this stank? I've never experienced stank before is this stank? Is this stank?

429
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
What am I stank?

430
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,760
So if you don't already have honey you could be straight up missing out and by getting it you'll be doing yourself a solid

434
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Gross

435
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,760
What is this Paul Revere Times?

436
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,760
And I went and I was like where are the stamps? Where are the stamps? We just moved did we pack up stamps?

437
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:30,760
And then it turns out that we did and so I got them out of where we had kept them and I put it on the letter and I sent it off

438
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,760
But for a minute there I thought we didn't have stamps and I was confronted with this possibility I would have to go to the post office

439
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Relatable hashtag relatable

440
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,760
You don't need to say that

Give me another question J-Man. Oh, unless you have one of your classic bits here

474
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Here comes a classic Justin bit. I had a classic I had a classic story next next week

475
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I think we will finally be I've been on pins and needles over here on PSL watch and I do it just as a public service as of

476
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,760
August 25th the end of nominee 2022. There is no pumpkin spice date yet

477
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Yeah, it could be any minute though. I mean Mike I'm refreshing this page because that'll be a huge event

478
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,760
But we're not there yet. So let's just do questions. I recently started a new job as a vet tech things are going well

479
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Or so I thought this morning. I brought in a beautiful homemade peach pie to share with my co-workers and no one had any

480
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I told people I made it to share and I took the first piece. Okay, that's one. Yes

481
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:09,760
You did the exact right first thing to indicate that it's open for business have to yeah. Otherwise people assume it's a gift

482
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,760
No one even picked at the perfectly flaky crust what never being faced with leftovers before

483
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,760
I left my almost full pie dish and serving knife there in the break room. I have the next two days off

484
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Do I go back for my pie? Do I wait and hope someone mercifully tosses it while I'm gone?

485
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Should I put in my can't wait yet to go back to work?

486
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Can I put two weeks because I never felt such rejection and don't know how to recover

487
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,760
That's from peach perplexed and Peoria. This is a fucking good question. This this is a good one. I like don't quit over there

488
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Don't wait in this economy. There's a that's there's never been a better time to quit so that that is actually bad. Oh, okay

489
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,760
First of all, let's just say vet tech is it a very important job obviously, but it's not as like

490
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Like cyberpunk as it sounds which is unfortunate

491
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Like you're not making a lot of dogs when I hear vet tech like I want someone to put like a you know a hacker deck

492
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Inside of my cat's forearm or something. Yeah, obviously

493
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,760
So that's a that is disappointing to me from this from the start Mike. I guess my next question is a peach pie

494
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
is

495
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Is a gooey a lot it can be a lot of work

496
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:38,760
So did you priest did you pre slice the slices because that's a big issue for me of like am I gonna slice is a really

497
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Small piece and people look at me and be like what's wrong with your small piece of pie?

498
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,760
I bet you have a small wiener to something like that or if you make a slice of pie

499
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
They're like I for a big wiener boy

500
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Yeah, save some for the fish and I'm like I

501
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:04,760
I did you have plastic cutlery or real cutlery and like plates set out like you need to remove every barrier between

502
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Your co-workers and having pie in their mouths

503
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,760
You're 100 the ideal for a pie if you're bringing in a sharer a pie is a rough one a pie is real rough

504
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,760
I mean even a cake cookies are an obvious one

505
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Tiny pies

506
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,760
But like it's really hard with a pie because there's a lot going on first off in its ideal

507
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Design a pie feeds eight

508
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Right. You could tell me it depends on how big no no no no as designed

509
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,760
The perfect pie slice is one eighth of the pie, right pie is actually stands for a it's a it's like Greek

510
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,760
It's the Greek number for pie. Nobody's gonna nobody wants to be the first like you took a slice out

511
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,760
That's huge. Perfect, but it's really hard if you just see a pie there and it's like are there plates?

512
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,760
I'm looking around are there plates are there forks is it sliced?

513
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I mean, I think in a future scenario you can help yourself by being like, hey, can I cut you a slice?

514
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Oh, that's nice. A little thirsty maybe a little yeah

515
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,760
But especially if you're new there is also I will say this if you bring in baked good from home

516
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,760
There's a chance that it is not good. No, I'm not saying yours is yours is yours is good

517
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
But you're saying that that home baked goods right hand

518
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Be gross. And so I think you do need to be a little thirsty to get the ball rolling now

519
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I will also say this question asker you didn't ask this

520
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,760
But as someone who likes to bake and would often bring baked goods in when I worked at the theater

521
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,760
You do need to be careful because if it's good

522
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,760
Now it's good and you do it like twice. I think you set a precedent of them being like

523
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Are you gonna bring in another pie? When are we gonna get some more of that pie?

524
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Huh? Do you do cake too? Oh, I'd love and it's gonna be a thing of like

525
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I miss when you used to bring in pot and it's just like that was one time five years ago

526
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,760
And you could get like an added eventually people start to make you into a character

527
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I've had this of like, oh

528
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,760
He's a fantastic bake Justin's a fantastic baker. Where do you try these and I'm like, no, they're garbage actually

529
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I hate you. Yeah, I hate these I get a shit job on me

530
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,760
These are shit made in a crust and they made him wear a big white

531
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,760
Chef hat at the office and speak with a French speak French accent and French words

532
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,760
And he wasn't good at that part of it. And so Justin stopped baking

533
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Entirely because they wanted him to they said be the ghost from ratatouille and

534
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
And Justin was like, I don't want to be the ghost from ratatouille

535
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
No, I mean Gusteau. Next time, next time here's what you do

536
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,760
You make some of my world-famous caramel snack mix and nobody if anybody wraps their lips right

537
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,760
You guys have tried it, right?

538
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Yeah, but is that a bowl people are reaching their dog hair covered hands into Justin?

539
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Yeah, have a scoop and tiny bowls Travis even that I I was to say I've worked

540
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Is this gonna be funny?

541
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Well, it was a dog grooming place

542
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,760
Are you gonna tell us about the expressing anal juices?

543
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Okay, dog hair and peach pie is actually a thing, right?

544
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
This is what I say

545
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,760
If I'm tending to a diuretic emu for example

546
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Who's just like big tall bird shitting everywhere and you're like, do you want some pie?

547
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,760
It's like look at me. I got my hand up a rhinoceros his asshole trying to impress

548
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,760
This is escalating it went from dog hair to emo to fisting a rhinoceros

549
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Not emo

550
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Emo Phillips is fine and he does not need me to impregnate him

551
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
He goes to a person doctor

552
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
He doesn't need you to Justin

553
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,760
I wish you, I would love to bear your children

554
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,760
That's fantastic

555
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,760
It's gonna be heartbroken when he finds out about the vasectomy

556
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
He's gonna be so sad

557
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Man, if you all could see this

558
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,760
Did you?

559
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
You had a vasectomy

560
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,760
If you all could see how pleased Justin looks with himself and realizing how good he is at this emo Phillips impression

561
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,760
It's always thrilling when you find that you have one

562
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,760
When you have a good one inside you

563
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
He's there

564
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
Yeah, yeah

565
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,760
I'm also just realizing that taco in addition to my friend Michael Beck is heavily emo Phillips inspired

566
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
100%

567
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,760
Even a cobbler

568
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,760
A cobbler

569
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,760
You can't fuck up the serving size of a cobbler

570
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Oh I see you've got a patch in your loafers, allow me to cobble them

571
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Wow Justin, you're busting yourself up today

572
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,760
I was just thinking about opening a cobbler shop

573
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:48,760
Just like, bring your old beat down Nikes and I'll take them apart as they disintegrate in my hands

574
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,760
What you do is you got shoes on one side and baked goods on the other

575
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,760
You're selling cobblers, you're cobbling cobblers to make cobbler shoes

576
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,760
I love it

577
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
Now I will say this, here's the catch 22 by the way

578
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,760
In case anyone gets the same impulse to bake a pie for a new workplace

579
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Buy a dozen donuts, it will be a way bigger hit and way less effort

580
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
And that sucks

581
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
It does suck

582
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,760
Because you should get rewarded for like, I worked so hard on this pie

583
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Great

584
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
But a dozen donuts will be a way bigger hit

585
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,760
You can save more donuts

586
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,760
If you are somebody who does a hobby that you share with people

587
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,760
This happens with woodworking all the time, if I make someone a woodworking gift

588
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,760
They will never display the amount of gratitude I need them to do

589
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:41,760
To account for the literal dozens of man hours that it took me to make this thing

590
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
And baking is the same way

591
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,760
You got to make it because you love it, because no one's going to honor that time that you've spent on that in the way that you want to do

592
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
No way

593
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,760
You could have got it at Kroger, they don't know

594
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,760
They don't know that you hand, unless they do

595
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,760
And if they definitely do, then maybe it's time to go back to Piesquare

596
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
Different workplace

597
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
Yeah, I think your original instincts may have been right on this one

598
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,760
Yeah, we came back around to it, but you're right

599
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,760
Find an easier job for real

600
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Sell your pies on Etsy or something, people are doing that left and right

601
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Yeah

602
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,760
Are they? Can I buy a pie on Etsy? Hold on guys, I got to go

603
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
I think you can buy whatever you want on Etsy

604
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
I really want to do this one briefly

605
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
I got super high

606
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
I bought a gun on Etsy

607
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,760
I got super high

608
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Do you guys want to hear about my Etsy? It says live laugh love on it

609
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,760
And it's got seashells glued to it

610
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,760
I got super high and decided to reach out to people I hadn't talked to in a long time

611
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,760
The question actually says I decided to reach out to you people I hadn't talked to in a long time

612
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Which is like, you did not reach out to us, I would have remembered this

613
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,760
I was feeling good about myself, but when I woke up I realized I hadn't given an explanation

614
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Just a single word, hey, around midnight

615
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Nice

616
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Is there any way I can fix this?

617
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,760
Most of these people I hadn't talked to in over five years

618
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Did they respond?

619
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,760
They did not clarify if there had been any responses

620
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,760
Now I can say, I mentioned Derek earlier

621
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,760
He was somebody I knew as a child

622
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,760
He clogged real good

623
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
He was an amazing clogger

624
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
I brought him to church once

625
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,760
They set up a stage and he clogged to Janet Jackson's If at my church

626
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
Come on

627
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Fucking hell

628
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
It was so fucking fresh

629
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Anyway, I haven't talked to Derek in ten years

630
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
But I was at this Weird Al concert

631
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,760
And then I got, later on that evening I got a little elevated

632
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
As one does

633
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,760
And I decided I gotta get elevated

634
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
Elevated

635
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Well no, Travis, that makes it sound like the Weird Al music got Justin completely fucked up

636
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,760
No, it got him part of the way there

637
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,760
It did, but then I got home and I was like, I was a little bit, and I was like

638
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,760
So I sent a Facebook message that's like, hey, just wanted to see how you're doing

639
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Went to a Killer Weird Al show tonight

640
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:59,760
I mean, I didn't realize until after I sent it that a lot of typos was 1145 at night

641
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,760
Also have never sent him a Facebook message or anything else before ever

642
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,760
And was casually talking to him as though we had texted earlier that morning

643
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,760
But then

644
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
No response

645
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
It sucks

646
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Still trying to find him actually

647
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,760
Can't find old Derek, but I'm sure he's out there somewhere

648
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Well, this is not an invitation for our audience

649
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
Please don't

650
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,760
You could then text him again like, I said hey

651
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
Double down on it

652
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Hey is the worst

653
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,760
Hey at midnight

654
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,760
God almighty, what a boner

655
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,760
It's just as bad as it could be, eh?

656
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
It's as bad as it could be

657
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Because there's no read on that that is flattering to you

658
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
Like the best read on that is like

659
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,760
No one is going to be like, I'll consider it

660
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
I'll consider it

661
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
Especially there's the context of the time

662
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
It was like 5 p.m.

663
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
It could be like, maybe they just had a question

664
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Maybe they just had a question specific for me

665
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
And they wanted to see if this is still my number

666
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
Midnight, they're high

667
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,760
The best case for you, or they think you got hacked

668
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,760
And that's best case for you

669
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,760
And maybe this is a good way for you to get your foot in the door

670
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,760
Is 72 hours later, you text them again

671
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Just like, hey, I got hacked

672
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,760
So don't click on that, hey

673
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,760
You know the problem with that? It's a lie

674
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,760
It's a lie

675
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Oh, okay

676
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Hey, text him this

677
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,760
I got hacked by Hi Travis

678
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,760
Weed hacked my body

679
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
And made me contact you

680
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,760
It's just like, hey, I'm sorry I sent you a random hey

681
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,760
I was extremely high, but I did miss you

682
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
That part was earnest

683
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
I hope you're well

684
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Oh, shit

685
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,760
Okay, Justin, take it a little bit

686
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
Say, I got contact high

687
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,760
And when they're like, what?

688
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,760
Well, that's when I got high and I contacted people

689
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,760
And now it's a good joke

690
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,760
That's a good joke

691
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
And now you're like, you're back in it, right?

692
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,760
The room's warm

693
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760

But can you?

784
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,760
My name is Justin McElroy

785
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
I'm Travis McElroy

786
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
I don't know what

787
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,760
Twist it up tonight

788
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Sounds like this could be

789
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,760
It actually sounded like

790
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
The beginning of a bop it game

791
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
This has been my brother

792
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
My brother and me

793
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
Kids Who Dance Square

794
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Twist it, bop it tonight

795
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

796
00:56:45,760 --> 00:57:12,760
It's a battle with you
