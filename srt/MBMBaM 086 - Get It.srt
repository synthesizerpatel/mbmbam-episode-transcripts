1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let us welcome you to 20 Does.

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040
20 Does or 20 Doesn't.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,320
20 Does, 20 Do this year. I have a, what do you guys feel about 20 Does? Because I feel like

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,440
it's going to be real super hyphy.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm thinking that in the future people will refer to this year as the really doesn't.

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,240
I want people to refer to it as the my brother, my brother and me year.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
Is that, can we do that?

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,040
The year of my brother, my brother and me?

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah. My bim bam year.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,040
I have resolved myself to making 20 Does the year that I just get it.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
I just want to get it this year.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,160
A lot of times I see Griffin and I'm like,

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,560
he is going at it full bore, but I'm not sure he's getting it.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,400
When is that fool just going to steal his nerves and ready himself and just get it?

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,160
It seems like we're always so close to getting that brass ring.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,440
20 Does I think is the year where we grab it just by its big round body and say, hello ring.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,680
Hello ring, you're mine now. I got you.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,800
We got you this time.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,040
We got you this time in 20 Does.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,400
This is my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,840
And for the new listeners in 20 Does, maybe we can explain what we do.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
What is it we does on this show?

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,760
We get it.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,720
We get it?

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Every time.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,720
You give us your questions and you say, guys, I'm not getting it.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm not going full bore.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,320
And we say, listen, amp it.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
First you amp it and then you get it.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
You got to fire on all eight cylinders all the time.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,280
All eight.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
You got to punch the sky.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Punch the sky.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,880
No, we take questions that people send in and we answer them to the best of our ability,

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,080
which usually isn't pretty good.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
And also we do the same thing to people in the Yahoo Answers service

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
who did not send in their questions,

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
but we still give them the full consideration of our heart of hearts.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,960
And then sometimes we do a Mad Lib.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
Sometimes Travis does a Mad Lib.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
You won't hear that on this episode because it's the new year

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
and we're all far too hung over to put up with that.

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,000
Yep.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Yep.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Like, for example, the level of comedy you're going to get

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
when Griffin said far too hung over.

54
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,320
I heard fart toot hung over.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,160
So that's about it.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,600
Solid gold.

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Solid gold brass ring.

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
Did you guys take 2000 in Heaven out with a bang last night?

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
And by a bang, I mean drinking?

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,920
Absolutely.

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,200
I consume beverages.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,360
And hey, this is to like everybody on TV.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Can I go through a year?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
Can I, is it possible?

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Is it legal to ring in a new year without the Black Eyed Peas there?

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Like, do they, are they just, are they building the ball

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
and making it drop like the beat?

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
Because I have to assume one of their parents is financing the whole thing

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
and that's how they get to keep playing.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,760
Has to be.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
Like they sponsored all of 2012.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
It's like their year.

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,160
It's like, it seems like you can't do anything

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
without one of those guys sneaking in.

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
Yeah.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,600
They, they officiated my wedding.

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeah.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,920
Against your will.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Against my will.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
I didn't want to, but God, once they make the beat drop.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,440
Yeah.

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
Let the beat drop.

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Then like, I didn't have a say in the matter anymore.

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Yeah.

88
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
And you were like, I thought it was supposed to be a different priest

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,240
and they were like, this is mega switch up.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah.

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
Last night there was.

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
Is that Black Eyed Peasly Arc?

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeah.

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,600
Yeah.

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
Mega switch up.

96
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,400
Last night, Will.i.am did a solo number and he was introduced by Fergie and not,

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,560
she didn't make reference to the fact that she knows him fairly well.

98
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,880
Being in the Black Eyed Peas and all.

99
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
It was like, he, she, she just said, now this is new up.

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
So Will.i.am, check him out.

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
My former cohort.

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
My former cohort before the debt.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,400
Known associate, Will.i.am.

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
We were employed together by the beat.

105
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,960
Now a man I know from a Dr. Pepper commercial we did together, it's Will.i.am.

106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,200
But enough advising Fergie.

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,760
She stopped listening after the first time we did a fun drive.

108
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,880
So she's a fair weather fan at best.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Let's move on to the real stalwarts.

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,640
Guys, I just got a haircut and I hate it.

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,760
At the barbershop, I took off my glasses for the haircut and when it was over,

112
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,120
I couldn't see how it looked.

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,640
I just assumed it was fine.

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
When I got home, I looked in the mirror and noticed that it was horrible.

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Is it okay to go back to the barbershop and demand a redo?

116
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,840
How can I make it as unawkward as possible?

117
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
That's from Campion10.

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,560
Campion, I don't think you know how hair works.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah, you don't get a mulligan.

120
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
You just get a mullet.

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,880
Yeah, you, it doesn't like, you're not a Play-Doh man.

122
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,840
I'm confused by the concept that like, so I get me, I have to take my glasses off too

123
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,560
when I get a haircut.

124
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Everyone with glasses does.

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,880
Did you fail to put them on before you got home?

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah.

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,840
Like crash.

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Bad haircut.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Is it possible that it actually looks pretty dope and you're just not used to it?

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah.

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Hey, let me see.

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Let me take a look.

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Pull your haircut up to your iPod.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah, looks good.

135
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,880
The trick, do you guys want to know the trick to always getting a good haircut?

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,360
What's that?

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Well, I know this, people, stylists die for this kind of info, so I can't believe I'm

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
giving it out for free.

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,120
What you have to do is get a haircut from somebody who you think is attractive.

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh, really?

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,080
Yeah, because they're not going to cut, they know what looks good, obviously.

142
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,480
Look at how attractive they are, right?

143
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,760
They want to shape other people into other good looking people, so there's more people

144
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,840
at the sex parties that they want to get invited to if they're ugly.

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,800
Right.

146
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
I'm saying no pretty is going to make you into an elko.

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Unless they're hoarding it.

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Unless they're doing it on purpose to make themselves look better.

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
That's why you got to go to the opposite sex.

150
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
If you go to someone of the same sex, they don't want the competition for the pack.

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah, and they might give you a tonsure up there, or they might just slit your throat.

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah, bake you into pies.

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
The barber saw a racist fingerprint, so they would never be caught.

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
Yeah, I mean, they're sitting in a chair that's surrounded with pictures of your kids.

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
So there are clues, I'm not saying there are clues.

156
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,160
Before you returned to the barber and asked for a redo, did you save your receipt?

157
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Because without your receipt, you don't get that redo.

158
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,120
Really?

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
Yeah.

160
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,400
You have to present documentation, huh?

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah, otherwise you roll up and the barber's like, I don't even remember you.

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
You just have an ugly haircut now.

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
I would never cut that hair that way.

164
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,920
If it's a bad haircut, I think you need to go.

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,600
I don't think there's an unawkward way of doing it.

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,080
I think you need to go to somebody else and say, hey, what can you do for me?

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,400
Because obviously you don't like their haircut style.

168
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
You don't like how they're doing it.

169
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
Go to someplace else.

170
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
You know, I've actually done this before.

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
I've actually gone back to a place and been like, hey, this is kind of weak.

172
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,640
And it was like the sides of my hair were uneven or something.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
They cut one side shorter than the other.

174
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
It was real bad.

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
And then I rolled back up to the place and I was like, hey, fix it.

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
Yeah, can you?

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
I mean, that is just, that's just shoddy workmanship.

178
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
That's not even a style question.

179
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,480
Unless that's a hip style now.

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
Is the R. Kelly long on one side, short on the other?

181
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,640
Right.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Nine tenths of good haircutting cutsmanship is preparation.

183
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
I think you got to go, you got to find the right person.

184
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
If you go to a barbershop, I have this a lot in Austin as I'll go to a barbershop

185
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
and it'll be one of those rando situations, like a upscale fantastic Sam's.

186
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Or I, you know, sit down and who knows who I get this time.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
And sometimes it's an attractive woman.

188
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,760
And sometimes it's a man and half of his hair is bleached blonde and the other half is bright pink.

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,520
And he's like, let's do this. And I'm like, I don't think I want to do this.

190
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,120
I don't know what's going to happen up there.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,320
If this happens, I want to hold out, hold out for a new, I'm going to hold out.

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,880
I'm going to sit here.

193
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm going to finish my Shiner and I'm going to read the paper.

194
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:34,640
Ladies and gentlemen, if you, if you, if you get a good haircut once ever, never, you can't move.

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
You can't go hold on to that person.

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,560
They're the most valuable person to you in your whole life because they know how to cut it the way you like it.

197
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
I have for a while, I was driving back to my girl, Mo, back in Huntington.

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,200
My man, my man, Sunny, up at the, up at the master cuts, up at the Huntington mall, just, just, just next to tilt the arcade.

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
He, he will, he will take care of you.

200
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,200
Tell him, tell him Justin sent you.

201
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
Cause he remembers my name.

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
He remembers my name.

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
He remembers my name.

204
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,080
He remembers my name.

205
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
He remembers my name.

206
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
Tell him, tell him Justin set you cause he remembers my name.

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
Well, he calls me buddy, but I know he knows my name.

208
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
I bet he always just calls me buddy.

209
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Why don't you buzz it?

210
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
Ooh, buzz it down self, self medication there, huh?

211
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
I've been actually thinking about it's ridiculous.

212
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
I go to a barber and I paid them $13 to buzz my hair with a size six guard.

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Like I think I could probably do that myself.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm impressed that you know the size guard that you use when I go in.

215
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
If I don't, what if they use a size four guard?

216
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840
And then it's like, well, see, that's what's weird.

217
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
I walk in and they say, what size?

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
And I'm like, I honestly couldn't tell you.

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
And they're like, you know, we'll start with like a three or something.

220
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
And then it's always too short.

221
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
Always too short.

222
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Learn your number folks.

223
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
Life is so hard.

224
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,560
Yeah.

225
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
Here's what I do.

226
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,040
It haircut, hair cutters love this.

227
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Just start, just say, just clean it up a little bit and then just keep telling them that like,

228
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
no, not quite clean enough.

229
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
And that way you can ease them into it.

230
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
And then when it works, take a picture.

231
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
You're going to sound like you have like OCD or something.

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,880
My hair is not clean enough.

233
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,040
You're the one that has to live with the haircut for six months or eight months

234
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,920
or maybe even like 12 months.

235
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
I need you to make it cleaner on the sides by which I mean,

236
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
shave my basketball number into those.

237
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
They call me clean sweep.

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,200
Will you please take up one sideburn, but just the one.

239
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,280
Can you put those fun lines in the side?

240
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
Hey, I have a job car up there.

241
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,480
Please.

242
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I have a job interview in the new year for position.

243
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,160
I'm totally under qualified for it.

244
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
It'd give me a great salary.

245
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
It's pretty much my dream job and it would allow me to move to London.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,760
How can I fool my interviewers into thinking their company will go into administration?

247
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,400
Unless I'm on board.

248
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,080
That's from skeptical in Scotland.

249
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,120
For those that don't know, going into administration is like going bankrupt here.

250
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
Ah, okay.

251
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
Here?

252
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,280
In the US of A.

253
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,760
Oh, okay.

254
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,480
What did you think I meant?

255
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,000
On this show?

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,080
Well, here my brother, my brother and me.

257
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,320
You made it sound like we were in the UK.

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Oh, okay.

259
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,840
Pushing made it so.

260
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,560
Okay.

261
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
Yeah, we'll get over there UK.

262
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
You just hold out.

263
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
Start sending us money now.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,640
Why wouldn't you qualify yourself for your dream job?

265
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,560
What are you doing?

266
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
Why is the one thing you want to do more than anything on earth the one thing you're not

267
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
qualified to do?

268
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,600
What have you been preparing to do?

269
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,280
Yeah, what have you been preparing for?

270
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
Did something else fall through?

271
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,000
I dream of being a ballerina so I've trained to be a lumberjack and I just hope it works out.

272
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Maybe just don't tell them you're under qualified.

273
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah, I mean, yes, Travis.

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
I think that that goes without saying is don't say don't give me this job because I'd be bad

275
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,800
at it.

276
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,080
No, but I'm saying like I don't know what special prep you would have to do because

277
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,760
they like can't read your mind.

278
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
They're not going to give you an on the spot test.

279
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,840
My name is Dylan and I'm from Scotland and I'm unqualified for this position.

280
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
I suck at this.

281
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know where I am.

282
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
This is my dream.

283
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
So you made this come true.

284
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,040
Maybe, maybe you could play that aspect and be like, listen, straight up.

285
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,760
I have no idea the fuck what I'm doing, but think of how educational this experience.

286
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
I am a lump of clay.

287
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,920
Think about how I will learn from this.

288
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Think about how I will better my oh no.

289
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
Oh, okay.

290
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
You're standing up.

291
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,960
Is that it?

292
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, I should go.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,640
Okay, so I should just I should just here's the thing in this day and age.

294
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,320
People change jobs, millennials, no one is tied to any one position anymore, which makes

295
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,920
which makes it makes a creating past work experience just the easiest thing.

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Yeah, pick a friend, give right down their cell phone number.

297
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,280
Say they were the manager at the now defunct, etc.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,400
And then and then have the manager call them.

299
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,720
Your friend will say whatever you tell him to, you know, have have the manager call us.

300
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
We'll say whatever you want.

301
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
Yeah, yeah, I'll say I'll lie.

302
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,960
I'll put my five dollars, I'll tell them you were president.

303
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,600
Can you stretch your job titles at your jobs?

304
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
Because nobody definitely nobody's going to check that.

305
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,120
Like, instead of being a cashier at Taco Bell, say you were like a taco coordinator.

306
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,000
I was a sort of a gordita middleman.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
I guess you could say I think what you're looking for is chalupa artisan.

308
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
I was a nacho cheese engineer.

309
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
That part is true.

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,200
Is it possible that it's not like they're underqualified,

311
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,000
like they don't have the use of experience, but they're underqualified?

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,720
Like, it's a job as like an engineer or like as a surgeon and they just don't.

313
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
Well, I fucking hope it's not a surgeon.

314
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Yeah, I hope so, too.

315
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,120
I don't think the people who listen to our show are clinically unstable,

316
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
which seems to be the picture that you're painting.

317
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,800
Now, come in here, Dylan.

318
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,960
What prepares you to be a marine biologist?

319
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,480
Nothing.

320
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,960
Nothing.

321
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,320
Absolutely nothing.

322
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,840
I like fish and I'm scared of water.

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,560
Let's get this done.

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's learn some shit about otters.

325
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,400
I got you.

326
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
I got an underwater microscope.

327
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,560
Come on.

328
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,520
Science.

329
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
Where's the whale?

330
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
Where's the whale at?

331
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,080
Which one's the shark again?

332
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,480
Okay.

333
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,080
I want to put my microscope on a shark.

335
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm going to call in that big fish like Jonah did.

336
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,520
Remember?

337
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,120
Learn about his inside part.

338
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,760
By the way, I only believe in sciences in the Bible.

339
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,960
Let's do this.

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm unqualified.

341
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,040
The Bible and Pinocchio.

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
This is my dream.

343
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,520
This is my dream, sir.

344
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
This is my dream job.

345
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
I fucking hate fish.

346
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,880
I hate this.

347
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,440
Let's do it.

348
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
Come on, you slimy bitches.

349
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
Look at him flop around on the table.

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,720
This is crazy.

351
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,720
Somebody get me a science knife.

352
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
I'm going to go to town on this fish.

353
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,640
Give me a science knife.

354
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,080
I gots to cut this whale open.

355
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,400
Tell you what, I'm not qualified for this job,

356
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,880
but I'm going to dissect this octopus right in front of you.

357
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,360
Watch.

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,400
You watch.

359
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,960
You watch.

360
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm going to cut off some squid legs.

361
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,080
Put it on this octopus.

362
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Make the ultimate tentacle monster animal.

363
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
Is this science yet?

364
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,080
Did we do it?

365
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
I want to do some science.

366
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
Drop me in this tank.

367
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm going to tie this octopus's legs together like Popeye.

368
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Come on.

369
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm going to do some science.

370
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,600
Drop me a beat.

371
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Drop me a beat.

372
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Drop me a beat.

373
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,640
I'll write something like Bill Nye.

374
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,360
Science guy.

375
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
Like a science song.

376
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,240
You guys want to?

377
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
Oh, marine biologists.

378
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
I bet you didn't know your job was that funny,

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
but that's exactly the kind of insight you can expect every week in 20 Does.

380
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,560
Here, I'm my brother.

381
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,200
My brother and me.

382
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
You want a Yahoo?

383
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,440
Yes, please.

384
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
First Yahoo of 20 Does.

385
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,280
20 Does.

386
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,920
Let's make it count.

387
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
This one was sent in by Team Money.

388
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,200
Thank you, Team Money.

389
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,760
You're welcome.

390
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
It's by Yahoo answer user Chi, who asks,

391
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
is there a charity where I can donate to walruses?

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
I really love walruses.

393
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,840
And I would like to donate to them.

394
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,280
Is there one you could think of?

395
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,480
Thank you for your help, everyone.

396
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,200
Happy New Year.

397
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,680
Like directly to the walrus?

398
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,960
That's what it sounds like, isn't it?

399
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,720
He wants to get right at him.

400
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,560
He doesn't want it to get hung up in like overhead.

401
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah.

402
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Where can I take my walrus sweaters?

403
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,960
I want this.

404
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,920
I don't want this overhead.

405
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,520
I want to under tusk in their mouth.

406
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,760
I think the most direct option is obviously go to the Arctic Circle

407
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
and fucking just make it rain.

408
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Make it rain fish.

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Just like stick some hundos to their blubbery, wrinkly, gray skin.

410
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,200
A lot of people don't know what walruses need, walruses need now.

411
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
What do they need?

412
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Like after the terrible earthquakes in Haiti, a lot of people were like,

413
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,280
send money, send dollars, just send us some cash.

414
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,240
But then they didn't realize they have different money in Haiti.

415
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
So they couldn't do anything with it.

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,560
They ate it.

417
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,240
They used the money.

418
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
They used the dollar bills to make compresses and food.

419
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
They didn't know what to do with it.

420
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,920
You know, I actually read about this.

421
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,840
You know what walruses need more than anything?

422
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,800
What's that?

423
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,360
Counseling.

424
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah.

425
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,120
Really?

426
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,520
Are they?

427
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,320
Yeah, they just need to talk.

428
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
They just need to talk.

429
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
They are the ugliest thing on the earth, I think.

430
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
You know, it's that kind of mentality that are giving these walruses issues.

431
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
That's kind of cruel of God, isn't it though?

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,520
And he's like, let's make them put sharp stuff on their face.

433
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
Let's make them fat.

434
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,480
And then also, let's throw a mustache on them.

435
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,280
And then let's make them really, really sensitive.

436
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
Not a lot of people know that they are the most emotionally sensitive animals.

437
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
Now, they don't seem awful enough.

438
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,720
So let's make them eat seals, which is nature's most beautiful animal.

439
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
Yeah, and make them look like ugly seals.

440
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
So like the parallelism is lost.

441
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800
It's going to be really great.

442
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,040
Can you imagine when you're a walrus?

443
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,600
Like at first, you think, well, this sucks.

444
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
But at least everybody else is in the same boat as me.

445
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,840
And then the first time you see like a beautiful deer, or like a beautiful pelican.

446
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
Just a water deer skippering across the water.

447
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,800
Look at that beautiful water stag.

448
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,240
Like, oh, you got you have four legs instead of one stupid leg.

449
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,200
Oh, you don't bark like an idiot.

450
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,680
Okay, great.

451
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,560
Cute little bushy tail.

452
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,960
That's great.

453
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
Hey, where's your mustache?

454
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,720
Don't have one.

455
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Oh, you don't have one.

456
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
Don't have one.

457
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,680
Can we get these walruses some like mustache tremors?

458
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't think they want that.

459
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,240
That's a sign of everybody knows that the walrus's facial hair is the sign of their masculinity.

460
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,760
Okay, what about mustache wax?

461
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
Let's turn that into handlebars.

462
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah, now see that with some preening.

463
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
I bet they love that.

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
That would help them to feel not so bad about themselves.

465
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,040
Walruses do love irony.

466
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,680
If we could wrap some tight denim around their chubby, chunky tails.

467
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Can we get some walrus skinny jeans, please?

468
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,440
Thank God knows they could use it.

469
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
I was into krill long, long before it was popular.

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,920
Hey, did you guys get the new Krillex?

471
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,720
Oh, Krillex.

472
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
God damn.

473
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
Yeah, he's always good for a laugh.

474
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,720
He sure is.

475
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Well, at least for me he is.

476
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,040
Hey brothers, I was wondering what you thought about dating girls who have a much different

477
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,120
personality and lifestyle from your own.

478
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
I have this friend and I was thinking about asking her out sometime soon, but the more

479
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
I just hang out with her, I see that her lifestyle is very different from my own.

480
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,760
She's the kind of girl who would go out to a party at night.

481
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
Well, I would rather spend the night relaxing in my dorm room.

482
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,160
And now I just question whether having a different lifestyle should stop me

483
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
from asking her out at all.

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,280
That's from asking in Alaska.

485
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,480
No, it shouldn't stop you.

486
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,440
Next.

487
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
I mean, it could be exciting, right?

488
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
That's love.

489
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
That's what the heart wants.

490
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
I mean, not a lot can be done about that.

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,280
Although, I mean, will it force you?

492
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,920
You have to realize that in a sense, this could be very good for you, right?

493
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,040
Like, I think it's good to have that balance in a relationship where one person wants to

494
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,400
do this, another person wants to do another thing, and you find a happy medium.

495
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Now, there might be some friction as a result, but I think it's better for yourself in the

496
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,120
long run.

497
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
It's better for your day to day.

498
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
Just be prepared to...

499
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
You're gonna have to be prepared to be flexible about it.

500
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,360
You're gonna have to be prepared to, you know?

501
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,080
To give a little.

502
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,520
Exactly.

503
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,760
I would say the only concern I would have about it is if her behavior is in any way

504
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,560
self-destructive.

505
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Like, you know, if by partying, I mean, like, she's going out and just, you know, doing

506
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
a bunch of drugs and destroying herself, then I could see why that would be a problem.

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,440
But if she just likes to have a good time and hang out with her friends and is a social

508
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,280
person, then maybe, you know, when you're in that relationship, maybe there's a balance

509
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,600
where you go out more often than you normally would, and she stays home with you more often

510
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,320
than she normally would, and you find a good balance and kind of, you know, are good for

511
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,960
each other.

512
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
Guys, what we're dealing with here is a classic along came Polly scenario.

513
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
Yeah, classic Polly.

514
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,960
What you gotta do is you gotta just let yourself live, let yourself love, let yourself...

515
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
And then eat some sidewalk nuts.

516
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,360
Don't eat spicy Indian food at a party and then have diarrhea.

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
And wipe your butt with a ferret, if I remember correctly.

518
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,120
Oh, is that really...

519
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,480
Oh, God.

520
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Can you stop dropping, like, specific references to this movie?

521
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
Like, you just watched it this week.

522
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
It really creeps me out when you do that.

523
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,480
So you don't want me to talk about, like, you gotta watch out for when you go on your

524
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,120
honeymoon and then your wife sleeps with the scuba instructor, as played by Hank Azaria?

525
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,400
No, I don't want to know about any more along came Polly related things.

526
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,920
When you go see your best friend, Philip Seymour Hoffman in Jesus Christ Superstar at a community

527
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,240
theater.

528
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,280
This is a new year, it's a new slate, and you are muddying that slate with your shit,

529
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
with your human feces, which is along came Polly.

530
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
Yeah, but to be fair, that movie didn't introduce me to the word shart, so...

531
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,680
As it introduced America, sir.

532
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Sir, and all our lives are richer for it.

533
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,280
I would never take that away from from Philip Seymour Hoffman, but...

534
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,680
You know, you guys can give me shit all you want to, but I'm just preparing to be qualified

535
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,480
for my dream job as a long came Polly historian.

536
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,040
Okay.

537
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,320
That is my dream job too, however, I am woefully unqualified.

538
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
Woefully unqualified for it.

539
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
Have you seen that super meta movie one night at the along came Polly museum?

540
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,720
It's great.

541
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,240
It's about Ben Stiller working in a museum for along came Polly, and then all the characters

542
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,720
come to life.

543
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,120
He is still very, very sad.

544
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,480
Could not keep my Stiller straight.

545
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,160
Actually, the role of the Ben Stiller mannequin when he comes to life is played by Hank Azaria.

546
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,600
It gets very confusing.

547
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,840
Yeah.

548
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,400
And Owen Wilson, I bet it's in there somewhere too.

549
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
You know he's in the mix.

550
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Maybe playing Luke Wilson just to further muddy that.

551
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,280
Weird.

552
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,960
I just just just try it.

553
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
What's the worst that's gonna happen?

554
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,200
I mean, it's listen, it's 20 does.

555
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360
I'm gonna give this blanket advice out to everybody who's under the thrall of my voice

556
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,920
right now.

557
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,360
It's 20 does.

558
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,240
Get it.

559
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,320
If you have a question about should I, the answer is get it.

560
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,280
Yes.

561
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,400
Get it.

562
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,120
Just get it.

563
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,000
And maybe it'll work out.

564
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Maybe it won't, but you won't know until you get it.

565
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Get it.

566
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Yes.

567
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,880
No regrets in 20 does.

568
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
Just say yes.

569
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,200
Just say yes and get it.

570
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
Just go on a rampage.

571
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
We're gonna go get high and then go to the bowling alley.

572
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you in?

573
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes.

574
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,200
Get it.

575
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, I am.

576
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,360
I want to do high bowling.

577
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
I want to get strikes.

578
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
I want to get striked up.

579
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Let's go get striked up and let's go let's go bowl together.

580
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
Do you want to go to a funeral with me?

581
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,080
I would rather not.

582
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,200
But I will because I'm opening myself up to new experiences even if they're depressing

583
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,760
in some way.

584
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
We'll have some smelling salts.

585
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,440
We'll rave and we'll get it at the funeral.

586
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,760
We'll see.

587
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,040
That's what your grandma would want.

588
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,120
That's what she would want is just to rave and get nuts.

589
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
20 does guys.

590
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm done.

591
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm done equivocating with people.

592
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm done.

593
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,520
So that's the slogan.

594
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
20 does rave at a funeral.

595
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,160
Rave at a funeral.

596
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,120
20 yes.

597
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,760
We're gonna rave into this into the the great good night that will come to claim us all

598
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
in late December.

599
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,720
But until then everybody let's just give it a shot.

600
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,360
I am going to stave off Quetzalcoatl with two glow sticks on the top of a fucking mountain

601
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,880
just blasting Skrillex just like come get it.

602
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,280
Ready for you.

603
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,080
Not this day.

604
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,080
If you're gonna eat me you're gonna have to eat my stupid cat in the hat hat too.

605
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,520
Enjoy this adult size pacifier you bitch.

606
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,320
Let's make Quetzalcoatl our pitch this year and just say yes.

607
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
Do I want to ask her out?

608
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,120
Yeah sure.

609
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,800
She broke my heart.

610
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Ask again.

611
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
Ask someone different.

612
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,960
Ask that same person but in a different way.

613
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Ask her out using a Quetzalcoatl line.

614
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,280
Like listen time is limited here.

615
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,800
We need to get moving.

616
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,320
Can I ask you a Quetzalcoatl?

617
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,840
Oh shit.

618
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
Hey Griffin.

619
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,760
Yeah.

620
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah.

621
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Before Quetzalcoatl comes I need to build a bomb shelter and the only way I can do that

622
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,120
is with money and the only way I know how to make money is with The Money Zone.

623
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:05,200
This week on The Money Zone we are being driven there first off by our dear friends

624
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Vincent and Paul Goldberg.

625
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Goldberg?

626
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,240
Goldberg the goalie.

627
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,280
No Goldberg is getting butt cheek friendship tattoos.

628
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,560
They didn't know what what it was going to be and and this is a Christmas present for

629
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,880
Paul Goldberg which is everybody knows are the perfect the perfect things the perfect

630
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
thing for Paul Goldberg.

631
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,280
They want to know what they should get on their butts on their bottoms.

632
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,800
Well a tattoo that just says butt.

633
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,680
But no that's not not very good.

634
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Can the tattoo be butt colored?

635
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,320
Uh-huh a butt color tattoo?

636
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,680
So that nobody is going to see it.

637
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:54,720
I have always wanted to get a tattoo of Herve Villiches and he's rolling up his sleeve and

638
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
on his arm is a tattoo of the band Tattoo.

639
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,440
Uh-huh.

640
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
So if you guys wanted to get so many layers to that.

641
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,760
I know right.

642
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,320
If you guys want to get that tattoo of Tattoo with the Tattoo of Tattoo that would be I

643
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,960
think ideal.

644
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,720
There's probably another level of abstraction you could get there but I don't know what

645
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:12,880
it would be.

646
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Can I get a what about a tattoo of Bob Seger with a tattoo of me?

647
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
Now why would Bob Seger get a tattoo of you Griffin?

648
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,320
Well he wouldn't but in this fictional universe that I've painted on my body forever.

649
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
What about a tattoo of Bob Seger except with my head?

650
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,400
So it's Bob Seger's body.

651
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay but it would have to say like under it this is Bob Seger.

652
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,400
He has to wear a t-shirt that just says Bob Seger.

653
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,640
Okay.

654
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,920
Nobody could tell Bob Seger just by his body or at least more specifically nobody who's

655
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,400
going to see my butt could tell could tell Bob Seger just from his body.

656
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,480
So guys I hope that I hope that helps you and I hope that hope that that's that's enough

657
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,920
of a inspiration that you can find something that really works for your personal butt.

658
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,720
Also taking us to the money zone this week our friends our dear friends Topataco.

You want to peep up his nasty gum shirt?

675
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,360
They can do that.

676
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
They can make that dream a reality for you.

677
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
Do you want them to draw a really crazy picture of a rhinoceros?

678
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,200
They might do that too on your receipt.

679
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
They're crazy over there.

680
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,240
They once they once drew a picture of a really disturbed really disturbing picture of

681
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,960
Lisa Loeb's glasses on somebody's package once.

682
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
It was all very upsetting but they're the best people in the world and we love them very much.

683
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
So here's a shitty song for them.

684
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,800
So here's a shitty jingle for them.

685
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't have anything.

686
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:54,560
Do you want cheese and sour cream?

687
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,120
You can't do that.

688
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,720
It's not a taco.

689
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,600
It's a website and they sell t-shirts for free.

690
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,760
No, they're not free.

691
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,160
They cost actual money, but that money goes to us.

692
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,800
Topataco.com and buy stuff.

693
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,200
Specifically maximum fun gear.

694
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
So we don't buy.

695
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
I want that maximum fun.

696
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,280
Don't buy anything that says stop podcasting yourself or judge John Hodge or any of those other guys.

697
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
Jordan Jesse go forget.

698
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,240
Jordan Jesse no, I say.

699
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,560
Just buy our stuff and give us your money.

700
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,160
My brother and my brother in glee is what you'll have in your heart when you buy our stuff.

701
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,320
In fact, what you should do is you should pay them extra money to not send you the other stuff.

702
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah, here's $10 to not send me a Jordan Jesse go shit.

703
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,840
God, I love money.

704
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,160
I love it too.

705
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,040
I love it too, but do actually buy their stuff too because we love it.

706
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Yeah, their stuff is fine.

707
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,200
But first buy our stuff.

708
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't use all your don't use up all your money.

709
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,440
We need it.

710
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,840
You should buy our stuff and then buy their stuff to keep our stuff in.

711
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,400
It's a t-shirt I bought for my t-shirt to keep it warm.

712
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,120
Hello there.

713
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,680
My name is Graham Clark and I'm Dave Shumka.

714
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,520
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

715
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,920
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your pod.

716
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,360
What's that about you ask?

717
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,800
Well, who are you to ask?

718
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,920
Who do you think you are?

719
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Yeah, get lost bozo.

720
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,320
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

721
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

722
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
Sometimes they're Canadian.

723
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
Sometimes they're not.

724
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,880
Sometimes they're a ghost.

725
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,160
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

726
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,960
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

727
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,840
You can find us on iTunes or online at Maximumfun.org.

728
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,680
You guys want a Yahoo?

729
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,640
Yeah.

730
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

731
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,640
Thank you, Lisa.

732
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,360
It's by Yahoo!

733
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,520
Industries user CrashFu who asks,

734
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,960
what is a good team name for a softball team sponsored by a male performance enhancement

735
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,280
clinic?

736
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,120
True story, I was thinking 10 bats and 20 balls, but that's a load to put on a shirt.

737
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,620
Help.

738
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,960
Big swingers.

739
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,040
Well, that, that, that, um, I guess that has a certain charm.

740
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,760
Sort of feel.

741
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,800
Um, bat boys.

742
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,200
So you're just sticking with the, a bat looks like a penis.

743
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,700
Yeah.

744
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,240
Bonus.

745
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,740
Okay.

746
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,280
I gotcha.

747
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,780
Okay.

748
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,640
Okay. Well, that one was not very good.

749
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:02,440
That one, uh, um, can it be like a traditional team?

750
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,600
Like the Levitra Lions is Levitra.

751
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,640
The Boner Tigers.

752
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,140
Okay.

753
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,640
Travis, I don't think you're very good at this.

754
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Um, Cox Cox.

755
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,840
And it's like penis and a rooster.

756
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,400
No, that one needs to be worse.

757
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
No, that one needs to be workshopped a little bit more.

758
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,920
Let's start over.

759
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,520
No, let's think about this because there's a lot of questions you have to answer first.

760
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,680
Okay.

761
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,640
Let me ask you this.

762
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,800
What do you think about not so shortstop?

763
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,120
Ooh, that's good.

764
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,880
That's not bad, right?

765
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,600
That's, that's something, something there, ma'am.

766
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,740
Hmm.

767
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,680
Do you think?

768
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,520
Humpire.

769
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,640
Humpire?

770
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,600
Humpire?

771
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,100
No.

772
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,780
No, that's not, that's not bad.

773
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,260
Do you think that anybody?

774
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,180
RBI runs bonered in.

775
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,580
Okay.

776
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,140
I'm more confused by the mechanics of the team.

777
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:05,460
I want to know if anybody on the team is physically capable of diving into a plate without,

778
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,180
I think they're going to land right on the boner is what I think.

779
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,740
And I think that that's kind of put some friction on the ground.

780
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,900
I think it's going to keep them from reaching their destination

781
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,060
and also break their penis in half.

782
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,620
It'll at least break the bone.

783
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,340
Look at a fracture.

784
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,820
Definitely fracture that penis bone.

785
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,940
I think it would be, this would be the team that you would probably dread playing against.

786
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,340
Well, yeah.

787
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,980
Because they got that self-satisfied look on their faces.

788
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,460
And you can't bring your children.

789
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,780
Yeah.

790
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,300
Concession stands hated because nobody wants to buy a corn dog and watch the team.

791
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,700
Can anybody, can any local business have a baseball team?

792
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,340
Because if so, that seems, that seems kind of fucked up.

793
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,380
Like can funeral homes be like, Hey, we're the dead people team.

794
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:55,620
And can like, can like sex, sex, candy, toy stores be like, you know, sex, candy, toy stores.

795
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,660
Yeah.

796
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,900
Well, at least it would make, it would make lines.

797
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,460
Then that would be very easy to pick a mascot.

798
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:01,780
Yeah.

799
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,220
And the pleasure chest pirates.

800
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,500
Right.

801
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,980
Exactly.

802
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,940
I'm willing to bet that when you are a, an amateur softball team,

803
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,420
beggars can't be choosers.

804
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,820
Yeah.

805
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,740
I doubt very much that there's, there's much wiggle room there as far as who you

806
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,940
allow to sponsor your team.

807
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,460
And if you don't, what about wiggle room?

808
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,140
Yeah.

809
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,380
I think there's going to be a shortage of wiggle room all around.

810
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,020
Can we get back to our community and start our own softball team?

811
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,300
My brother, my brother and me boners.

812
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,020
Well, can we actually look into how much it would be, how much it would cost to sponsor

813
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,740
a softball team in someone's area?

814
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,140
200 tops, right?

815
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,740
Tops 200. Yeah.

816
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,500
Like so well worth it.

817
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,940
I mean, how much does a bat cost?

818
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,060
They only need the one bat.

819
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,460
That's like 10 bucks.

820
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,340
10 bucks for the bat.

821
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,900
If you're a local softball team would like us to sponsor them, please email us.

822
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,380
No kidding.

823
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,980
We have a, like, I don't want to toot our horns, but we have a grip of listeners.

824
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,020
Certainly we can find 10 people who are baseball.

825
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,940
Can you be the Bim Bambinos?

826
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,980
Oh my God.

827
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,580
That's a fucking awesome name, right?

828
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,460
Mm-hmm.

829
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:07,700
Yeah.

830
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,260
It'd be good.

831
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,980
It would be really good.

832
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,060
But I would want to go with something like my brother, my brother and me, like home run.

833
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,940
Murderers.

834
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,260
Yeah.

835
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,900
The murderers.

836
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,020
The molesters.

837
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,260
I don't want to play against that team.

838
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,620
Okay, so we'll sponsor your team.

839
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,860
But in exchange, you have to have like the most embarrassing name.

840
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,700
I don't think that, I think that no matter what you can call your team,

841
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:42,260
people are not going to, they're not going to like you because of the connotations of your sponsor.

842
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,420
That's all they're going to be able to think about.

843
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,220
They're not going to, maybe that would be good as a smoke screen though.

844
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:53,300
They're giggling up their sleeve about how you're like the Viagra vagabonds or something.

845
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,260
And meanwhile, you're getting all the touchdowns.

846
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,380
I think that you just hit on a great name, Justin, and you could be the Viagra gigglers.

847
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,860
What about hard dicks?

848
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,460
Go on.

849
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,540
That's it.

850
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,620
Okay, okay.

851
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,260
What about it?

852
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,220
All right, well, that's a pretty good starting point.

853
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,500
What about erections with a Z?

854
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,300
New erections.

855
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,380
Second chance erections.

856
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:37,780
I feel like baseball doesn't have enough sexual innuendo goofing possibilities.

857
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:46,180
Like I feel like if this was basketball, we would already have like 100 to 125 different names.

858
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,660
Do you think basketball is a sexier sport than baseball?

859
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,140
No, I just think that baseball, because they've got like the bats and balls,

860
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,620
it's so, as far as like penis jokes goes, it's like it's making the joke already.

861
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:04,980
Like it's already so clear you have to go real deep cut to find anything worthwhile.

862
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:12,660
I think we've all been to a baseball arena and seen a guy with a baseball bat

863
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,140
duct tape to his crotch.

864
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,820
Like, oh, I've got a big wooden penis.

865
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,460
Like we've all seen that one.

866
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,940
That could be their mascot.

867
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,220
We've all seen that in our dreams.

868
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,580
That could be their mascot though.

869
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,620
Dick bats.

870
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,460
That's inappropriate.

871
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,260
Can that be the name?

872
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,900
The Dick Bats?

873
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,900
Dick Bats.

874
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,020
I did really love his talk show back in the late 60s.

875
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,420
The Dick Bats Variety Hour.

876
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,180
He goes by Richard Bats now.

877
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,180
He was sort of like a more more ethnic Lawrence Welk.

878
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,300
But I really liked it.

879
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,500
Did we have a single good joke in that entire question?

880
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,260
Remember when we said Dick Bats?

881
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,660
I don't think that was funny.

882
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,100
Hey everybody, this is where you get to make your own gag.

883
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,900
Just write in.

884
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,140
Say, hey, I came up with a better gag than you guys did.

885
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,700
But you got to make sure to drink a lot the night before or else you're cheating.

886
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,980
Hey, I have a brother.

887
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,460
He lives in another town, so I keep in touch with him mostly through phone conversations.

888
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,460
The problem is, sometimes he'll decide to use the bathroom in the middle of our conversation.

889
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,500
He doesn't think it's a big deal, but it grosses me out.

890
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,100
I told him that I would stop speaking to him if he continues to do it, but he's starting

891
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
to simply continue doing it without telling me.

892
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,740
You can't give your brother an opening like that.

893
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,580
Please tell my brother to stop making his bathrooms while we are making a conversation.

894
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,380
That's from Euphemistic and Eugene.

895
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,620
You can't tell your brother that you don't like something, especially something that

896
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,060
he can continue to do to you.

897
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,900
How bad are you at brothers?

898
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,400
Why?

899
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:11,060
You shouldn't be able to have a conversation with anyone except your lover.

900
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,420
Anyone except your lover in which you can have a conversation with them and also be

901
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,020
able to see and touch your penis.

902
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,260
That's just my ground rule.

903
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:29,380
That's my base level for conversation skills, is if you can see and touch your penis, you

904
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,620
shouldn't be talking to anyone.

905
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,820
That's a good rule.

906
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,580
Yeah, it's a pretty good rule, Travis.

907
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,060
It's like the best rule that there is.

908
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,580
If you can see and touch your penis.

909
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,420
See and or see and or.

910
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,420
I can't imagine.

911
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,980
I mean, you can.

912
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,660
I guess you can always touch your penis.

913
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,900
Trust me.

914
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,940
As numerous suspensions in grade school will attest, you can always touch your penis.

915
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,700
He is your constant companion.

916
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,380
I can't imagine actually a scenario where you can see your penis but not touch it.

917
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,220
I can only think some kind of like bound and gag situation.

918
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,940
It's right there.

919
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,900
Please.

920
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,420
Why are you in that glass cage?

921
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,420
Unless you're Pikachu, I guess, in which case.

922
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,780
What if you get stuck in like a glass floor?

923
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,260
Sorry, what were you saying, Travis?

924
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,340
You're stuck in a glass floor.

925
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,460
So your top half is above the glass and your bottom half is below the glass.

926
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,460
Like if you're in a big glass castle.

927
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,060
Just think about it, guys.

928
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,380
It makes complete sense.

929
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,820
It's so fucking dumb, though.

930
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,900
It's a dumb thing.

931
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,220
I said this funny thing about Pikachu and then you're like.

932
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,860
He nailed it again.

933
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,380
How about a word fart, everybody?

934
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,820
I got one for you.

935
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,300
Remember when I said that thing about Pikachu?

936
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,100
I love that you said Pikachu and not like a T-Rex,

937
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,620
which I think more people would understand the arm to body ratio of.

938
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,140
Pikachu's got wicked short arms, everybody.

939
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,140
Travis is inventing a scenario with half-body glass cages.

940
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,740
Hey, you get me out of this.

941
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,140
No, you're a key member in this fart.

942
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,020
You're deep in it.

943
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,740
There's no extraction from here.

944
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,700
What are you and your brother talking about that you can't that he can't take

945
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,780
like a five minute break from the phone convo?

946
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,820
Yeah, it can't be that important.

947
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,180
That's where you say, hey, I'll call you right back.

948
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,900
I got a deuce.

949
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,700
Maybe when you call him, you say like, hi, I wanted to catch up,

950
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,260
but I just I want to know if you were going to have to duty in the next 15 minutes or so.

951
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,940
What's your battle situation currently?

952
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,580
When did you last evacuate?

953
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,940
Uh, tell your brother to do it right last because by 2015,

954
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,980
I think every call will be a video call, right?

955
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,900
I mean, we'll all have moved on to that tech.

956
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,380
Yeah, so he's not going to be able to sneak one in on you anymore.

957
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,700
Well, it doesn't sound like he's sneaking it.

958
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,140
It sounds like he's proud of it.

959
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,060
Yeah, it sounds like he's reveling.

960
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,260
What if he decorates the wall behind his toilet to look like some sort of cafe?

961
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,300
Oh, so you're saying like in in peewee's playhouse

962
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,380
that he pulls down the screen behind him.

963
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,980
Yes, he pulls it down and then you FaceTime with him.

964
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,540
And then you think, oh, he's at a trendy bistro.

965
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,460
So really, he's dropping, dropping child, getting it done, getting it.

966
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,260
I think that if you make a one, that's okay on the phone.

967
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,420
I think I think once he once he's more upsetting.

968
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah, because you can hear a onesie.

969
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,940
There's also the chance that he drops you in the toilet.

970
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,500
Mm hmm.

971
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,700
And then you're in his pee.

972
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,260
Guess what?

973
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,220
Your brother peed on you.

974
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:23,720
Oops.

975
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,080
Whoops.

976
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,040
Oops.

977
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,060
You have to kill yourself.

978
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,700
No, you're a dead man.

979
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,260
Now you're dead.

980
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,700
Dead man walking.

981
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,500
Hey, brother, stop, stop doing this.

982
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,180
Sorry.

983
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,140
No, not you.

984
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,180
Okay.

985
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,740
The email.

986
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,940
Me? Is it me?

987
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,860
I am happy to tell you guys that I have never made a bowel movement

988
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,140
while I've been on the phone with you.

989
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,100
While I have been podcasting with you.

990
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,940
That is a different story altogether.

991
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,140
Uh huh. Uh huh.

992
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,860
But as far as phone calls, direct one to one telephonic conversation,

993
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,580
no, no bathrooms.

994
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,620
So so you you've bathroomed while on the phone with the world,

995
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,260
but not individually with us.

996
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,740
Justin has made millions of people watch him as he uses the bathroom.

997
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,260
Well, Griffin, I otherwise I can't finish.

998
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,300
Okay, so.

999
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,860
Finish using the bathroom, I hope you mean, and not the other.

1000
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,900
Christ, I hope so.

1001
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,020
Hey, I recently introduced a friend of mine to your podcast.

1002
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,300
He loves it, but he's recently given me calls to question his taste.

1003
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
He has raised the subject of wanting to buy what he calls

1004
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,580
feety pajamas.

1005
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,860
The one piece sleepwear of children and crazy old men.

1006
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,900
I, a girl, find this to be terrible.

1007
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,820
And I'm hoping you guys can set him right.

1008
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,340
And that's from Concerned in Canada.

1009
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,420
He should get it.

1010
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:50,820
Get it.

1011
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,740
It's 20 does.

1012
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,300
Get it.

1013
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,460
Does it have rubber soles?

1014
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,340
Are the rubber soles and the fuzzy slippers on the bottom?

1015
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,100
I just I just want to throw this out because as I was listening to the question,

1016
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,020
I had the best image pop in my head and it's of this dude in feety pajamas.

1017
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,060
Just raging, girl.

1018
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,020
Does he have a big beard?

1019
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,860
Because in mine, he has a big beard.

1020
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,540
Yeah, my beard in mine.

1021
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,820
He's a half glass case in the top of his body and he can't can't adjust his feety pajamas.

1022
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,100
Oh, feety pajamas.

1023
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,220
That's a perfect example of when you can neither see nor touch your penis.

1024
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,660
OK, that's fair.

1025
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,700
Does it have what if it's a forever lazy and then there's the zipper in the front?

1026
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,580
Is there a flap in the back for his fanny to hang out of?

1027
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,580
Oh, that'd be adorable.

1028
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,700
Look at his little fanny.

1029
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,820
He's going to get a suntan.

1030
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,020
So he's got a big old beard and the flap is open and he's raging drunk.

1031
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,060
He's got a cute little fanny except he's 36 years old.

1032
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:49,540
And he's got a tattoo of Herve Villiches on his butt.

1033
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,020
I think if I could pull it off.

1034
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,180
I'm not sure I could pull it off.

1035
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,300
I think it would make me a little claustrophobic because I like my feet to be out there.

1036
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,860
Like I want them sometimes they want to go off on their own.

1037
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,380
They want to get out from under the blanket or peel off a sock or what have you.

1038
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,260
But I think if I could really commit to the look, I think it could be super cozy.

1039
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,180
Super cozy, I wonder what it seems like such a specific time that that would be appropriate.

1040
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,180
And that is when you are alone forever.

1041
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,140
Yeah, it doesn't seem like you could wear that to anything.

1042
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,940
Like if you had friends or family with you, you can't wear that.

1043
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,460
But you shouldn't be in your PJs with friends and family around anyway.

1044
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,940
Like you shouldn't be changing into those.

1045
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,740
Yeah, but if you're having like a lazy Sunday afternoon with a lover

1046
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,980
and you curl it up on the couch and you're watching Netflix.

1047
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,900
You just finished a session of lovemaking.

1048
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,740
You just finished making love and she's wearing some cute,

1049
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,660
literally anything other than one piece, feedie pajamas.

1050
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,740
And you roll up there in your one piece, feedie pajamas.

1051
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,820
The jig is up.

1052
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,980
Unless you turn it around backwards and the flaps on the front and your dick's hanging out.

1053
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,100
That's a worse look than the look that it could possibly be.

1054
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,260
That's a power move though.

1055
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,300
That is, she will know who is dominating that relationship and it is her.

1056
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,860
And then all you-

1057
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:19,460
Can that be the official uniform of the boner softball team?

1058
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,500
Yes, it can.

1059
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,540
My brother, my brother and me.

1060
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,780
Check it out.

1061
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,860
I think there's so many other sleepwear alternatives that are more comfortable.

1062
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,540
Cause feedie pajamas are just like a big fucking full body textile prison.

1063
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,660
Yeah.

1064
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,380
Can't get out of it.

1065
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,260
All it is, it's like a bathroom booby trap.

1066
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,940
All your smells, all your smells get trapped in there and they come out your neck.

1067
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,060
And you know what's right above your neck?

1068
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,340
Your nose.

1069
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,060
That's not gonna be good for you.

1070
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,380
What about a big shirt?

1071
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,860
Would you guys wear a night shirt?

1072
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,660
Yeah, I'd wear like an Ebenezer Scrooge style night shirt every day of my life, right?

1073
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,180
With that little bent over hat.

1074
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,260
Why are you wearing a hat to bed Ebenezer Scrooge?

1075
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,300
I'm in a pickle.

1076
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,420
My boss at my current job has a crush on me.

1077
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,860
This works out pretty well, generally, and she is fun to talk to.

1078
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,540
But, office ethics aside, I'm not attracted to her.

1079
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,140
I'm worried if I'm too forward in shooting her down, it may make working under her

1080
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,980
more complicated.

1081
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,220
What would a McElroy do in my shoes?

1082
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,340
Thanks from Dave in Accounting.

1083
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,820
Get it.

1084
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,380
Get it.

1085
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,660
Just get it.

1086
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,700
Get the brass ring.

1087
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,700
Full bore.

1088
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:44,180
I just, why don't you just say, I don't, I love you.

1089
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,380
Just tell her.

1090
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,900
I love you, but I'm not in love with you and can I get that promotion?

1091
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,980
Then you get me twice.

1092
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,620
Why do you have to?

1093
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,420
Then you get me twice.

1094
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,100
Why do you have to shoot her down at all?

1095
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,340
Yeah.

1096
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,180
She's your boss.

1097
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,980
She's the boss.

1098
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,900
That means if she says you're going out, you are.

1099
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,180
That's the way the world works, Dave.

1100
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
Otherwise it's insubordination.

1101
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,860
Dave.

1102
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,940
That kind of thing get you court-martialed, Dave.

1103
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,060
Make her, make you go out with her.

1104
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,500
Run that shit.

1105
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,460
Run that flagpole.

1106
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,980
Run that up HR's flagpole.

1107
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,340
Uh-huh, and then you, she gets fired.

1108
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,140
You get her job.

1109
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,580
You get it three times.

1110
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,780
Listen, you have a, you have a perfect out here and it's that you don't think it's ethical.

1111
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,700
Say, listen, girl, I want us to be together.

1112
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,140
I love your look.

1113
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,340
I love your style.

1114
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:46,980
I love your ways and your moves, but I can't, I can't two, two people who both work at TJ

1115
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:56,340
Maxx in the infant and mom section, they can't date each other because what if, what if it goes raw?

1116
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,780
But what if she loves you so much that like she quits her job and then you're just like,

1117
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,580
oh, I was kidding.

1118
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,180
Well, then she quits her job.

1119
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,900
She's not your boss.

1120
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,860
Problem solved.

1121
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,420
Oh, okay.

1122
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,980
I love it.

1123
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,540
It's win-win.

1124
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,140
Yeah, she can't make trouble.

1125
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,340
I mean, she could go out to the parking lot and slash your tires or something, but she

1126
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,260
can't make trouble for you in the office anymore.

1127
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:19,220
I'm upset about how you think of TJ Maxx as some sort of feudal hierarchy where the boss

1128
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,980
can make you an indentured servant.

1129
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,420
There's a tiered system.

1130
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,780
You're my dating slave.

1131
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,180
Yeah.

1132
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,260
I'm a, oh, I'm, I work at TJ Maxx.

1133
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:26,820
I'm a serf.

1134
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,860
It's great.

1135
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,540
The hours are awful and I have to marry whoever my boss tells me to, but it's okay because

1136
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,660
I get an acre of land.

1137
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,100
TJ Maxx named the business after himself.

1138
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,220
He's clearly a despot.

1139
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,540
So obviously.

1140
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,260
Right, exactly.

1141
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,820
There's a feudal system.

1142
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,140
Tiberius Jonas Maxx is an asshole.

1143
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,860
Yeah.

1144
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,820
I'm naming you.

1145
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,540
I'm naming you Lord of Incidentals.

1146
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,300
You shall be the ruler of all the intimate section.

1147
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,500
I was going to say that TJ Maxx is part of the 1%, but I don't think I've ever crossed

1148
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,100
the threshold of a TJ Maxx.

1149
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,700
Is that a ladies' store?

1150
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,300
It's like a-

1151
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,060
It's an everyone's store, Griffin.

1152
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,100
The thing I know about it is that they provided most of all the outfits from Sally Jessie

1153
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,820
Raphael.

1154
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,460
Oh, okay.

1155
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,620
So most of her clothing came from TJ Maxx.

1156
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,300
A lot of good looks on that show, so.

1157
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,340
Yeah.

1158
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,300
And those glasses?

1159
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:19,460
Yeah.

1160
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,420
Don't mind if I do.

1161
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,060
I'll take two.

1162
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,900
I'll take four because I want to do it in 20 Does.

1163
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:30,100
Speaking of 20 Does, this has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

1164
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,740
modern era.

1165
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:37,940
Thank you so much for listening and for fjording into the next year with us by your side.

1166
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,180
So much more good stuff to come.

1167
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:46,180
We had an amazing 2011 because, mainly because of you guys at home listening to us.

1168
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,540
We got to do some live shows.

1169
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,580
We'll do some more this year.

1170
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:55,540
I'm sure of it, but thank you for all your support and spreading the word to friends

1171
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,420
and everything.

1172
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,860
It means a lot.

1173
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,740
It means a lot to me.

1174
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,260
It means a lot to me, I guess.

1175
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,020
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for letting us use their song, It's

1176
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,140
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which is it still $5?

1177
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,940
I saw a tweet somewhere that said it was $5 somewhere.

1178
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,740
It was $5.

1179
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,460
I don't know.

1180
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,900
Let me check while you're doing your announcements.

1181
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,540
Just buy it.

1182
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,180
No matter what.

1183
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,780
It doesn't matter what the price is.

1184
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,260
Just buy it.

1185
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,220
It doesn't need to be $5.

1186
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,420
It's so good.

1187
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,260
It's worth upwards of like $8.

1188
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,740
Yeah.

1189
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,660
And you're, well, what?

1190
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,460
Maybe more.

1191
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:25,940
I would say.

1192
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,740
I don't know how money works.

1193
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,380
I would say it's worth it.

1194
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,180
I personally paid $15 for it and have not regretted it.

1195
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,580
I bought the CD, and then I bought it on vinyl.

1196
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,300
So I spent at least $45 on that record.

1197
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,940
Whoa.

1198
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,940
For $45 and a lot of credibility.

1199
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah.

1200
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,780
Just buy a CD already.

1201
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,580
It was on Amazon.

1202
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,820
It was on the Amazon Streamys.

1203
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1204
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,420
They're streamers.

1205
