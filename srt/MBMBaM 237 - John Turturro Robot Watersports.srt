1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,960
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Are you ready for some football?

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
Hey guys, it's me, it's us. Football bobcat Goldthwait?

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,760
No, mine, it's me, it's Bosephus. Hank Williams, uh, Hank Williams Jr.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,480
Hank Williams Jr. It's me, Hank Williams Jr.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,440
Hank Williams, quote, Bosephus Jr. Bosephus, Henry to my friends.

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,760
Are you ready for some football? How many names do you have?

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm very worried about you, Mr. Williams. You sound like you're coming down with something.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,440
Have you been inhaling sulfur? I am coming down with something.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,080
I'm coming down with football fever. Are you ready for some football?

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,160
It's gonna be a party. Mr. Williams,

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,840
could you explain to Justin that he still has to record an hour-long show after this?

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
He shouldn't fry his voice. If you were doing anything.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,760
Listen, it's Super Bowl Sunday, let me sing my fucking song.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,880
Are you ready for some football? Bosephus, to put this in terms that you can-

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
Just once, can I get through the fucking song?

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,120
I just want to warn you that just in football, like, terminology,

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
this is just like the the beginning of the first inning,

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
and you don't want to, you don't want to blow out your treasure.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Are you ready for some football?

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
Why do you sound like Anibal?

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,160
You know, I can stop doing the fucking voice a lot quicker if you let me get through my

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,600
goddamn song. Once. Just once. Once. Once. Once.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,560
Once. Will you get him next time, Gadget?

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,680
Are you ready for some football? It's gonna be a party.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,840
Gotta toss the great iron around, make sure everybody touches it.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Because if all of your players don't touch the ball, then you're never gonna win the game.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah, everybody get it. What are we doing for this play, Peyton Manning?

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Well, I think we're just gonna sort of pass the ball around and just sort of

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,680
hand, make sure everybody gets a hand on it, or else the score, the score won't count.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
That would be, I would say that would be an awesome trick play if they all just formed

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
around the ball, right? Everybody had a hand on it, and it was just like a wheel,

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
you know, extending out from the ball. And as people tried to dive, they're just like

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
bouncing off the backs of all the players, like, we can't even get to the ball.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
What's Peyton doing? Like, this is genius.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,920
Listen, you guys are having a lot of fun, but I got an embarrassing confession.

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,640
I do not, even on a surface level, understand the rules.

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
So the answer to, are you ready for some football, is because I am not.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,000
It's categorical now.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Because I am not prepared for football whatsoever. You know, here's a fun fact,

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,360
can I tell you a fun fact?

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,680
Please.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,760
For about a week, while I was writing it, that song had a reference to hitting the net.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,800
So my banjo player was having some fun with me. His name was Dan Joe.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Dan Joe.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,400
Dan Joe the banjo player.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,320
Dan Joe player was his name.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,840
Was the net in reference attached to the-

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,240
Good man! He was a good man, though.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,800
When the kicker warms up, I guess he kicks into a net. Is that what it was in reference to?

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,560
I had to let Dan Joe go in the mid-2000s. He got the arthritis.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah, you can't have-

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,240
Sorry, what was the question? What was your question about touchdown?

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
Uh, I was just wondering how one passes the gridiron route.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Well, you just, uh, you know, the laces out.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, okay.

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Bocevis.

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
What's up, Brian? Are you ready?

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Yeah, man, I wish you had been here last week when we decided that that was going to be our

66
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
football episode, and that next week we'd have to come up with something clever and original, but-

67
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
Well, my agent was supposed to get me on that one.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah.

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
And he dropped the ball so bad. My agent is Dan Joe player.

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,480
I had to find a place for him in the organization after the arthritis.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Did he drop the ball because of the arthritis?

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
He can't top an email worth a goddamn.

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Man, arthritis has really sort of ravaged your life, huh?

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
Yes, it has. Well, it is.

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,480
That ugly disease has really sort of turned your whole career around.

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,200
Well, Dan Joe's career, and by extension mine, he's such a key player, you know?

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Hank, Hank, be honest with me, is Dan Joe player your Chris Gaines?

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
Please, Henry, we're friends.

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,480
Wait, you want a more formal name because we're friends?

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,520
Please, my nickname is for business acquaintances.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,880
It's Henronicus, please.

82
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
Henronicus Bocevis Williams Jr., the junior, the third.

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
Bocevis, thanks for stopping by the show. Sorry that your life is so miserable.

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Absolutely fine, man.

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
This is the highlight of my week. I can't believe we're done already.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,800
I just don't think you deserve the plight, the hand you've been dealt,

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
but, you know, sometimes that's just how it goes.

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them, right?

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
Right, Bocevis?

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Is that a football reference? I don't understand. Is there folding?

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,200
Yes.

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,920
Can you fold?

93
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
If you're hit hard enough.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
If you're hit hard enough, you almost certainly will.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,760
Well, listen, guys, this has been Real Treat.

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:05,520
Want to ask everybody to get out to iTunes and get my new CD, Hank on Hank.

97
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,520
It's a spoken word album, I believe.

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,080
It's a spoken word album where I just recount, it's just stories from the road,

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
set to music, my music.

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Arthritic stories, essentially, is what we're dealing with.

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Listen, I gotta roll, but you guys have been so awesome.

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
Country Boy can survive. South's gonna rise again.

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
Okay, you're fading away, it sounds like a little bit.

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
Listen, it's been a great run, everybody.

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Okay.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
Thank you so much.

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you.

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Are you ready for some football?

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,360
Feel better.

110
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Monday night party!

111
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,280
And there he goes off into the sunset.

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
He does know the Super Bowl's on Sunday, right?

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,640
Yeah, Travis, will you text Justin and just make sure that he can stop by for any party?

114
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm really afraid that Hank Williams killed Justin.

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
Sorry, guys.

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,280
Hank Williams had me locked up in his rock and roll trunk, is what he called it.

117
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
What else was in there?

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
Oh, in there?

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,800
Yeah.

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,760
Okay, this is gonna sound weird, but there was a corpse of a man who looked like an

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,600
arthritic banjo player, which sounds weird to me.

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't know how I knew that.

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,960
Well, maybe I'll tell you all about it when you're older.

124
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay, I'll be happy to do that.

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm the oldest brother.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,840
Hi.

127
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,320
Did you say it's a show about the modern era and all that stuff?

128
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
Yeah, I did that shit at the very beginning.

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,120
Are you ready to start recording?

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Yeah, let's do the count to sync up and we'll just sort of roll from there.

131
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Okay.

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Hey, everybody, it's Justin McElroy.

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
It's my brother, my brother, and me.

134
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Let's skip the introductions this week.

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
I feel froggy.

136
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
Let's jump right into the advice.

137
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
Do you feel froggy because you just spoke like fucking Yoda for like six minutes?

138
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
Oh, you mean Hank Williams Jr.?

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,040
No, I'm a different person from him, but how's your object permanent?

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not good.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
It's bad, yeah.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
I closed the webcam window in Skype and then suddenly the two of you didn't exist anymore.

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
I slipped and fell in the ice a few weeks ago and hurt my wrist.

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
Ever since then, it hurts to shake hands with people.

145
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
My banjo career is over.

146
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
Also, I'm a corpse.

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
I'm a corpse in a box.

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,400
Help.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,880
Do you have any recommendations for ways I can avoid shaking hands until it gets better

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
without having to tell them the whole story?

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,040
That's from Shaken Up in Philadelphia.

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,480
Why are you afraid to tell people that story?

153
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
That's not an embarrassing story.

154
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,400
I mean, if people saw it, it's embarrassing, but that's not like you didn't slip and fall

155
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,680
in the ice because you were distracted because you were jerking it, I'm assuming.

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,040
It wasn't like you hurt your wrist because you wiped your butt at a weird angle.

157
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,840
That would actually be a very embarrassing story.

158
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,800
What if you did that?

159
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,840
What if you were wiping and just snapped?

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,080
No, not like this.

161
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Not again.

162
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
What do you even do?

163
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
You can't use the other hand.

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,640
Could you put on an air cast and wear that everywhere so people go to shake your hand

165
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
just kind of, ugh, this thing, and then point to it with your head like, ugh, this.

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
Can't shake.

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
This, ugh.

168
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,600
You know how it goes.

169
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,360
This is one of many, many social problems that could be fixed if we Americans would

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,400
just sort of adopt the beautiful practice of face kissing upon greeting.

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Or just a light bow.

173
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,640
Yeah, sure.

174
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
It's 2015.

175
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
It's time to start doing things in the Japanese style.

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
You know, that's my jam.

177
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,840
So I think maybe it's time to fold them when you meet somebody.

178
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,560
No need to tie them.

179
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, you got to know when to hold them, and you got to know when to fold them.

180
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
You got to know when to hold a hand.

181
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
There's a Japanese tradition that you learn if you're in the games industry that when

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
someone hands you a business card or a card of any sort, you should accept with two hands,

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
and it's a very big deal.

184
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,000
And I know this.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
You spend 15 minutes reading it and admiring the lettering.

186
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:01,200
And then last week, I was purchasing a carryout order at a local Japanese establishment,

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,760
and the woman behind the counter took my card with both hands, and I felt so angry that

188
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,760
I was not able to put my one area of cultural literacy to practice.

189
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,720
Can you imagine how fucking impressed she would have been if I'd handed it to her with two

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,040
hands?

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,080
She would have been like, wow.

192
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,600
Wow.

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,160
What did you do?

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,840
You just sort of like fucking slid it across the table and fucking gambit?

195
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,880
I flipped it at her head.

196
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
No, I just kind of, you know how you do.

197
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,360
Almost embarrassed that you don't have cash here, this.

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm the worst.

200
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
I'm the worst.

201
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah, bow, I think.

202
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Or salute.

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah, there's all kinds of options.

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,720
Don't feel like your hands are tied, because that would probably hurt too.

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,520
I gotta say, if someone reaches their extensor, hands for a handshake, and then you salute,

206
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,520
they are going to have you in prison.

207
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,800
What if you do all of them?

208
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Could you just say something like, I've been sick.

209
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,760
I shouldn't.

210
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
Like, then you don't have to tell the whole story.

211
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,680
You don't just shake their hand.

212
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Let me hit you with this.

213
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,960
They hold out your hand, their hand.

214
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,400
They hold out their hand.

215
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
And you salute.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Then they hold out your hand.

217
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,760
Nope.

218
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,240
You salute, and you bow, and while you're down there, you kiss their hand.

219
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,400
That's an option.

220
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
Listen, America's a melting pot.

221
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Not in the regal sense, where you take it, and you kiss the ring or whatever.

222
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
You just sort of kiss the top of their extended palm.

223
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
The problem here is the conversation that follows.

224
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
I would shake, but I fell and hurt my hand, and it really hurts to shake.

225
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,240
So you broke it?

226
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
No, I'm just over here.

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
I just kind of ouchied it.

228
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,840
I kind of ouchied it.

229
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,640
I stoved it, to use that colloquialism.

230
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,600
I stoved it.

231
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
Kind of an ouchie, and now I can't.

232
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
Oh, when they reach out, they'll say like, no, I shouldn't.

233
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,840
I just farted on my hand.

234
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,480
No, well, that would be like a hundred times worse.

235
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Way worse.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,600
I think you'd just be up front and just say that you made a boo-boo nanny

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,880
while you were walking on the street.

238
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,400
It's fucking-

239
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
I made a whoopsie daisy.

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,840
It's February.

241
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Shit's slick out there.

242
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
People be making boo-boo nannies all the time.

243
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
24-7 boo-boo nannies.

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,520
I made a boom-boom on the street across from here.

245
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,080
That's a different thing.

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Again, another bad thing.

247
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,640
Boo-boo nannies.

248
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,000
Is a boom-boom bad?

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
Boom-boom means he pooped on the street.

250
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
It means he pooped on the street.

251
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,000
Why aren't you guys helping me get boo-boo nannies started?

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
Because it sounds like a terrible TLC reality show.

253
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm trying to fucking pollinate our listeners' brain fields

254
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,880
with boo-boo nanny to try and get it going

255
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
for when people make a whoopsie daisy.

256
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,080
I was distracted because I was actually filing the trademark paperwork

257
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,240
on a boo-boo nanny to make sure-

258
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
I was pitching it into it.

259
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
I was pitching it to E.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
It's a good word.

261
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

262
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,440
I need to check boo-boo nanny.com super quick though.

263
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,680
Okay.

264
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
How are you spelling it?

265
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,000
Like phonetic?

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
B-O-O-N-A-N-Y.

267
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,280
Imagine this.

269
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
Honey boo-boo, right?

270
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
She needs a babysitter.

271
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,120
You get a super rich woman who's a little bit like

272
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
she's been tossed out by her parents.

273
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
So she needs the money because she's never had to get a job before.

274
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
So she's the boo-boo nanny.

275
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
That young woman's television career is over.

276
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
Do you guys want to Yahoo though?

277
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, absolutely.

278
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
Can you do me one favor really quick and just take your game

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
and then recognize this game from Rachel Sperling.

280
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,600
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

281
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,040
Oh, I know that game.

282
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Steve, who asks,

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,160
if you had the chance to go to bedrock and live in a cartoon world

284
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,280
but could not come back, would you do it?

285
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,920
Update.

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,720
And of course you would be an animated cartoon character as well.

287
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
Maybe a friend of the Flintstones and maybe not.

288
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,120
Well.

289
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,720
Oh, hold on.

290
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,720
All right.

291
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
What kind of world are you pitching where basically you have to live

292
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
in a cartoon caveman era and also you don't know the Flintstones.

293
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
So you're not really on the show.

294
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,320
It just strikes me that there's so many bitter

295
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
like animated worlds to want to be a part of.

296
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,360
Like that's why I proposed this question.

297
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,280
I mean, let's respect the source material with bedrock.

298
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,880
Would I leave my entire life?

299
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
Would I leave my wife behind and my house and my cat

300
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,480
and my group of friends here in Austin to go live in fucking bedrock?

301
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,640
No.

302
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,760
To what end?

303
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,520
I will say whenever I see the intro and he gets that like giant ass

304
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
rack of dinosaur ribs to watch the drive-in movie,

305
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,880
I always think like I would actually I would,

306
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,640
oh my God, I would fuck those ribs up.

307
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
But I don't think that I would love those ribs

308
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
the way that I love my, you know, my wife.

309
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I think we can all agree that those giant ribs

310
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
are the only plus of living in bedrock.

311
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
Other than that, you have animals running your sink,

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
your vacuum cleaner, your lamps.

313
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
Oh, and also one thing that you forgot, Travis,

314
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
is that there's fucking dinosaurs everywhere.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Including in your home.

316
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
In your home.

317
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,520
You've got to push your car around with your fucking feet.

318
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,640
And even if they don't bite you, the smell probably isn't great.

319
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
That's something that people don't like think about

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
when we watch the new Jurassic World trailer.

321
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
It's like, oh, Chris Pratt, I love that guy.

322
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,680
Oh, and he's running with some velociraptors.

323
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,320
I bet that's fun.

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Yeah, but think about it.

325
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
Those things probably smell like shit.

326
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,840
Yeah.

327
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,320
T-Rex, T-Rex with those arms, he's not cleaning himself.

328
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,360
He does not have a good clean.

329
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,840
His, from the tail to his tummy,

330
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,720
that whole region is gonna stink horrifically.

331
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,840
Have you guys thought about the fact

332
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,080
that like their cars are made out of fucking rocks?

333
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,160
And so if you put like four like adults into that car,

334
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,640
that car probably weighs like five tons

335
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
and you're pushing it with your feet.

336
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
That's the worst.

337
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,480
Yeah, I know.

338
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,280
You might as well walk at that point.

339
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,520
Yeah.

340
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,480
Yeah.

341
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
Like, forget about the dinosaurs.

342
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,320
Can you talk about the fact that you're giving up

343
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
your entire life to a world where like,

344
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,960
they can't even treat disease.

345
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,680
Yeah, they can't.

346
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,880
It's like, yabba-dabba, I have chicken pox, I'm gonna die.

347
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,360
Goodbye.

348
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,000
That's it.

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,520
And now we all have chicken pox.

350
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,240
Later.

351
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
PS, we all have chicken pox.

352
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,240
What's never made explicitly clear is that on the show,

353
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
by the way, Christ hasn't come to earth yet,

354
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
so I'm going to go to hell.

355
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
Where are the scenes where Fred's sacrificing something

356
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,760
to their pagan god, Bale?

357
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,720
You know what I mean?

358
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
Yeah, right.

359
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,680
Right.

360
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
And what they don't show is that on the show,

361
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,760
Fred and Wilma and Barney, all of them are 12,

362
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,920
because the life expectancy is like 15.

363
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,400
Quick question before we-

364
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
This is not applicable.

365
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,160
Quick question.

366
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
Is the world of Bedrock,

367
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
does anybody know where I'm going with this already?

368
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,600
No.

369
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Is it part of the extended universe

370
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,400
of the dinosaurs television show?

371
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,320
No, I cannot imagine that dinosaurs and humans

372
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
were coexisting in either, like in the dinosaurs fiction,

373
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
where they'd become sentient and flannel wearing.

374
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
I cannot imagine humans were also in the mix.

375
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm going to throw something else into the mix.

376
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,880
You ready for this?

377
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah, sure.

378
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,800
This is canon, because this is from the theme song.

379
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,720
What if there was an episode, a deleted lost episode,

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,200
where Fred climbed out of the valley that they lived in

381
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,080
to discover it was like the year 1998?

382
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,520
Because here's the thing, you guys.

383
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,800
They're a modern Stone Age family.

384
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,480
A modern Stone Age family.

385
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,080
So they're living in this valley of lost time, right?

386
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,040
Oh, shit.

387
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,200
Now, that's how they have record players,

388
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
because they didn't have record players back then.

389
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
The only way that would work is if that was modern day,

390
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,040
they were just all living a fucking village lifestyle,

391
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,440
where they were all with dinosaurs and everything.

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
Think about it.

393
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
Are you saying that if you zoomed out of the Flintstones,

394
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,920
you would see the modern world surrounding it?

395
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
They've been in the bubble this whole time?

396
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
Yeah, they're like in the middle of like Utah,

397
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
like a Utahian desert.

398
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
Occasionally, people with modern technology

399
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
like hover within range of the bubble,

400
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
and they'd see it and try to replicate it out of stone.

401
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,000
And then they'd get like, what you don't see in every scene

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
of the Flintstones, like for the record player,

403
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,480
they use it and then they get furious,

404
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
because it doesn't work,

405
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
because it might as well be made out of Play-Doh,

406
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
because it's rocks, and they smash it on the ground furious.

407
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,560
Oh, what they don't show is it's like a Truman show

408
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,680
like thing, right?

409
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,600
Where they've been given this and it's like,

410
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,240
almost like when they make enclosures for like gorillas,

411
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
and they're like, we're gonna try to replicate

412
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
what their real lives would have been like.

413
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
But like, these people don't know

414
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
what ancient times would have been like.

415
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
So they're like, they would have like stone record players.

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,040
That'd be crazy, right?

417
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,600
No, it wouldn't work.

418
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Bam Bam goes to the corner store to buy some rolling papers

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
and hands the cashier some clams,

420
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,640
and the cashier's like, thanks.

421
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
And then Bam Bam leaves, and the cashier's like,

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
wait, these are clams.

423
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Why is this our currency?

424
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
Like, why have we attached any value to clams?

425
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,040
What the fuck?

426
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,440
We eat these.

427
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
But then he's dragged away.

428
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,800
He's dragged away by the producers.

429
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,640
And there's a finite amount of water in the bubble,

430
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,320
of course, obviously.

431
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,720
So they all know they have about five years.

432
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,320
Oh, fuck, Utopia 2, Flintstones, Utopia 2.

433
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,440
What if they could do Utopia,

434
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
but the people in Utopia don't know they're in Utopia?

435
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah, fuck.

436
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,000
Ugh.

437
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,680
Fox, we could have saved that shit.

438
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
So that's a definite no.

439
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Would not leave life behind.

440
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,360
Four bedrock.

441
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
Sorry, Wilma.

442
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,280
Sorry, Fred.

443
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,040
Will say, though, if I get the opportunity

444
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
to pop into Pokemon Town, bye.

445
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Bye, life.

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,000
See you, Earth.

447
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,920
Where did Griffin go?

448
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,400
I miss him.

449
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,120
He's my husband.

450
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,680
Where did he go?

451
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
He's been Poke-raptured.

452
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,160
Let's turn on WB at 9 a.m. on Saturday.

453
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,640
Wait a minute.

454
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,360
There he is.

455
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Kicking it with Charizard.

456
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
Kicking it with Blastoise.

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
The happiest he's ever been.

458
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,160
What a cruel joke.

459
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Bet you can't.

460
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,120
I can't.

461
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,080
I love you.

462
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
I love the two of you very dearly.

463
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
You're my brothers, and I love this podcast we do together.

464
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
I think we're helping a lot of people

465
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,480
and changing a lot of lives,

466
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
and it's brought a tremendous amount of joy in my life.

467
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
I would leave it forever to spend.

468
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,040
In a second.

469
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,000
I would do it.

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,920
I would jump into Pokemon World

471
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,200
if by jumping into Pokemon World,

472
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,040
my human, like, fleshy body could only survive for a month.

473
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,840
I would trade the rest of my life

474
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
and all that entails here on Earth

475
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
for one sweet month in Pallet Town.

476
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
Goodbye, you fucks.

477
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,560
You go skydiving.

478
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,120
You went Rocky Mountain climbing.

479
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,440
You went 2.7 seconds on a Hitmonchan.

480
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
Oh man, I would do it.

481
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
Because I could knock out that.

482
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I could become the very best,

483
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
like, no one ever was in a month, I think.

484
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
And then I would, you know.

485
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,520
Fade away.

486
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,240
You're not gonna fade away.

487
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,040
You're gonna burn bright.

488
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,240
Climb the stage.

489
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,480
Yeah.

490
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,600
I'll never forget when the mysterious fleshy stranger

491
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,880
rolled into town.

492
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
He was only with us for a month, but.

493
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,920
He's three-dimensional.

494
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,760
His team was so well-balanced, though.

495
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
He was all squidgy and pinchable.

496
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,160
Fingernails.

497
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,760
And then he died, which was a whole new concept for us.

498
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
And we were like, how do we bury this?

499
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
What do we do with this now?

500
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,800
We're gonna have to form some sort of religion now,

501
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,240
just to deal with death.

502
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,680
No one's ever died before.

503
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,360
Is he gonna turn into a ghostly?

504
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,320
Alright, we're done.

505
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
Griffin's fallen asleep.

506
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,800
Revive.

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,160
Revive.

508
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,240
Revive.

509
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,080
Let me take this kid to the Pokemon Center.

510
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

511
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,760
I don't know.

512
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
We don't have human doctors.

513
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,120
What if in Pokemon World.

514
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
Oh boy, this is the episode now.

515
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,200
Medical care for Pokemon is free,

516
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
but humans pay out the notes.

517
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
Oh my God, it's crazy.

518
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,480
Yeah, Obamacare only extends to Pokemon.

519
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay.

520
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,320
No, I think we got a good four and a half hours out of that.

521
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
Brothers, how do I shake an acquaintance

522
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,800
who wants to escalate things to the friendship level?

523
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
It's a girl at my gym who often asks me to hang out.

524
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
I'm a friendly gal, but I find her a little odd.

525
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
And I'm just not interested in being friends, IRL.

526
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,040
I've always made excuses and declined her invitations,

527
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,640
but she keeps asking.

528
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Okay, I run into her a few times a week

529
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
and I'm running out of pretend stuff to do.

530
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
Is there any way to give her a more permanent brush off

531
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,560
with minimal awkwardness?

532
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,720
I can't.

533
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,160
I've got a thing in Portland.

534
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,400
Oh man, that's tricky, isn't it?

535
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,120
This is tough.

536
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,560
Okay, I will say that this situation

537
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,120
that this person's in has not happened to me

538
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
for like five years.

539
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,920
So somewhere locked inside the codex that is my existence

540
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,760
is the answer to this question.

541
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,280
And we just have to, we just have to clue sew it out.

542
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
Let me see if I can crack the code.

543
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Is it because you just stay in your house

544
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
and play Destiny all day and you never have, yeah?

545
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I mean, that's one of the things that helps.

546
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,800
I think that this is one of those frustrating things

547
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,480
about everybody wants to think that they'll get the hint.

548
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,800
And by saying like, oh, you know, I can't.

549
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,560
Oh, I gotta do this thing.

550
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,880
And you do that like 10 times, it's like, surely.

551
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
Surely they know that if I wanted to,

552
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
I would have made this thing.

553
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Except that like people who ask you 10 times

554
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,040
and you keep making excuses aren't those people.

555
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,480
Aren't the people who get the hint.

556
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,960
And so one of two ways, you either need to say like,

557
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,640
listen, my schedule is just really busy

558
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
and I don't think that like I'm gonna have any free time

559
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,160
in it like I'm working on this new project or whatever

560
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,560
and I'm just gonna be booked up for like ever.

561
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
Or stop going to the gym.

562
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,760
Can I bounce this idea off you guys

563
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,880
and just see how it sticks?

564
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,960
Like the older I get, the more I come to realize

565
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
that one of the most important characteristics

566
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,080
of a good friend,

567
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
not the most important characteristic, right?

568
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,800
You have to like get along on that special level

569
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,960
and be genuinely interested in and care about each other.

570
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
That's the most important thing.

571
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
But the older I get, like the more important it becomes

572
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,320
a trait for like a friend of mine to have

573
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,040
is to just not be a complete fucking flake.

574
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,640
Is to actually like want to do stuff,

575
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,280
want to spend time with me, want to like,

576
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,920
and when we make plans like stick with them,

577
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
like a fair sort of trade off between who comes up

578
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
with the plans but like both of you getting excited

579
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
about it and doing it.

580
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,920
Like all of the friends that I have now are like that.

581
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,080
They're really, really good about that actually.

582
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
But I've definitely like shed some friends

583
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
that didn't do that because it's, I don't know,

584
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
it's like the, it's the worst.

585
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,440
So, I mean, this person wanting to spend time with you,

586
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,200
I don't know.

587
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,920
I think that seems like actually a pretty dope trait.

588
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,480
And if you're uncomfortable about it,

589
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
maybe you just need to get to know them better.

590
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
This could be your, we could have like a Kirsten Coe

591
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
and Julie Cooper situation on our hands

592
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,560
where you don't know that you're supposed

593
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
to be best friends forever.

594
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,680
But then four seasons later, there you are.

595
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,880
But if I can counterpoint that, Griffin,

596
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
like I would say that what's funny about this

597
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,800
is if you put it in a different context

598
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,640
and put it in like a dating context

599
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
and you went on like four or five dates with someone

600
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
and like you just weren't interested

601
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
in taking it to the next level,

602
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,360
or somebody was asking you out that you knew,

603
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
it's way easier to say like,

604
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,040
oh no, I don't wanna go out with this person

605
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
because I'm not interested in them.

606
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,440
But this has, this has,

607
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
this situation has none of the baggage associated

608
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
with what you just described.

609
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,240
It's literally a person that you have had,

610
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
you know, moderate exposure to saying,

611
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,080
hey, you seem like a cool person.

612
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm gonna come up with plans for stuff if you wanna,

613
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,560
like, I don't know, I would go get a drink with this person.

614
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,720
But if you're not friend-tracted to them,

615
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,600
like why do it?

616
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
Why like give them that false sense of like,

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,680
oh yeah, now we're buddies.

618
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,200
Friend-tracted is not a fucking thing.

619
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,160
Like I have friends, like dear, dear friends

620
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,040
that I didn't like,

621
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
like the first few times that we hung out,

622
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
like I just didn't like get to know them.

623
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
And I have really good friends

624
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,480
that I sort of thought I was sort of

625
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
like characteristically opposed to

626
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,560
because they're so different from the people

627
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,680
I typically hang out with.

628
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,560
And then, you know, I hung out with them a few times

629
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
and not only did like we become very dear friends,

630
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,360
but I changed.

631
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,080
Like my perception of what people I dig on,

632
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
like the people that I like to associate with

633
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,560
completely changed because this person changed it.

634
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,600
Like I think the more you can sort of expose yourself

635
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,240
to people like that,

636
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,560
the better your life is gonna be.

637
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,760
Well, okay, so I'll say this.

638
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,800
I think that going out for like a drink with this person

639
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,280
benefits you in two ways.

640
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
One, maybe Griffin's right.

641
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,800
Maybe you do end up like, oh, you know what?

642
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
We'd only ever talked in like a gym setting

643
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
in this weird like public setting.

644
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440
Yeah, it turns out that like I actually do like this

645
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
or it puts you in the position

646
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
that since you at least gave it a shot,

647
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
it's way easier, especially on your conscious

648
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
and conscience to then say like, okay,

649
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
you know, I'm really busy, I can't.

650
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
And you don't have to come up with elaborate things

651
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
because you already gave it a shot and it wasn't great.

652
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,560
You didn't like it, then like.

653
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Yeah, why don't you just try it?

654
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Just try it.

655
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,760
You're not, you're not.

656
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Unless she's a serial killer.

657
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,880
You're probably gonna be fine.

658
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,360
Obviously, like if it's like a danger situation

659
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,200
and you know what you're doing,

660
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
but like, I don't know.

661
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
I can't imagine myself ever being in a position

662
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
where like I don't wanna make any more friends.

663
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
And I don't know, I don't wanna come off

664
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
like on my high horse saying,

665
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
you should be friends with everyone.

666
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
But I definitely think it's like,

667
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
I think everybody's, you know, worth a shot.

668
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,840
You should have a kid.

669
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Once you have a kid, you will be shocked

670
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,960
at how quickly that mode switches to just like

671
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
the plane is going down

672
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,480
and you're throwing friends off like weighty cargo,

673
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,280
just trying to keep some semblance of a social life afloat.

674
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
You will be surprised how quickly that changes.

675
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
Well, okay.

676
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
Oh, there you go.

677
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,880
Trust me.

678
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Give it a shot.

679
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
Give it a shot.

680
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,920
What could it hurt?

681
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,600
Y'all wanna know Yahoo?

682
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,640
Sure, sure.

683
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
I'll make it a quick one.

684
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,840
I'll make it a quick one so we can get to that money zone.

685
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,280
My favorite part of the show.

686
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,000
The money part of it.

687
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
Tasty, tasty money zone.

688
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,800
This one was sent in by,

689
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,040
oh, game recognize that goddamn game again,

690
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,760
Rachel Sperling.

691
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,080
Thank you.

692
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Snuggly Duckling, who asks,

693
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
if you could recolor an animal,

694
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,520
what would you recolor and to what color?

695
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
Okay, hold on.

696
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
Okay, give me one more time.

697
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
If you could recolor an animal,

698
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
and what would you recolor and to what color?

699
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
Let me hit you guys just because I know you're percolating.

700
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,040
I've had some time to percolate already.

701
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
I would probably-

702
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,640
By the way, a quick bit of my brother and my brother made trivia.

703
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,040
Okay.

704
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,800
When one of us says, can you read it again just so I can try to,

705
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,080
that means we weren't listening.

706
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,560
Correct.

707
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,160
I was checking my Facebook messages.

708
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Oh, terrific.

709
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
At least it was something important,

710
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,120
yeah, and not something completely menial.

711
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
That shit wouldn't wait.

712
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
And meaningless.

713
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
I would do alligators, I think,

714
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,040
because I've never seen an alligator and been like, perfect.

715
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,640
You know what I mean?

716
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,600
Every time I see an alligator,

717
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
it's like your shit looks kind of modeled

718
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,160
and I'm not super crazy about it.

719
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,560
And that goes for the stark white ones with the red eyes.

720
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,080
Fuck those guys.

721
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,120
What would you change it to?

722
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,880
What about bright cherry red, like a hot flaming red?

723
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,440
Okay, extinct.

724
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,320
They're extinct.

725
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
Just like that, they're extinct.

726
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:25,680
Why?

727
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,040
They've lost their natural camouflage

728
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,400
that they use in the swamps to hunt.

729
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,680
They're bright and obvious.

730
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,200
You just killed all the alligators.

731
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
Of what's killing alligators?

732
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
Hey, can I ask a question?

733
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,760
Other than hippos, which as we all know,

734
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
can swallow alligators whole,

735
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,920
what's killing alligators?

736
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,480
They die of starvation.

737
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,840
They're fucking starving, Griffin,

738
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,400
because everything's like, oh, hey,

739
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,480
there's a fucking bright red alligator over there.

740
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm just going to move over here.

741
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
It's just going to have to work.

742
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh, it's just going to have to work a little bit harder on it.

743
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
And honestly, guys, if we're being honest,

744
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,760
I think that reducing the population of alligators,

745
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,920
I think it's time that somebody took them down a peg.

746
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,720
Just to be clear, you want to thin the alligator herd

747
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,440
to a smaller, more refined crop of bright red super hunters.

748
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,160
That's what you want, like the Corvette of murderers.

749
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,640
You're out on the golf course in the Keys, right?

750
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,680
And you see an alligator and your day's fucking ruined, right?

751
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,760
My solution is to reduce the alligator population by about 90%.

752
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
So you're going to have way less of those encounters.

753
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,560
But when you do encounter an alligator, you're dead.

754
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, that's one of Griffin's bright red super killer alligators.

755
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,400
They're perfect hunters, and they will eat fucking anything.

756
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,080
Okay, and for those people, I'm sorry.

757
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
Yeah, I fucked you.

758
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,920
I fucked you real good.

759
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,160
I fucked you right in that gator's mouth is what I did.

760
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,920
But for the millions of lives that I helped

761
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
by reducing the number of alligator sightings

762
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,440
on the golf courses in the Keys,

763
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
those people paid a lot of money for tea time.

764
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
They are going to have themselves a really great day

765
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
drinking their shandy out on the holes.

766
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,080
And then maybe one of them gets eaten by a super gator.

767
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,960
But for those other people, a clean, very calm golfing session.

768
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,080
And that's my gift to the world.

769
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,960
You're welcome.

770
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,160
You know what mine would be?

771
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,560
What's that?

772
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,440
I would make all spiders really bright glow in the dark.

773
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,560
Okay, so sort of the same principle a little bit?

774
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
Yeah, because I fucking hate spiders,

775
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,920
and I'd really like to know if they were on me in the dark.

776
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,080
See, for me, ignorance is bliss vis-a-vis spiders.

777
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,600
I know they're everywhere.

778
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,640
I live in Texas.

779
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,080
There are fucking scorpions here,

780
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,680
and them and the spiders are just fighting

781
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
constantly a secret war in my yard.

782
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,960
I just, I would kind of not.

783
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
I feel like if that happened, Travis,

784
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,040
your room would be iridescent

785
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,640
because there's spiders like secretly everywhere.

786
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,760
Well, don't tell me that, Griffin,

787
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,440
because I need to sleep again or I'll die.

788
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
If you don't sleep, you will die.

789
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,480
Yeah, sure.

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm just saying that it would also make it hard to sleep

791
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,480
if, you know, glowing spiders everywhere would.

792
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,560
But they wouldn't be everywhere

793
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,800
because I would spend three days,

794
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,280
three sleepless days murdering them.

795
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,040
Yeah, all of them in the world

796
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,080
or just sort of in your house?

797
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
If that's what it took.

798
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,260
Okay.

799
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,920
Justin, you got any ideas?

800
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm not gonna sit here and play God.

801
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,560
Oh, okay.

802
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,840
You just think God got it in one.

803
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,480
Absolutely.

804
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
I mean, like, over time,

805
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
we've evolved a very fragile ecosystem.

806
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
I think man's done enough damage there

807
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,880
without me fucking making pandas green, you know?

808
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,800
Like, I think that it's just fine.

809
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,280
No, I think we can all agree.

810
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm with Justin to a certain extent.

811
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,080
I think God got it right for a lot of animals.

812
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,920
Pandas wouldn't change a thing actually there.

813
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,200
I think that that's optimal cuddliness.

814
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
A capybara, perfect.

815
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm super into, like, the flavor that they're bringing.

816
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
I'm just saying, like, let's have fun with it, Justin.

817
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
We're in the imagisphere now.

818
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,360
Okay, what about if you change the ball eagle?

819
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,440
Because it's already America's symbol.

820
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,160
Oh, I see.

821
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,880
It's a little boring.

822
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,200
What if you change it to, like, jet black

823
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
with, like, red neon eyes?

824
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,600
And maybe, like, some tracers, like, along the bottom.

825
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,240
Like, some neon tracers.

826
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
And a couple LEDs on its, like, around its...

827
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, what about on its under...

828
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,880
A few woofers and tweeters.

829
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,680
And on its belly, a bright yellow patch of feathers

830
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,640
that looks like a dick.

831
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,360
And when he flies over, it's like, ah, got you.

832
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
And everybody salutes that dick.

833
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,000
He saw it.

834
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,520
That's America's dick.

835
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
Man, Justin, I thought for sure

836
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,000
you were gonna say red, white, and blue.

837
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
Nah.

838
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
That's like America's, like, whole color scheme.

839
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,320
Yeah, that's like...

840
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,280
No, instead it sounds like you made it German colors.

841
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,720
Red, yellow, and black.

842
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
If it's red, white, and blue, you get it in front of a flag,

843
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,920
and it's like, where did it go?

844
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,240
Yeah.

845
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
Well, that's its natural camouflage.

846
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah.

847
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,360
Its camouflage is hiding in front of American flags.

848
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Yeah, and it eats NASCAR patrons.

849
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,600
It's a sacrifice we gotta make to freedom.

850
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,040
Listen, listen, Phil, I've told you once,

851
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,080
I told you a thousand times,

852
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm not doing any more NASCAR races in Florida.

853
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
Places infested by a camouflage...

854
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Super gators and dick eagles.

855
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,800
Super gators and dick eagles everywhere.

856
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,560
When was the last time you slept, Frank?

857
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,000
I can't, the spiders...

858
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,160
Yeah, there's glowing spiders everywhere.

859
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,160
Okay, well, you're gonna take a short sabbatical, Frank.

860
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,520
The super gators, the dick eagles, they're everywhere.

861
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,720
They would, of course, be natural enemies, right?

862
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Super gator versus dick eagle, this Friday on the Sci-Fi channel.

863
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,800
This is actually a funny coincidence,

864
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,720
Justin Travis and I all went to Huntington High School,

865
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,520
the mascot of which was the super gator.

866
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,120
And our rivals in Cabo Midland,

867
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,960
bunch of dick eagles over there is what they were.

868
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,120
Bunch of dick eagles, that mascot was, of course.

869
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,200
Not a lot of people liked going to those games.

870
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,480
I got a text this morning from my dear friend, Tommy Red.

871
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,040
We met the day before first grade started outside of his dad's house.

872
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,760
And I got a text from Tommy this morning.

873
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,400
My dear oldest friend in the world, Tommy Red.

874
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
Well, not my oldest, because he...

875
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,680
Anyway, I got a text from Tommy Red today that said,

876
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,680
got back from Texas today to find my me undies arrived.

877
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
These things are no joke.

878
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,000
They have lived up to the hype and make my junk look amazing.

879
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,200
And he's a big man.

880
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,800
He's a big man.

881
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,920
He's 12 and a half feet tall.

882
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
And girth wise, he's got a giant penis.

883
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,520
He's huge.

884
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,920
Tommy Red says that me undies are no joke.

885
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,920
And I'm here to tell you that they are super, super great.

886
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,880
The best underwear you will ever wear are me undies.

887
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
That's all they do.

888
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,360
That's what they're dedicated to.

889
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,200
They want comfortable underwear that fit great.

890
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,880
Don't ride up on you and literally pull moisture away from your skin.

891
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,320
So you're cool all day long.

892
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
This morning I woke up, all my me undies were dirty.

893
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,880
I put on some, let's just call them off brand underwear.

894
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,040
The first thing I did as soon as I hoisted the waistband up around my navel,

895
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,600
I vomited onto the ground because I hated the sensations.

896
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
It was so displeasurable to me.

897
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,760
Yeah, sure.

898
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,480
Miserable, miserable.

899
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
You know, I'm gonna say this.

900
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,000
I think they would make excellent Valentine's Day presents.

901
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,960
Oh, for sure.

902
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Oh my God, yeah.

903
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,720
Yeah, I guess it's tantamount to sort of like getting somebody lingerie

904
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,120
that you yourself is going to wear.

905
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,160
You get some me undies.

906
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,040
This is functional, practical lingerie, all day lingerie

907
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,240
for whatever genitals you're bringing to the table.

908
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,800
It's the lingerie that says, this is actually for you.

909
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,120
This isn't like for me to enjoy on you.

910
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,080
This is for you.

911
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,880
You're welcome.

912
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Well, it's for both of you because you're gonna look better.

913
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
This is for you and your genitals.

914
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
You're gonna feel better.

915
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
You're gonna smell better.

916
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,560
I don't wanna get blue, but there's an odor problem.

917
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,480
If you were to buy underwear of this quality,

918
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,560
normally they would cost you twice as much

919
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,840
as they cost you at me undies,

920
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
but they're not gonna do that.

921
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,080
They've got no middleman, so that's more savings for you.

922
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,680
But get this, they're gonna get even cheaper, okay?

923
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,400
Go to meundies.com slash my brother

924
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,280

926
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,080
So there.

927
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,520
I recently went through my underwear drawer

928
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,920
and there was a great reckoning, mostly socks related,

929
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
because my sock game, guys, not on point.

930
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,000
I had socks that I've had since college and they're not...

931
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,640
That's a true mark of maturity when you look at a grimy,

932
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,400
whole plagued sock and you think, I don't have to wear this.

933
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
These were socks in name only.

934
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,000
They were more like craft materials at this point.

935
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,560
And there was a reckoning, there was a purge.

936
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,160
And now I have freed up more space to fill with beautiful,

937
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,080
functional, practical, dare I say sexy, me undies.

938
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,880
Say it.

939
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,080
They're sexy, sexy.

940
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,760
Sexy.

941
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,360
20% off, go to meundies.com slash my brother.

942
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,920
Listen, folks, Valentine's Day is next week

943
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
and that means one thing.

944
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
Or if you're listening to this in March,

945
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
Valentine's Day was three weeks ago and you missed it.

946
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,080
Yeah, or if you're listening to this in 2028.

947
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,960
Valentine's Day was a fixed point in time.

948
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,600
Okay, at some point coming up soon now as you record this,

949
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,760
and that means one thing, it's time to bulk up the fiction

950
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
of your secret Canadian girlfriend or boyfriend.

951
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,440
Okay.

952
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,200
Pete, you've been telling them about this man or woman

953
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
for quite some time.

954
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
All your coworkers don't believe they exist.

955
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,480
Well, now's the time to really support it with some evidence.

956
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,840
Have you listened to Serial?

957
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,640
Mm-hmm.

958
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,600
That's what this is about, right?

959
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,760
So listen, how are you gonna do that?

960
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,880
Well, you're gonna get 100 blooms of love

961
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,520
with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

962
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
You can help bulk up the fiction of your secret Canadian

963
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,240
boyfriend or girlfriend.

964
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,360
Oh, Mike Swear exists.

965
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,240
Mike Myers got me those.

966
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,120
We're dating.

967
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,800
Mike Myers got me those, we're dating.

968
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
Oh, Mike, yeah.

969
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
These are from Colby Smulders.

970
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
Did you even see Love Guru?

971
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
Because that man in that movie got me these flowers.

972
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,240
Dude, do you even guru?

973
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,880
Dude, do you guru at all?

974
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
That movie was great.

975
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,400
You can add gourmet chocolates and a stuffed bear

976
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
for just $9.99.

977
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
Do you realize what a deal, I mean, in all seriousness,

978
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,360
that's a deal.

979
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,160
Listen, the flowers definitely, the stuffed bear, great.

980
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,280
When you get home to that cold, lonely apartment

981
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
and the fiction dissolves around you

982
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
like so much cotton candy.

983
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
A fiction that even you bought into is so convincing.

984
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,160
A fiction that you yourself bought into.

985
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,680
Yeah, Mike Myers would love me.

986
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
You're gonna need those chocolates.

987
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
You're gonna say $9.99 well spent.

988
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,440
And then you'll realize that Mike Myers

989
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
doesn't love you or anyone.

990
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,840
As you watch Shrek 3 and jerk off into a hat.

991
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,720
You're Mike Myers hat that folds up the brim

992
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,440
and it's like a fold up pop out of Wayne's world.

993
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
How's our advertisement?

994
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,200
These are some weird bullet points.

995
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,040
Finally, we're reading what's written here.

996
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,120
This is just like word for word.

997
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,840
Jerk, let me see, let me see.

998
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,080
Imaginary Canadian boyfriend, yeah, jerk off into a hat.

999
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,120
Yeah, guys, we're good.

1000
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Do you want me to read it?

1001
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
Guys, we're good, do you want to move on?

1002
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,320
Yeah, we're so good.

1003
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,520
Here's how you get it though.

1004
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,760
Listen, you're gonna go to proflowers.com

1005

There's a blue microphone when you go to proflowers.com.

1007
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
There's a blue microphone in the top right corner.

1008
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,400
You're gonna click on that and type in MYBROTHER.

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,600
We guarantee you're gonna feel like an all star

1010

as you look at these flowers and jerk off into your Shrek hat.

1011
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
They arrive fresh and they are guaranteed

1012
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
the last seven days or more and they do.

1013
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,680
They're amazing.

1014
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,240
They do.

1015
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,800
All joking aside, we actually have some in our house now

1016
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
from Pro Flowers and it's like, I don't know.

1017
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,920
It's the most beautiful flowers I've ever had

1018
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,360
in a home that I owned.

1019
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,560
I mean, even if you don't want to do it as a romantic gesture,

1020
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
they are just sort of nice to have around.

1021
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,240
I didn't think I was a plants guy,

1022
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,240
but I am genuinely enjoying this flora.

1023
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
Go to proflowers.com, click on the blue microphone

1024
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,840
and type in MYBROTHER.

1025
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,040
Have you guys heard about commingle.io?

1026
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,640
Let's assume that I have not and you tell me about it

1027
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,240
because that's what they paid for.

1028
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
Let me tell you about it, Travis.

1029
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,800
Holy shit.

1030
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,760
Wait, I want to tell you about their flagship product,

1031
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,720
the mod.

1032
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,040
Okay.

1033
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,800
The mod is...

1034
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,120
Is it like a video game?

1035
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,720
I feel so lucky.

1036
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,360
I feel like I need to refund these people's money

1037
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
and pay them more money.

1038
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
They have given us the gift of these wonderful words

1039
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,520
you're about to hear.

1040
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,480
I'm just going to read this for bucking vadum.

1041
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,280
Okay.

1042
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
Did you say ver-bucking babe?

1043
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,680
Ver-ver-ver-ver-ver.

1044
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,320
Yeah, we got it.

1045
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,760
Oh man.

1046
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,080
Okay.

1047
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,120
Ver-bate.

1048
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,680
Okay.

1049
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:27,920
Listen.

1050
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,200
Can someone reset Justin?

1051
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,840
The mod is a...

1052
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,040
Let me get both Sivas in here.

1053
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,600
He can handle this.

1054
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,240
No, no.

1055
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,640
I don't want to hear both Sivas.

1056
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,840
The mod is a multi vibrating open source dildo platform.

1057
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,440
It's powerful, pure body, safe silicone, gender neutral,

1058
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
and you can control it with any kind of sensor you want.

1059
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,360
For instance, squeezing, thrusting motions, music,

1060
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,960
cameras, paddles, Geiger counters, head massagers,

1061
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,640
breathing, and your pulse.

1062
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,800
I would suggest an EMF ghost detector.

1063
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,400
Right?

1064
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,360
A great idea.

1065
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm actually going to stick with the inputs.

1066
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm going to stick with the Geiger counter

1067
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,360
just because I just want to make sure everything's real safe up there.

1068
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,840
Can you set it like an alarm to wake you up in the morning?

1069
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,480
So that you can let your toy react to a sexy situation with you or your partner.

1070
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,640
What about that talk boy that you bought when Home Alone 2 came out

1071
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,240
and now it controls a dildo?

1072
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,200
Can you set it that like it reacts to everybody loves Raymond in some way?

1073
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,400
Yes.

1074
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,880
Bop it.

1075
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,160
Twist it.

1076
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,760
Ram jam it.

1077
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,120
Right up in it.

1078
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,480
Now twist it.

1079
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,880
Is the pizza here yet?

1080
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh, there's the doorbell.

1081
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,640
It's here.

1082
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,120
Whoa.

1083
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,440
Hold on.

1084
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,240
I got my dominoes.

1085
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,840
I didn't hear anything.

1086
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,520
No, it's probably here.

1087
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,120
Got my dominoes pizza tracker synced up with my dildo.

1088
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,960
Just waiting for it to go to quality check.

1089
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,480
Thank you, Derek.

1090
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,320
Thank you, Mike Myers.

1091
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,920
When that garage door opens, so do I.

1092
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,560
Yeah.

1093
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,360
Oh man.

1094
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,280
What a wonderful product, the mod.

1095
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,920
What a fucking the best product ever.

1096
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,840
At commingle.io.

1097
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,400
So go visit commingle.io

1098
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,640
and you can contribute to their Indiegogo campaign

1099
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,160
and purchase your own mod dildo while supplies last.

1100
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,520
Now it says mod dildo,

1101
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,480
but that's a multi-vibrating open source dildo dildo.

1102
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,800
And I don't think that's what the mod is the name of the dildo.

1103
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,280
The mod.

1104
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,440
Yeah.

1105
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,360
Whenever anybody says the word mod from now on,

1106
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,120
I'll just think it's a open source dildo platform.

1107
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,240
I got a message for Corey and it's from Andrew.

1108
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,000
Is it Corey or cause it's they phonetically spelled it Corey.

1109
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,500
Corey.

1110
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,780
Corey.

1111
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,100
Okay.

1112
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,220
I got a message for Corey from Andrew.

1113
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,500
There's an exclamation point at the end.

1114
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,020
Hi and hello.

1115
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,220
It's me, Andrew.

1116
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,460
It's been a delightful year getting to know you

1117
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,060
and young Cooper over whiskey, tea,

1118
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,620
sleepy music and cat puzzles.

1119
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,660
Here's to another like real humans smooches.

1120
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,340
I love you a whole bunch.

1121
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,220
Happy anniversary from this lightning horse

1122
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,860
and the three brothers to the sweetest cloud banger

1123
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,460
he could ask for pear syrup.

1124
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,260
Guys.

1125
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,980
Guys, stop with the coded messages.

1126
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,540
Just whatever happened to, to.

1127
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,420
Predictability.

1128
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,380
I know.

1129
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,620
The milk man, the paper boy.

1130
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:17,860
Yeah.

1131
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,820
Yeah.

1132
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,740
I loved step by step.

1133
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,540
Are cat puzzles when cats are wrapped around each other

1134
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,340
and you have to figure out a way to get them untangled.

1135
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,940
Yeah, I love doing those at Cracker Barrel

1136
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,380
when you're waiting for your table to open up.

1137
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,740
And if you're left with three cats,

1138
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,940
you're an egg new Ray moose.

1139
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,580
I think it's when a cat traps you.

1140
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,260
I think egg new Ray Meowth.

1141
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,380
I think it's when the cat traps you in a deadly game

1142
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,620
and you have to like prove how,

1143
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,020
how much you want to be alive by grievously injuring yourself.

1144
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,260
Yeah.

1145
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,860
Like Dr. Claw used to do to Inspector Gadget.

1146
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,460
It has a fucked up show.

1147
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,340
It was a fucked up show.

1148
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,620
He was a giant cat, right?

1149
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:55,860
Yeah.

1150
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,300
Happy anniversary.

1151
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,940
Yeah.

1152
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,380
Happy anniversary.

1153
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,500
I always thought that Dr. Claw was like just a bunch of cats

1154
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,580
in a person suit.

1155
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,860
Oh, we can talk about it off mic.

1156
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,980
Hey everybody.

1157
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,460

Join us every other Monday.

1180
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,280
Yay.

1181
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,740
My girlfriend's cat is getting old.

1182
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,860
That's really the next question.

1183
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,740
So here it is.

1184
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,100
My girlfriend's cat is getting old.

1185
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,500
And recently she's decided to make my girlfriend's bed

1186
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,300
her home.

1187
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,700
This has greatly impacted our lovemaking.

1188
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,500
Oh, great.

1189
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
The cat does not enjoy being moved from her bed,

1190
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,660
and she scratches at the door if we do.

1191
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,100
This is distracting during the act and damaging the door.

1192
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,660
Should we accept that we will have an audience going forward,

1193
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,860
or is there another solution?

1194
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,660
This is from Joey.

1195
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,940
Joey.

1196
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,660
Joey.

1197
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,160
Nice.

1198
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,820
Shut up, cat.

1199
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,900
Nice.

1200
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,860
Joey, you're doing great.

1201
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,220
Joey, I'm just sitting over here really appreciating

1202
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,860
what you're doing.

1203
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,980
Cat, please stop.

1204
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,140
Cat, would you please just be cool?

1205
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,860
Hey, socks.

1206
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,020
Would you mind keeping it down for like a minute?

1207
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,020
No, I'm just saying that you're doing great.

1208
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,980
You're doing great.

1209
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,260
I don't know how humans do it, but you seem to be crushing it.

1210
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,860
Good moves, Joey.

1211
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,980
She seems to be enjoying it as well.

1212
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,100
This is like an amazing rarity for our show.

1213
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,540
I actually have-

1214
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,820
Oh, I don't want to hear like your sex stories.

1215
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,020
No, no, not a sex thing.

1216
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,220
Another Justin sexcapade.

1217
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,380
I have so many to tell about, but this is not one of those.

1218
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,180
We had a problem where the cats would always want to get into our room while we're asleep,

1219
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,820
but I don't like them rolling around in there because I'm a very light sleeper.

1220
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,500
So here is the actual solution that we have been using for years,

1221
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,700
and it actually works like a charm.

1222
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,940
I bought a baby gate, and I lean it up against the door.

1223
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,500
When we go to sleep, I put the baby gate in front of the door in our bedroom,

1224
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,700
and they can't claw out the door.

1225
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,540
It's amazing, and it's a brilliant solution to your problem.

1226
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,140
Congratulations, it's been fixed.

1227
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,780
If, assuming your cat weighs 65 pounds and can't negotiate a baby gate.

1228
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,820
No, it doesn't work out.

1229
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,740
Amelia doesn't do it either.

1230
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,820
We're in the clear.

1231
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,660
You put the baby gate up, the cat's not going to scratch the door.

1232
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,380
You can sleep.

1233
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,340
Don't sleep.

1234
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,100
I mean, make love, and then when you get older, sleep no matter what you want to do in the bedroom.

1235
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,300
Oh my God, make love, make love, make love.

1236
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,980
You have to do it as much as you can right now, because pretty soon,

1237
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,820
pretty soon, yeah, Cecil won't do that.

1238
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,260
Cecil learned how to scream.

1239
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
Motherfucker don't meow anymore, he just yells.

1240
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,380
Hey, that's him outside the door.

1241
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey.

1242
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,620
I want to watch your lovemaking.

1243
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,900
Hey, wait, hey, hey.

1244
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,460
I hate, I hate, I love him, but boy howdy.

1245
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,060
But boo-boo nanny.

1246
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,580
He makes a boo-boo nanny like all the time scratching at the door,

1247
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,420
and I'm trying to make nanny boo-boo in the bedroom.

1248
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,460
Don't get those twisted.

1249
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,140
Oh my God, no.

1250
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,620
I mean, sometimes you can make a boo-boo nanny while you're making a nanny boo-boo.

1251
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,140
But do not make nanny boo-boo while you're making a boo-boo nanny.

1252
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,420
No, holy shit.

1253
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,780
How would you even do that?

1254
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,820
I don't even know.

1255
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,940
So are you slipping and falling and having an accident on the street?

1256
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,060
Whoa, we're sexing.

1257
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,940
Do you guys know Yahoo?

1258
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,380
Sure, yeah.

1259
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,940
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 5000 Yajushaman, Drew Davenport.

1260
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,420
Thank you, Drew.

1261
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:57,860
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Charissa Lozano, who asks,

1262
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,180
is it weird that I'm attracted to Transformers?

1263
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:03,380
Yes.

1264
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:10,900
Okay, I recently watched Transformers 4, and I started to notice that I find Prime,

1265
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,420
the enemy, I don't know what he's called, and especially Bumblebee attractive,

1266
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:23,060
even though they are like machines and not ever real, but I just find them sexy.

1267
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,780
I feel like it's weird, but I can't help it.

1268
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,140
Bumblebee is hot to me.

1269
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,820
Bumblebee is hot to me.

1270
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,140
Listen, I like to be cool with a lot of stuff.

1271
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,460
And this is no exception.

1272
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,100
Thank you, Travis.

1273
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,420
You're right.

1274
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,260
This is no exception, correct, Travis.

1275
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,340
You know, here's my question.

1276
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,140
It's not objective sexuality if they can move around and talk and shit.

1277
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,780
Is that what you're gonna ask?

1278
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,820
Okay, that's what, well, okay.

1279
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,220
It's not.

1280
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,980
Are you attracted to them when they're in car form?

1281
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Because that's object sexuality.

1282
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,100
If you're attracted to them in robot form, that's a whole other thing.

1283
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,140
I don't know that.

1284
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,660
I don't know that that's accurate, Justin, because-

1285
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,500
No, because they're sentient.

1286
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,020
Who is the car boy who, when he eats spicy food, he turns into a car?

1287
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,500
Hot Rod.

1288
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,620
Hot Rod.

1289
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,020
Hot Rod.

1290
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,060
If you fuck Hot Rod's Hot Rod while he's a hot rod,

1291
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,380
is that objective sexuality, or are you having sex with the-

1292
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,820
I think it's a man in the car.

1293
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,380
It was not Hot Rod, it was Turbo Teen, Travis.

1294
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,180
Turbo Teen, asshole.

1295
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,980
I don't know.

1296
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,340
You're the one who knows about the show.

1297
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,220
I just answered first.

1298
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,700
Then why did you answer wrongly for him?

1299
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,940
Because I like to buzz in, Griffin.

1300
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,220
I know you do.

1301
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,500
That's why you have negative 86,000 Jeopardy dollars.

1302
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,460
But I'll get that.

1303
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,980
I've been keeping a running total for as long as we've been doing the show.

1304
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,900
Turbo Teen, you fuck him in car form.

1305
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,260
I think you just had man sex.

1306
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,780
This whole question would be way less weird to me if, okay.

1307
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,660
Imagine we lived in a world in which there really were transformers

1308
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,340
and people were attracted to them,

1309
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,220
and they were like a real life thing that you could walk out on the street and see.

1310
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,580
Okay, but they're CGI in a movie.

1311
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,460
That's weird.

1312
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,500
That's weird to me.

1313
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,540
Bumblebee can't even-

1314
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,060
Bumblebee's the one that doesn't talk, right?

1315
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,380
Yeah, Bumblebee has a radio.

1316
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,220
Bumblebee just has a radio, right?

1317
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,940
He doesn't talk.

1318
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,300
So the one that you want to fuck the most is the one that is still a special magic robot

1319
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,860
that can transform into a big robot or into a car,

1320
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,300
but doesn't have the fucking personality of like a sentient thing.

1321
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,220
It's just, you're fucking Spotify at that point.

1322
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,820
You're fucking robo Spotify.

1323
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,300
Fellow MaxFun podcast, The Flop House, just did Transformers Age of Extinction,

1324
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,900
which is an excellent episode.

1325
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,180
And in it, they make an excellent point, which is that there are robots,

1326
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,860
there are transformers that like have weird chain beards and are like,

1327
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,300
and it's like, wait, hold on.

1328
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,540
You can choose whatever form you turn into.

1329
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,340
Like this is- I don't think that's a hundred percent true though.

1330
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,140
You don't think so?

1331
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,460
Like that they can't like,

1332
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,620
because they choose what vehicle they're going to turn into.

1333
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,420
Right.

1334
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,100
I don't know that they're,

1335
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,460
I think it's just whatever vehicle is closest when they reach earth

1336
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,140
and interact with the AllSpark, right?

1337
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,700
Oh God.

1338
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,420
Immediately after arriving in a new world, in its transition form,

1339
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:07,140
a transformer begins trans scanning to choose and generate a new exostructure slash disguise,

1340
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:12,020
appropriate to both its size slash body mass and its new locale.

1341
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,700
That's fucked up though.

1342
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,300
So a transition form of a transformer is really basically,

1343
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,620
it's almost like a comet.

1344
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:24,340
It's like a protoform stage transformer that is engineered for travel.

1345
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,500
So once it lands on earth,

1346
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,620
it finds a new exostructure slash disguise appropriate

1347
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,300
to both its size slash body mass and its new locale.

1348
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,940
I don't know why if you could choose to be,

1349
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:40,500
like when you land on earth, if you could choose to be like a Pontiac or maybe an Eagle.

1350
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,300
Or a fucking 1970 AMC Gremlin.

1351
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,620
Like fuck, now I'm a Gremlin?

1352
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,300
I'm a fucking Hugo?

1353
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:47,800
Awesome.

1354
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,420
I don't think you get hung up on like,

1355
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,620
I think you have bigger fish to fry than gender roles.

1356
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,220
Like I don't think you need to worry about it.

1357
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,940
I'm sorry, Justin.

1358
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,980
I hate to throw a wrench into the works, if you will,

1359
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,580
but Bumblebee does change his car shape in the first movie

1360
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,900
because he's an old beat up car and it's like, oh, there's a nicer car.

1361
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,420
These are not canonical though.

1362
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,020
There is a lot of evidence to suggest that they're quickly able to adopt new forms.

1363
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,140
So how permanent a trans scan's alternate form becomes,

1364
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,300
as well as how easily a transformer can scan and adopt a new one.

1365
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,460
Like why is Barry still a fucking debate?

1366
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,700
Why is Barry still a fucking dodge dart?

1367
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,020
Okay, now I do have to say if you want to get into the novels,

1368
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,860
like if you get a prequel novel like yesterday,

1369
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,900
Bumblebee transforms like really fast.

1370
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,380
But is anybody, is any human's fucking Bumblebee is the question.

1371
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,300
We have gotten so wildly spun out into this whole universe.

1372
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,780
On The Flop House, they also theorize, and I really enjoyed,

1373
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:48,100
that when a human is driving one of the cars, the transformers in car form,

1374
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,420
since they are self-propelled and do not need a person,

1375
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,980
that they're basically, the steering wheel is like, they're clitoris.

1376
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,580
And they get huge sexual pleasure out of it.

1377
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,660
You know what guys, just go listen to that one.

1378
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,620
It's way better than us.

1379
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,420
I think I would want to fuck Vibrato.

1380
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,500
Vibrato, the modular dildo bot.

1381
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:08,900
Uh-huh.

1382
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:09,860
Well, that's weird.

1383
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,740
He doesn't do a lot as far as like fighting evil, but.

1384
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,060
Yeah, the rest of us turn into cars, Vibrato,

1385
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,860
and you turn into a modular top of the line, fully modern, fully Wi-Fi dildo.

1386
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,740
Gender neutral.

1387
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,540
You turn into a gender neutral, body safe silicone Wi-Fi dildo.

1388
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,980
How did you, I didn't even know we could do that.

1389
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,060
Yeah, I just believed in myself, I guess.

1390
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,260
I came down and I landed next to a top of the line, modern space.

1391
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,660
I guess I just had faith in myself and I knew I could do it.

1392
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,380
I landed next to a modern space dildo while I was in my transition phase.

1393
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,700
I trans scanned it and said, that looks pretty tight.

1394
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,460
So yeah, now I turn into a dildo.

1395
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,220
But like, you're way bigger than the dildo.

1396
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,700
So like, when you transform, like a lot of your stuff shrinks down.

1397
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,820
I had to cut off my arms.

1398
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,460
I'm telling you, I don't understand the technology of it.

1399
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,860
I just sort of compact down and I become this new space age super dildo.

1400
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,260
And it's-

1401
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,020
Autobot, roll out.

1402
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,900
Wait, hold on.

1403
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,580
Has anyone seen Vibrato?

1404
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,540
He hasn't been around.

1405
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,180
Like, has he transformed back in a while?

1406
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,980
I love this modular dildo I just bought, but God damn,

1407
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,100
I wish I could turn into a two story tall robot while I have it

1408
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,660
plugged deep in my ass.

1409
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,180
Oh God, here it comes.

1410
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,380
I'm dead now, of course.

1411
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,580
And here I do too.

1412
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,140
I'm dead.

1413
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,100
I'm dead now, of course.

1414
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,860
But wow, that was the ultimate orgasm.

1415
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,780
My body was torn asunder, but as it rained down, it was orgasming.

1416
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,740
So listen, guys, I just want to make something real clear.

1417
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,900
I'm not going to get into the whole war with the Decepticons and the whatever.

1418
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,180
I'm not choosing Psy.

1419
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,460
Autobots, roll out.

1420
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,100
I can't really roll.

1421
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,340
I guess if you put me on like a steep enough hill

1422
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:43,300
and I'm in the proper modular phase, I will roll.

1423
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,780
Yo, just turning back into a robot Vibrato.

1424
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,140
I'm actually kind of cool as it is.

1425
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,820
I'm kind of getting like ram jammed on the reg.

1426
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,980
So like, I'm actually pretty cool with it.

1427
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,620
But thank you, good luck being a fire truck and stuff

1428
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,540
or whatever it is you guys do out there.

1429
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,700
And there is a scene in the first movie

1430
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,580
where Bumblebee pees onto John Turturro.

1431
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,820
So that would indicate that they do have some kind of genitalia set up.

1432
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,300
John Turturro robot water sports.

1433
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,380
That's the best Google search string I think I've ever conceived.

1434
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,660
That's somebody's fetish.

1435
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,020
You see that and it turns you on.

1436
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,740
You're like, oh no.

1437
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,540
I can only finish when a two story robot urinates on John Turturro

1438
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,620
and it's got to be different every time.

1439
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,540
There is not going to be.

1440
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,700
And then you get on the internet like, oh, thank goodness.

1441
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,820
There's literally infinite web pages devoted to exactly this.

1442
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,500
You go to his IRDB page.

1443
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,780
Does a robot piss on John Turturro in Barton Fink?

1444
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,420
No, God.

1445
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,660
You might like Barton Fink.

1446
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,300
You might like.

1447
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,940
And then it just lists the 10 other John Turturro movies

1448
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,180
in which he gets urinated by a two story robot.

1449
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,660
What, Fading Gigolo?

1450
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:49,780
Maybe.

1451
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,580
Mr. Deeds.

1452
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,420
He definitely urinated on Mr. Deeds,

1453
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,820
but it's more of like a metaphysical urination.

1454
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,780
I think in Adam Sandler's like movie making contract,

1455
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,060
it's a law that a robot has to pee on someone.

1456
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,300
And if a robot's going to pee on someone in your movie,

1457
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,580
you might as well get the best.

1458
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,100
Folks, this has been our podcast.

1459
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,300
We went an hour and I was like,

1460
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,300
we're not going to get a title for this episode.

1461
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,940
And then John Turturro Robot Watersports popped up

1462
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,740
and it was like, hey, everything's going to be all right.

1463
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm here.

1464
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,100
I'm here now.

1465
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,220
Thanks for listening to our show.

1466
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,180
So we still, in case you missed this news,

1467
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,300
we have expanded the venue for our upcoming live show

1468
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,380
in Chicago on April 5th, right?

1469
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,100
April 5th, yeah.

1470
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,420
On April 5th, we are in the Athenium Theater.

1471
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,700
There are some tickets still available for that.

1472
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,900
We sold a ton.

1473
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,700
Thank you, Chicago.

1474
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,340
It's already going to be our biggest show ever.

1475
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,780
So thank you so much.

1476
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,540
I'm thinking about now and I'm going to barf.

1477
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:53,780
Yeah.

1478
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,140
So thank you.

1479
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,500
If you want to get tickets to that,

1480
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,300
it's bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m Chicago.

1481
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,620
And we have tickets to our Milwaukee show too.

1482
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,420
That's selling out fast.

1483
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,620
I think it's about 80% gone.

1484
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,140
So if you've been waiting to get tickets,

1485
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,340
make sure you get them real quick.

1486
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,020
That's what is that, Trav?

1487
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,500
What's the address?

1488
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,380
I want to say that that's bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m-m-i-l.

1489
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,420
That's right.

1490
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,700
Okay, cool.

1491
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,100
We have live shows coming up.

1492
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,940
We have two live shows this weekend.

1493
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,380
One in L.A., one in San Francisco.

1494
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,940
We're very, very excited to see all of our California buddies again.

1495
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,340
Send in your questions, please, and send in your yahoos.

1496
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,100
We're getting a lot because we're doing two shows back to back.

1497
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,580
If I could take, can I take a minute, you guys?

1498
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,080
Sure.

1499
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,900
Do you mind if I have a minute here?

1500
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,820
Because it's time for the the annual my bim bam.

1501
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,180
Maybe, maybe check those yahoos before you send them in announcement.

1502
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:55,540
The courtesy announcement in which I annually just ask people to keep those yahoos

1503
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,340
civil a little bit.

1504
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,660
That maybe if you have like a really great one about like incest,

1505
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,060
maybe you go ahead and keep that one.

1506
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,060
Go ahead and keep that one in the garbage where it belongs.

1507
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:13,780
Maybe if you have one about like tricking somebody into eating period blood,

1508
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,820
maybe you just put that one right back in the garbage

1509
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,740
and then you burn that garbage forever.

1510
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,740
It was a pretty, it was a pretty rowdy week in the inbox.

1511
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:29,620
A lot of really upsetting stuff that I was exposed to and am now a different

1512
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,820
and one would say worse person just sort of across the board.

1513
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,420
Thank you all for sending in those yahoos.

1514
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,780
I know it takes time to dig for them, but just like if while you're digging,

1515
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,740
you hit an incest turd, don't touch it.

1516
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:45,860
Leave it there or tell like a waste management professional about it.

1517
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,260
I also want you to know I'm just gonna real quick.

1518
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:54,340
I'm putting a moratorium for the time being on how do I deal with terrible co-worker questions

1519
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,900
because we have done a ton of those and we get a ton of them a lot.

1520
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,980
I understand that co-workers are terrible, but just know that if you submit those questions,

1521
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,140
it's probably gonna be a while before one of them makes it on the show.

1522
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,660
If you've listened to the show in like previous episodes

1523
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,700
and you hear a question similar to the question you wanna ask

1524
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,340
within like the last 40 episodes,

1525
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,300
chances are it'll probably not make it on the show.

1526
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,100
We love really unique and like specific questions to your situation.

1527
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,500
So those kinds of things usually have a better shot.

1528
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,740
We've been in this fucking game for like 12 years now.

1529
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,620
So there's not a lot of ground we haven't uncovered.

1530
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,860
And that's not us chastising, by the way.

1531
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,540
I mean, it's no skin off our nose.

1532
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:39,140
We just wanna get as many people to get questions on the show as humanly possible.

1533
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,780
I wanna thank MeUndies for supporting our podcast.

1534
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,220
Go to meundies.com slash my brother

1535
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,780

1536
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,460
And right now you get free shipping.

1537
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,500
So that's a deal.

1538
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,740
Oh, and one more thing about sending questions.

1539
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:55,380
It's probably none of you, but sending questions to mbnbam at gmail.com

1540
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,700
is like the worst way to get a hold of Jesse Thorn.

1541
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,060
We get a lot of questions that are like,

1542
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,660
hey, Jesse, we don't like, he doesn't check those.

1543
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,620
He doesn't work for us.

1544
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,900
And you should also send those to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

1545
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,220
What's maximumfun.org, you ask?

1546
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,820
Well, that's a podcast family with a lot of great shows.

1547
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,260
We talked about the Flophouse this week.

1548
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,820
We've got our D&D family fantasy adventure epic with our dad,

1549
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,940
The Adventure Zone medical history podcast called Sawbones

1550
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,940
that I do with my wife, Sydney, who's a physician.

1551
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,860
And then Travis does a show called Bunker Buddies with his buddy Andy,

1552
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,300
and they talk about disaster scenarios and how you can survive them.

1553
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,860
There's a lot of non-macro related programming there too,

1554
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,060
like Jordan, Jesse, Go and Bullseye,

1555
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,140
a great pop culture show you should be listening to.

1556
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,220
John Hodgman with our friend-

1557
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,540
John Hodgman.

1558
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:47,940
John Hodgman.

1559
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,460
It's kind of like right there.

1560
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,180
And a lot of people wonder how do you get to the maximum,

1561
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,100
how do you get to maximumfun.org?

1562
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,380
Well, you just go to booboo nanny.com.

1563
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,180
Did you fucking-

1564
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:58,660
And that's gonna lead you to-

1565
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,300
You are going-

1566
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,420
You have a child that you have to support financially.

1567
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:05,220
You have to stop spending all your goddamn money on

1568
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,140
Jokey Joke web domains that redirect to maximum to Mabim Bam,

1569
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,980
but don't stop doing it because I love it.

1570
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,740
And it's my favorite thing about you.

1571
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,540
Just, okay.

1572
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,860
I just want to make sure that you do in fact love it.

1573
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,340
You can also access that through fartpatrol.com

1574
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,940
or mysmoothface.com.

1575
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,460
Oh my God, you did booboo nanny.

1576
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,740
Wait, I want to go.

1577
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,540
Can I tell you something though?

1578
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,860
Is it b-o-o-b-o-o-nanny.com?

1579
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,740
And by registering booboo nanny, Justin, can I say something?

1580
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,140
What?

1581
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,340
That was not a booboo nanny.

1582
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,460
Yeah, thanks.

1583
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,500
That was a sound decision.

1584
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,420
Once that phrase has fully seeded this earth,

1585
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,660
I can't wait to hear like how it is translated into different languages.

1586
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,820
That's going to be very exciting for me as its progenitor.

1587
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,940
I think that that web domain is just going to sort of skyrocket.

1588
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,180

just a little bit more attention from people who only listen to the top 10.

You know who you are.

You could throw in Flophouse for entertainment.

Movies and films.

1613
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:12,660
The really important one is that you vote for us.

1614
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,060
That's like the super important thing.

1615

But please go do that.

01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,060
You're a taxpayer, right?

Well, then you've got it coming.
