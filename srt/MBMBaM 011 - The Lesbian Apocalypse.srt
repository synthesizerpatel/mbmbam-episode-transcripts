impresario Justin McElroy

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm the other guy Travis McElroy

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm the Queen Latifah of podcasting Griffin McElroy. Don't you claim that like you can just

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,680
Hog that for yourself. I'm gonna take it. You guys can you guys can be your your own soul mistresses, but I call Erica Badiou

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,440
That's a good one. All right, Justin. What do you think in Macy Gray? I try to say goodbye, but we just started the show

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,160
So here's our first question that comes to us from Austin via gmail

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
He says hey guys

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,480
Do girls find it attractive if you listen to certain types of music or maybe a certain artist if so

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,200
Which ones do you think they like? Thanks for your time. Ah

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Wow, what a bummer way to start off

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
The shit out of me dude

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,080
it's sad that that you have to ask this question because

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,640
It's doubly sad that the answer is of course. Yeah, of course there are I I think

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,160
It all depends on the type of girl. You're trying to woo

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
if she's a more

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,800
Let's say common type you'll want to listen to the mainstream artists of the day

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,560
You're you're Justin Bieber's you're you're nickel backs

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,200
If if she's a little like she if she if she's in the smart dudes gotta go jazz

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,640
If you have a working knowledge of jazz

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Then then you're gonna be able to bring in those those smart girls

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,880
She's a little more tender go with like some

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,640
Damien rice something like that is very good. You guys have any suggestions zydeco zydeco

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,620
Beat no one can resist nothing but zydeco zydeco

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,720
Watch out for being too eager to say oh, yeah

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,080
I'd love them too because now you have to go to their concerts and they're awful like Nickelback if you're like, yeah, baby

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,600
I love Nickelback too

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,920
Man, now you're locked into that and then halfway through the concert should be like, I'm sorry

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,280
I have to tell you I know you love them, but these guys are terrible and you like I think they're terrible

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Let's leave

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Let's go have premarital sex

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,200
You won't have that problem though if you're at a zydeco concert

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,400
yep, just turn on the the soundtrack to divine secrets of the Aya sisterhood and

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
And that

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Heavily zydeco inspired. It's heavily zydeco inspired. Yeah, it's it's heavy on zydeco

45
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Guess we answer the question. I don't know

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Yeah, it depends on what the it

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,040
It always is about what the the person likes try to strike a balance between what they like and what you think they would like

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
I

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,720
Here's a suggestion

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Girls like guys with self-respect

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,080
Yeah confident guys don't like what you like dude and they'll respect that be able to look at yourself with a mirror Austin

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm currently seeing a girl

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
You should talk to her. So listen our podcast. I mean you're seeing a girl

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,200
Relationship-wise who used to date a good friend of mine. I really like this girl. She's funny and beautiful and

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,480
Now not only does my friend not liking me. He wants to fight me

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,100
I know I could take him if it came down to it. What do I do? Okay, Morgan

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
This fight is over

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
Johnny it's over

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,560
He lost you don't need to fight him. He lost in the sense that you're now dating his girlfriend

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
But he could still win

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,040
In a physical match. That's what I'm saying. I I think the real question here is what kind of time frame

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,920
We're looking at when you say he used to date her like he used to date her yesterday

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Yeah, but no, I think the real question is how bigger is pythons if we're talking like a 20-inch Python what caliber gun he's got

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,740
Yeah, I what I'm saying is you this is a lose-lose situation for you. I mean

66
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,420
No, no lose-lose. It's a lose

67
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,960
It's a it's a lose-win that you don't have to enter into because if you lose this if you lose this fight

68
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,340
Then this dude gets to look beef in front of his ex-lady and maybe you'll lose her to him. It's very primal

69
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,140
It's oh, it's a biological nose. He knows he could take him if it came down to it

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,940
Oh

71
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,980
That's mind

72
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:36,180
Does he know in that way that guys like myself have never been it who've never been in a real fight think that?

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,940
Should they be in a real fight? They could probably beat anybody. I could take Jason Statham

74
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,700
so find your strength and then challenge him to that like perhaps a a

75
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,780
downhill ski race on the most dangerous mountain a

76
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
game of Battleship

77
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,000
Perhaps act like you pity him all the time. That is the only way to win just by God

78
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,580
That's very sad. Like I know you want to fight me but like I know you miss her

79
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,180
I'd miss her too if I lost her. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I like that a lot. It's tear him down inside out

80
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,140
That's a you're not gonna fight him make it seem like cuz it's too beneath you. Yeah, it's like oh, that's really fake

81
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,820
That was advocate though. You're cold playing your bro

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,420
That's your bro. And and you are kind of giving him the business

83
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,420
But all of these questions that are like a friend of mine and I did this to them or a friend of mine and they did

84
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,580
This to me. These people aren't friends. Yeah

85
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
You I feel like there's another

86
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,540
Advice podcast out there. That's like bizarro

87
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,840
My bim bam where the actual the people who are being transgressed upon

88
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Go like my friends dating my friend now, and I'm sad all the time

89
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,980
It's not for winners who listen to this show yeah losers

90
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,740
Um Griffin, you want to give us a question? Yeah, sure. How about one from Yahoo?

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,660
Okay

92
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,980
This person's name is kind of offensive. So I'm not going to read it

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,020
Open question help wife dresses me in child's clothes. Oh

94
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,340
Man help wife dresses me in child's clothes. I have all the mr. Men t-shirts

95
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,260
I could own I look like a small child in a big body. I want a Motorhead t-shirt

96
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,260
How to point out the subtle difference without seeming ungrateful?

97
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,860
That is how adults dress

98
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,220
All I can think is he must look like right after Tom Hanks

99
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,020
Changes into the adult in big and like it's like whoa

100
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,900
Like all of a sudden you went from being six to ballooning up to being like 35 like an adult in a Motorhead t-shirt

101
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,940
Forget about suits and ties and button-ups

102
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:06,620
There it's just when you grow up you wear more adult t-shirts like Motorhead like Motorhead or other adult themes

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,460
Journey, I don't know about all this guys. I don't know

104
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,900
maybe he maybe he lacks maybe he's like

105
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,500
Maybe he's like John McCain. He can't dress himself because of his arms that he got broke

106
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,700
You're thinking about don't

107
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,860
Know McCain had it too. He had those arms that he couldn't you know

108
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,760
That's on the Republicans do to you before they let you run for president. Yes, they hobble your shoulder

109
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,660
Give you a kid mannequin arms. Hey, she changed your mind. We just hobbled you for life

110
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
It's gonna play really well

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,060
with our base

112
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:50,020
Our base loves hobbled men. I just give this good guy in my brother my brother me advice and making fun of veterans a

113
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Good show this is

114
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,060
Tristan's our boy. Yeah, he's not a vet though yet. He's still up in it. He's a vet

115
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,180
He's an amateur. I think I don't think I don't think you're a vet until you get back and he ain't back

116
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
He's still up there crushing Osama's guts

117
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:13,660
I did you guys hear about the dude that like rolled up to Afghanistan with a sword and a pistol

118
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,740
He's like I'm here to decapitate Osama bin Laden

119
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,000
My first thought was yeah, Tristan. Yeah

120
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
What

121
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
My problem was they detained the guy

122
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,380
He's the guy I want over there yeah, we want people like that over there I went over there with a

123
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,060
boom box and some unlaced chucks and said I'm here to de-rap-i-tape

124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,540
I saw him bin Laden give him my funkiest beats

125
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:54,140
No guys, nothing doing. Formspring someone on Formspring asked I'm on the job hunt in this tough economy and

126
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,180
Any advice on acquiring a job would be much appreciated as well as any advice for any job interviews. Ooh

127
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,180
Ooh, man

128
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,540
Travis you've had about nine jobs in the past year. Why don't you yes, I have

129
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,940
Well, the thing about applying for jobs in a tough economy is the difference between looking for a job and looking for a career

130
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,980
Because you can get a job at like McDonald's or Walmart

131
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,220
But that's not what most people are looking for

132
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,380
So if you're getting to a point where you're really strapped for cash, you got to lower them standards

133
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah

134
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:35,580
But just apply everywhere like you never know you have options. You never know who's gonna be hiring. Yeah

135
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,220
Job interviews goes just never break eye contact

136
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Sweat as much as possible

137
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,780
As soon as you break eye contact you've lost it. You done fucked up. Don't forget to use your your connections, right if you got

138
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
friends family whoever who are

139
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,400
Business owners or no business owners ask if they're looking for anybody

140
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,520
Thank you. Um, and you can always just sex your way to the top sex your way to the top

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,680
I know we got this podcast hard and fast rule in job interviews

142
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,400
And it is number one rule as someone who has interviewed a bunch and interviewed people when you go into the job

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Find out what the employees of that company are expected to wear every day then dress one step better than that

144
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Mm-hmm

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Never show up to an interview in jeans and a t-shirt never jeans never jeans never jeans are going to your boy for a retail

146
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,000
Location where they wear like khakis and a polo wear khakis and a dress shirt

147
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Something like that so that you look like you actually care about getting the job

148
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,080
I know it seems like a good idea to walk in stab somebody and say well, I guess you got an opening

149
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,400
But um, it's it's not it's not a good idea it's a bad a patently bad idea

150
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,840
That's not the kind of person they want on the team. If nothing else watch

151
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,960
The Michael J. Fox movie. Oh, I fucked it up. What is it? The one way he does Oh back to the future

152
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
That's it. Good gag

153
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
the one about business

154
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
gag

155
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,480
Great great great anecdote associated question

156
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Anecdote associated question

157
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,020
The Dan Shires asks on Twitter. Hey guys, how much is too much when bending the truth on a job application?

158
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,900
Do you get caught bro? You will get hot

159
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
No, I said till you get caught

160
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,920
They know you will you will get caught inevitably. It depends on the job, right? Like McDonald's at Burger King. Don't talk

161
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
They're not gonna like call and be like, is this guy good? Is he down?

162
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,080
The best is the truth. That's a special skills. I

163
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Yeah

164
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,800
You know

165
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,920
What truth like do you want to pretend like you had a job that you didn't?

166
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,560
I mean if you have a friend who will lie and say that that they're their manager of a closed business like

167
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah, I mean you can get away at that. That's not tough

168
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,080
but I don't know that you want to get into a job where

169
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,540
They think you have some frame of reference that you don't have

170
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:18,400
Here's my advice come up with a bullshit term for the job that you did like first shift supervisor or something

171
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
But really you were just there by yourself

172
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,600
Because nobody checks that nobody calls and says was he the first shift supervisor

173
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,520
Just make up a job title for a job. You actually did but make it sound way more impressive

174
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,480
I say always list that you can juggle at TCBY whenever I put that on our resume

175
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,960
I always say that I was the chief yogurt tester when really it just meant that I sat around and ate a

176
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,920
Bunch of free yogurt, you know, they're close now, right TCBY. Good job. Oh, that's a shame. Good job

177
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:56,160
I didn't have a lot of it. How's that free yogurt now you cocksucker. It's not my body anymore

178
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,440
I had that job a long time ago. You made me sick. Is it okay to drink alone? Yep. Ask one angry Zeus

179
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
What is okay, I mean

180
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
It's probably it's not okay to get drunk alone. I

181
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,120
Don't think not on a regular basis. No, not on any basis

182
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,600
But I think it's okay to my friend Dwight says it's not drinking alone if you're talking on the internet. I

183
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,520
Think I think it's worse to say I want to drink I need to go get some people so I feel okay drinking

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,600
I think that's more of a statement than just drinking by yourself. Why don't I I mean

185
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,240
If you're drinking excess to get drunk by yourself, that's not good

186
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,920
if you're like want to unwind with a beverage your grown-ass man do it I

187
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Call bevon sometimes sometimes and I there's nothing wrong with it because I enjoy a cold bev at the end of a long hot day

188
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
long hot day of what

189
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,920
Work, I'm working working. We do the same thing, right? That's what I make sure. Mm-hmm

190
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
But Griffin does it in a sauna

191
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,360
So I do it in a sauna and I do squats between every post and you don't bev at all all work

192
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,040
I know I'd stay dry dry as a popcorn

193
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,520
Dry as a what dry as a popcorn fart

194
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,040
Are you getting that going or is that yeah, I'm trying to get it spinning

195
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,960
We'll see this is really the first

196
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,560
It's the first outing the first time I've really really brought that really limited usage

197
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,780
No, no, no, it's it's there are a lot of occasions where it's appropriate. I am so

198
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,800
Just now on this podcast Yahoo Answers

199
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:53,640
Yahoo Answers user a 23 asks is it possible that a human turns into a monster like in the Resident Evil movie in a

200
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
future

201
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:03,120
There is a future in which that is possible his explanation. Okay, the big monster in the Resident Evil movie resulted from a genetic

202
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,480
Experiment in a human being well, I mean that's just science. Yeah

203
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,640
people are doing genetic experiments every day and one of these days they're gonna try and cure Alzheimer's and then

204
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,600
Giant monsters gonna come out or a gentle monster or a giant intelligent shark

205
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,120
What are there any answers to that and is there any people trying to get down on helping him out?

206
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Let's see what people said

207
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,560
It is possible, but not likely at all. What the fuck is possible. It's possible

208
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,740
What do you mean? It's possible that it might turn that a human might turn into a monster because the genetic experiments

209
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,560
Yes, some of our ancestors apparently such as the

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:53,240
Meganthropus a type of homo erectus fossils sound like some scary individuals so we could devolve into

211
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Giant horrifying cavemen basically

212
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,560
But those guys seem hilarious and all they do is you know

213
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Shill car insurance not bowl. I make unfunny sitcoms

214
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,840
Really a movie apparently a hit movie fucking kidding me soon to be hit. Are you fucking joking with me?

215
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,460
Yeah, I'm gonna see that caveman film. I'll go see that

216
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
whatever

217
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,400
Sounds good. I'm in my early 20s and currently single my problem is that when I see an attractive girl

218
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I cannot tell how old she is

219
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
Once I even started talking to girl right she was still in high school or oh

220
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Which caused me to walk away immediately

221
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,040
Allegedly okay good. I'd like to like

222
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,480
out out how old never mind I

223
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,600
Just I actually just want to get my driver's license you said you're in high school get out

224
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,720
I really don't want to be labeled to some kind of pervert

225
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,900
If you guys have an easier way to tell the approximate age of a girl without simply walking out to her like a creeper

226
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,600
And just flat-out asking it would be much appreciated

227
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,320
Have you considered have you considered cutting her in half and counting her rings

228
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,000
Or is that all you can consider you sicko

229
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,800
Listen some people are just some people are age-blind and I I understand that it's not a problem that I have

230
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm like a carny with my ability to guess people's age like to the month

231
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
um

232
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,320
But yeah, I don't know what to tell you DJ because you really can't just walk up there and be like hey

233
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
This this is your age. What is your age? Let me know cuz I'm let I win

234
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
I may try and start something

235
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,640
DJ I have and gas station approach where unless they look 35 assume. They're underage I

236
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,040
Have a question if I can call you Deej um

237
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
um

238
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,680
What is your life

239
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,960
Stra- I assume your worry is that you don't want to have sex with an underage girl cool

240
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,920
What is going on with your life strategy that you think there's a fairly good chance

241
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,120
You could end up boning down on a girl before you figure out what her like life

242
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,620
Situation is like before you figure out how old she is and stuff like what kind of chicken and egg situation

243
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,720
Do you have where that's your that's your approach also? Where are you meeting these women I?

244
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,080
Have no idea how old you are hey Justin Bieber concert

245
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Hey, yeah, maybe don't maybe don't try and pick up chicks in the Dave and Buster's arcade room man

246
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,480
I love chicken nugget day. Do you guys love chicken nugget day?

247
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,360
You finish that school rule. What are you doing after this?

248
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,080
This is such a good place to come eat. I eat here like five times a week. It seems like what about you guys?

249
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,920
I want to get out of here. I've got cigarettes

250
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,400
This isn't a public playground. This is it. This is oh, this is actually attached to your school

251
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,160
So I should I shouldn't be here is what you guys like Boone's farm

252
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,900
I'll get you some Boone's farm. Hey if that older lady gets tired of pushing you on the swing. I'm happy to

253
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,000
On there you should look about the same age is that I'm sorry. This is a this is a mental problem

254
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,280
I have yeah, I know it's a mental problem. You're a pedophile DJ

255
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,560
But no wait. No DJ is a loyal my bim-bam listener. We can't be too hard on him because

256
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,480
Girls are getting older younger. You know I mean ma'am blue members what he is

257
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Now get me J. I'm not talking about young boys though. No young girls. He just wants to get down with young girls

258
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,920
So he's not what their manager is

259
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:49,480
That's the best way to figure out if a girl is in high school versus college ask her what her major is

260
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,280
Yeah, she will say I am in high school. She'd be like a recess

261
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I know I'm not I think I think DJ you would be helped enormously if you had a good if you had a pre-planned

262
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Exit line for if the girl told you that she went to high school like if you knew what you were gonna

263
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,920
Do because I think that's your worry that it'll be awkward and and you just say so do you go to school?

264
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,800
And if she says I'm in high school you say like have you considered accepting Jesus Christ as your personal?

265
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,640
And then she'll say like what and you're like out. I was gonna say claim to be an undercover cop

266
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,200
Do you know where I can score some ecstasy?

267
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Can you talk into my lapel

268
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:39,440
What's the best way to tackle writer's block aspects pixelated pixel rave it's pixel rated pixel rated

269
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,740
You

270
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Can't actually tackle writer's block

271
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:51,040
That's that's the truth. You just get up absent. No no no no no you just have to give up on it for a little bit

272
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,120
And then come back later when you're not as blocked, and I've never had it when I have writer's block. I just write some shit

273
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,640
Sure, I just write shit that I've seen other people write before

274
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
writers walk for three years yeah

275
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,600
I think seriously though. I think 99% of the time if you have writer's block

276
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,400
You're actually just burned out because you've been doing what what you've been writing too much

277
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,880
That's a good. Yeah, that's true

278
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,320
You got to get up and and you know go do some other things and it may feel like a waste of time

279
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,440
But I work will improve

280
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,520
I believe that a lot of what we think of is traditionally think was creativity is really just

281
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,080
The the input that you take it in being sort of repurposed in your head and sort of sorting it out

282
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
so take in some like

283
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Stimulating stuff like go see a

284
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,820
movie that's a little more challenging than something you normally watch or listen to some music that

285
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,120
You wouldn't normally listen to something kind of break your your rut and get that creative part of your brain flowing

286
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,560
I don't even think you can I don't think you can lose creativity as much as you can lose motivation

287
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,120
I think that's right. That's a lot of inspiration

288
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,160
You just gotta you know get away for a little bit. Just go away take a break do something else

289
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,740
I don't know if I'm a blank screen. I think I take a half hour break in the middle of the podcast

290
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
To get my juices flowing. Thank you

291
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Yeah, here here rough edit in the middle. Let's sort of his left just like this

292
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,420
Yeah, he usually says peace. I usually say peace. Sometimes that makes it into the final cut. Hey him a bim-bam

293
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm sorry. Good for you gonna read this question. Well, I was gonna read a yahoo answers question, but save it

294
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm saving it up save it. Hey move in BAM. So I am a nice girl and I'm having trouble meeting a nice guy

295
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I meet a lot of people but it seems for every one nice guy meet there are ten creepers hitting on me

296
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What is this thing with creepers?

297
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,680
How do I find more quality men without having to deal with so many creepers?

298
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
With so many DJs

299
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,620
Creeping around asking where I go to school and if I want to accept Jesus

300
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,120
I like she says this I picture like a

301
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,520
Like a house of mirrors kind of situation where she's surrounded by eleven guys and she has to pick out the one nice guy from

302
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,560
The ten creepers. Hey, I are eleven guys hitting on you at the same time. I have a question form spring

303
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
How many nice guys do you need to meet?

304
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,960
One nice guy for every ten guys on average meeting eleven people you like one of them. How many do you want?

305
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Burning through the nice guys. You're a man eater

306
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
You only need the one, you know

307
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:33,280
Nice guy. You only need the one unless you're getting into some big love shenanigans. Yeah that and then by all means

308
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,160
Just say just you know, ask them if they're a creeper if they laugh it off

309
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,280
Then they're probably nice guy if they're like, how old are you then they're a DJ

310
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,240
I'm just kidding or they are actually like a DJ. They are a DJ. They're a creepy DJ a creepy wedding DJ

311
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,760
Like that guy who slapped that that poor lady's bosoms

312
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,760
That's not gonna make any sense everybody has seen that fucking video

313
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
It's the most magical video. Um

314
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
but

315
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,820
We get this question a lot and it's so alien to me because I'm so used to it the other way

316
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,080
Yeah, right ten ladies

317
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,380
Everyone nicely. Hey, you know great place to meet people to meet to reconnect to connect for the first time to re reconnect after

318
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
You've disconnected. It's the

319
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,600
bim-bam

320
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,400

So go to our webpage and bmb am calm and click on our Facebook group and there's there's a lot of nice

322
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
attractive people there

323
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,760
To meet there was a there's a pretty big thread on there the love and friendship connection thread

324
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,840
Which I had I adore and it's full. There's a lot of magic happening there

325
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,600
But I recently noticed that somebody started his own thread that says I need a girlfriend

326
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,480
He's taking a very a more direct approach to it and I wish him the best of luck. I like it. I

327
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,280
Honestly, I think it's great. You know, we call that go get him go attitude. Yeah attitude

328
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,320
Yahoo answers user. Oh, it's just an exclamation point. I'm gonna pronounce that

329
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,660
Hmm open question ladies if you found out that Prince William quote

330
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,440
Fancy to you and was interested in marriage. What would you say? And

331
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,700
Why lol, how serious would you take him and would you accept please explain?

332
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,880
I

333
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,400
Think I would just are you asking me? I mean, I that's that's usually what we do in these. I think

334
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,200
That it would it would be weird

335
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I would hope you'd be tender

336
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,760
Let's quick pull do do any of us actually know who Prince William is and what he looks like

337
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,000
He's that cute one, right? He's the one but he dressed up like a Nazi one time right in a Halloween party. I

338
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,360
Remember seeing he's got a great sense of humor on the Sun

339
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,400
He'd be like he'd be like cool. Blimey, Justin. I'm totally into you

340
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:36,880
I think you just need to look at him and say that's not my bag, baby

341
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,720
Yeah, all right, can we just get two more minutes of straight awesome

342
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,880
Problem

343
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,520
That junk on blu-ray. I gotta get that it is

344
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I trapped you

345
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,720
$90,000

346
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Have you noticed the trend where women always end up with men?

347
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,640
Excluding McElroy's that are less attractive than them am I just doomed to spend money on makeup and a gym membership while my significant other

348
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,800
Has a receding hairline and computer pudge

349
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,320
Forms yes, I can see at first. I thought this question was from a man

350
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,920
Then it I realized it was from a woman and I took a significant turn hard. I don't know. I okay form spring. What's

351
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,800
Forget Travis and Griffin for a second. Just you and me talking. I

352
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,560
Think there's a good chance you're a lesbian now hear me out I

353
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:37,000
Think that what I was thinking in my head is I was reading this is it was from a guy

354
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,600
What I was gonna say is well, that's natural because you're gonna find guys more attractive

355
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,240
Guys less attractive because you're a dude and you're into ladies

356
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,480
But you're a lady who says that I mean if you accept the idea that most people are gonna pair off

357
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,200
What you're saying is that most women are more attractive?

358
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,640
than most men

359
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,840
But that's true, yes, I'm not even saying that from from

360
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,000
Right, but of sexual orientation. I'm saying

361
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,840
Dudes don't give as much of a shit as ladies give about their personal appearance

362
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,080
Leading to they're being far far more attractive women than there are men

363
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,200
What I'm saying is that the planet is being choked by overpopulation and it is biologically

364
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,400
Increasing the number of gay people to try to limit the population. It makes perfect biological sense

365
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,960
We have more think that this like from an evolutionary standpoint. Didn't that make perfect sense? What a beautiful

366
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,720
wonderful way of of of evening out the population of

367
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Of the earth. It's an increasing adoptions. Yes. Yeah, and that's nice too. Lots of babies with good homes

368
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,480
I think it's wonderful, but you have to accept that's happening at an alarming rate. If this is this is

369
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Yucky, right?

370
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,000
Sexy sexy right that this is happening and I think it's beautiful. I think it's I think it's wonderful

371
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,920
I just think that you are into girls and that's good. That's fine

372
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,160
That's fine. I think girls than do women are way more attractive than guys

373
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Actually, this is a stone fact

374
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,080
Women are soft and nice and they smell good. Stop it. You're fucking grossing me

375
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,400
Gross gross what gross they taste sweet

376
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,320
I'm saying is that earth is making people gay

377
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:49,920
Eventually women are gonna get sick of how every man on earth is just a hideous ago beasts like

378
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:56,560
Who just fucking that does just sit on his his computer and and pick at is his dark spots

379
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
his places where the Sun doesn't come and and

380
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,760
Just gets uglier and grosser and and eventually women are just gonna be like, ah, fuck it

381
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,080
And they're gonna give up too. And then we're just gonna be a big

382
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,680
Stupid ugly planet of people. Well, this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with lesbians

383
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,120
Ugly ugly lesbians. No sexy lesbians and ugly dudes beautiful sexy lesbians that can't procreate to save their lives take over

384
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,640
Aren't they they are shit. They are

385
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,920
There's only one generation of them. How can we make this work for us?

386
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,360
You gotta get on board now cuz I don't wanna be the first one against the wall. I tell you what friends with the lesbians

387
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,320
That's what I do. I'll tell you the really scary thing

388
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,960
The really scary thing is that there's someone out there listen to this and they're like, yes

389
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
They have it all figured out. They crack the code

390
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,360
These McElroy brothers, they know what's up. They're being serious about the things they talk about. They know what's going on

391
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,000
Hey, and then we're on our way to a Nobel Prize

392
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,120
Nobel Prize here we go. Except the one person who thinks that is the Nobel Prize guy

393
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Hi, this is dr. Nobel Prize

394
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,840
I like your thesis on lesbians. Yeah, lesbians and in the world

395
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,440
This is what this is why it's so sexy when girls make out is because you're looking at something dark and apocalyptic something

396
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,200
That you can't possibly fathom the gravity of you're touching the darkness

397
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
You've reached across the veil to see your end

398
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Through the void!

399
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Through the void! These girls are making out and you can see the inside

400
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,200
You're bathed in a lost arc like glow as your face melts off

401
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Do you guys think it's gonna happen in our lifetime?

402
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
God, we can only hope

403
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I hope so, that's the sexiest thing I've ever heard

404
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I want that to be the last thing I see

405
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I know, right? This is a chorus of girls making out

406
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,200
My wife and I...

407
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Hey, do you remember before the show? When you were like, we have a lot of women listeners and we need to not

408
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
This is why!

409
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
This is why! Cause they love this

410
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
They're like, that was so sexy

411
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Right now they're thinking about that, right now they're like, wow, what a sexy apocalypse

412
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
What if we just started the apocalypse?

413
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
We just planted the seed in everyone's head

414
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Planted the seed of the apocalypse

415
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Planted the seed in everyone's head

416
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Planted the seed of the apocalypse

417
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Everybody knows Ellen did that

418
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,200
My wife and I have an ongoing argument about the proper way to say you're making a room cooler

419
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
For example, she'll say I'm going to turn...

420
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Okay, I say I'm going to turn the AC up

421
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Whereas she believes you should say I'm turning the air down

422
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Come on, what's wrong with her?

423
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,200
She's gotta know that I'm right and she's just BSing because she doesn't want to admit it, right?

424
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
What do you guys say? I'm trying to think

425
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Divorce

426
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Yeah

427
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
It's the only answer

428
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
No, no

429
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
I think I say I turn it, if it's too cold

430
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I always say up

431
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,200
If I'm making it colder in the room, I'm going to turn it up

432
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I'm going to turn the AC up

433
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Right

434
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Yeah

435
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Yeah, that makes sense

436
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah, that makes sense

437
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Or I'll say I'll turn the thermostat up

438
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
And that means it's getting hotter

439
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
This is a really complex question

440
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
There needs to be some sort of standard

441
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Let's create

442
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
I always just yell, I'm going to turn up the heat

443
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
And then I slam dunk

444
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Just be like, if you say it's too hot in this bitch, I'm going to fix it

445
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Then people know what you're talking about, like they know what you're going to do

446
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
And then now this bitch is too cold

447
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
This bitch is cold

448
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold, you might say

449
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Fix how chilly this bitch is

450
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I can't stop thinking about the end of the world

451
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Let's just take it to I'm going to adjust this

452
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Take out all the prepositions

453
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Oh, so it's sort of universal

454
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
It could go either way at that point

455
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I'm going to alter the temperature in here, buckle up

456
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I don't know what's going to happen

457
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm going to affect this

458
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,200
So I want to get

459
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Jesus Christ

460
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Do they just get weirder?

461
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Are we just turning into insane people as we record this show?

462
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
We're doing the show earlier and earlier

463
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
And I think that probably has an effect on it

464
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
We need to stop doing it at 2.30 in the morning

465
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,200
So I want to hear Griffin's last question that he's prepared for us

466
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,200
But first I want to tell you how you can seek our guidance

467
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,200
And maybe be told that you are A, a lesbian

468
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Or B, a pedophile

469
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
These are the services we offer here

470
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,200

We're slipping a little bit off of the iTunes page

515
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
