1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:50,880
It's the most wonderful time of the year. No, there's no movie watches.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,400
There's no holidays to report on. No friends, it's much better than that.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:05,680
It's Max Fun Week, a week-long celebration of all things related to the Maximum Fun Network.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Now, I want to clarify here, because I've seen some people, you know, you talk about Max Fun Week,

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,800
and everybody goes, oh, another pledge drive, but here's the thing.

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,640
Shut the fuck up.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
Yeah, also, shut up, wiener.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
No, I'm towing a hard line. You just assume every holiday that we cook up and invent,

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,560
is a ploy for us to get money from you, but no, I'll go eat a bag of butts.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Yeah, sorry. Some things are just about human joy, creating human joy. That's where we're at,

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
and that's what the Maximum Fun Network is all about, and that's what we're doing this week.

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
There's been already a bevy, can I say a bevy?

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,000
You can.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Is that fair? A bevy of activities.

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,640
A flurry.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,240
A flurry, I guess, yeah, you could go with that, as part of the Max Fun Week celebration,

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,280
and there is more to come. Today, it's worth noting, is Share Your Favorite Episode Day,

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
so pick your favorite Max Fun show.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
It's gonna be this one. I just know it's gonna be this one.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
It's gonna be this one, and share your favorite episode with somebody.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Maybe you like it classic. Maybe Spaghetti Gatton's your favorite episode.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe you like one of the live ones. Those are the only two I can remember.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
Or maybe you're branching out, and you wanna say that your favorite episode is the episode

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
of Jordan Jesse Go! I was on, or the episode of Lady 2 Lady I was on.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh, wow.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Branching out, but into very specific Travis-based directions.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,120
Or maybe the episode of Wham Bam Pow I was on.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
Oh, wow. Travis, are you the most prolific Maximum Fun guest, do you think, at this point?

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
You think you've been on the most number of Maximum Fun shows?

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,960
Let me think. Yes.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Probably.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,960
I need to get on Sawbones. I need to find an N there.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah, good luck. Maximum Fun dot org, four slash Max Fun Week is where you can go to

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
read all about the activities. There's still a lot more to come.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
There's also a, depending on when this publishes, oh, yeah, there'll be time.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,320
There is an Ask Me Anything with Jesse and Jordan at two.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,640
These are Pacific times, by the way, at two.

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,480
Julie from Destination DIY is doing one at four.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
And Lisa and Emily from Baby Genius is doing one at six.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,760
So, get there.

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Which, by the way, if you haven't checked out the new shows,

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
check out Destination DIY, check out Flophouse, and I'm now the producer

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
for Baby Geniuses, so triple check that out.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,120
Whoa.

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
What's with this, what's with, what's with your whole steez lately?

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah, you're really getting, if I can say above your raisin,

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
I feel like you're getting above your raisin right now.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Listen, I'm elevated. I'm a new man. I'm on my grind. I'm on my grind.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Driver's on his grind is the worst.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,200
Can we find a happy medium between Justin and I having no grind to speak of whatsoever

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,520
and you having like an extreme grind?

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,480
Do we need like a medium grind, like for drip coffee?

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
Shouldn't you legally have to spend some of your grind, grinding for us? It seems like.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm on that twerk. I'm on that twerk. I'm twerking, I'm twerking for my personal brand.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
Listen, listen.

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680
That's my butt cheeks.

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,160
Is that your butt?

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,920
That's your butt slapping against your butt.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,360
That's my butt cheeks clapping.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
For you, saying, hey, good job.

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
For you, saying great job. You did a really great job on the one podcast you're on.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
That's not true. I'm actually on Judge John Hodgman this week.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,680
We've got a massive guest. Speaking of, we've got a massive guest.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,880
He is 900 feet tall and he's made entirely out of granite.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440
It's Judge John Hodgman. That's going to happen soon, so get ready.

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
I mean, Judge John Hodgman is a character that he plays.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,760
We got him. We went behind the scenes and we got the man behind.

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,160
The man who's obsessed with Bowser from Sean on Off.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
Oh, guys.

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Stay tuned.

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
Until then, let's do some questions and help some people.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
If somebody sneezes in the bathroom stall next to you, should you say bless you?

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
I was recently in a bathroom and I sneezed.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,680
The other person in the stall did not say bless you.

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Okay, wait.

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm assuming that you don't mean in the stall with you because that would be rude.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
Someone in the stall touching me sneezed.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Someone's staring at me, waiting to hand me a hot towel.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
Then I thought maybe I was being too judgmental.

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
However, the lady didn't wash her hands.

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Three exclamation points.

86
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,440
So I'm not really sure what the proper etiquette would be since this lady obviously didn't have any.

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
That's from Megan.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,220
Well, I...

89
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:22,320
First of all, Megan, I want to compliment you on your full in-depth study of this woman.

90
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
She didn't say bless you, but she also didn't wash her hands, so it kind of balances out.

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,520
We have been penalized so many times in this program for rushing to judgment,

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,200
and I want to celebrate you for not doing that.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,840
You could have just said, wow, what a jerk, but you decided to go John Quinones

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,480
and really explore the whole situation that this woman was encompassing,

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,640
rather than just saying you're a bad person.

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,040
You have a whole in-depth investigation, which I really celebrate.

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,640
And it's really fortunate that you didn't rush to judgment and say this person is such a jerk

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,880
because you would have been dead wrong.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,400
Griffin is correct.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,120
It is my opinion that when someone is inside the actual stall itself, they cease to exist to you.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
And it's weird, right?

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,560
Because, and obviously I'm saying this as a dude,

103
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
and this is not so much a thing that a woman would experience,

104
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,840
but when you're next to each other at the urinal, it is a very communal place.

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,480
It is a place of bonding and fellowship, I would say.

106
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,400
And then in the stalls, you are buried 800 feet underground in a big, big safe.

107
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
It is the reason that if I were out of sync

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
and somebody asked me to hand them a paper towel, not a deal at all.

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
But when someone asks for toilet paper,

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,000
because it's this like, yes, for some reason.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
So it makes me, the very idea of it gives me heart palpitations.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,600
If you responded to that in any life situation,

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
someone is going to try to put a spoon on your tongue,

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,800
assuming that you're having a spoon.

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Why did I ask?

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Oh, curse me.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,560
You can't.

118
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
You can't make any noise in there.

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
It's a silent safe zone.

120
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
It's practically a church.

121
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,040
Upsetting conduct that I have witnessed, well, not witnessed obviously,

122
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,600
but well, maybe, yeah, ear witnessed from people in stalls,

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,840
but number one, and this one kills me, is the listening to music from your phone.

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,800
While you're going for it.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
I was in a toilet at a restaurant the other day

126
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
and I was in a stall next to a guy who was shopping for ringtones.

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
It's pretty cool.

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
It was a pretty cool scene.

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
I mean, when the fuck else do you get?

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
Justin, where do you find the time to build your personal brand?

131
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,480
Yeah, try to figure out how you express yourself to the world.

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
You're missing time.

133
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,520
Where else are you going to shop for ringtones though, right?

134
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Like if you're hanging out with friends and loved ones,

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
that's not a time to do it.

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
You're at a picnic.

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,600
No, I'm going to go play froth.

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm not going to shop for ringtones.

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
It is a good point though.

140
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,720
I think the only thing that would be more embarrassing to do in public

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
than defecate would be to try to pick the ringtone

142
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
that best fits your personal style.

143
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
So stressful.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,960
I am honestly, I'm too embarrassed to do that anymore.

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
I've got like a pretty standard issue beep going on now.

146
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
I stumbled on in my last phone.

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:37,200
I had the immortal Koji Kondo theme to the Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island theme.

148
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Fun little ditty.

149
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Nothing gets better than that though.

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
One of the things I was most impressed by when I was in Scotland,

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
I mean, along with the beautiful vistas and all of that,

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
was that their bathroom stall doors close in such a way that there are no gaps.

153
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
Like you can't see through them.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Like you can't hear in Heathen America.

155
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
But I've never witnessed any kind of soundproofing in a stall.

156
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
And that's what you want.

157
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
I would rather soundproof than sightproof those things.

158
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,040
You know what I mean?

159
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Maybe some baffling.

160
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,920
Some nice baffling.

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,040
Oh, sure.

162
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
Inexpensive acoustic treatment.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
I don't think that's too much to ask.

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,720
No, now you will need to set fire to it once a day.

165
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
And replace it.

166
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,680
That phone.

168
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
That phone remembers.

169
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,840
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

170
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,040
Yes.

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Absolutely.

172
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
This one was sent in by Yadru Answers shaman Drew Davenport.

173
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
Thank you, Drew.

174
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
It's by Yadru Answers user, Emily, who asks,

175
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,400
what can I be for Halloween at work?

176
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,480
I have to wear my Papa John's shirt and hat, but not the pants.

177
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
We can wear makeup.

178
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
He was a pants-less employee.

179
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
We can go as a fired employee.

180
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
We could wear makeup or anything else.

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,520
I also have the whiteout zombie contacts, too.

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,120
What?

183
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
One Yahoo Answers user named Liz responded,

184
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
be a zombie and wear scary makeup.

185
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
Thanks, you shithead.

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,520
You don't think they looked at their constituent components

187
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,640
of zombie eyes and scary makeup and didn't think,

188
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
well, let's just do that?

189
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,840
They're trying to think outside the bun

190
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,600
and they're trying to fucking fold a no-pants situation in here.

191
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Or clever pants, right?

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
Can you be Papa John's employee from the waist up,

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
mandated by Papa John himself,

194
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,200
but something else from the waist down?

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
You could be like a pizza mermaid.

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,080
Or pizza centaur, I think would be really great.

197
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Pizza centaur.

198
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
Now you will need a friend for this.

199
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,520
You will need a friend with eight hours to kill.

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
And a strong back.

201
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
It's very strong back.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
He's gonna be down by that pizza heat, too,

203
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,400
so he needs to have a high tolerance.

204
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,480
What if the pizza centaur was the one delivering the pizzas?

205
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,960
That would be quite the show to see in your driveway.

206
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
But they, I mean, they would eat it.

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
Could you wear, could you find a friend who's a-

208
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,040
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

209
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
Griffin, centaurs do not just eat any pizza

210
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
put in front of them.

211
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Why would you assume that?

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,880
They can't.

213
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
They're fucking crazy for this one.

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,520
No, they're very well-behaved.

215
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,400
No, not around pizza.

216
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,760
They're people just like us.

217
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Read my fucking novel.

218
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
Read my young, my youth adult books.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,880
My youth adult books.

220
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
Read Griffin's series of YA fiction, Cintines.

221
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
The story of centaur teens trying to,

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
who've traveled here from the Equestriaverse.

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,160
The main character, Buck, is probably my favorite.

224
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,480
Yeah.

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,280
Oh God, guys, we're gonna lose the big skateboard meet.

226
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,800
All right, get me skateboards.

227
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
Two of them, because I got four legs.

228
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,220
Whoa.

229
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Whoa.

230
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,580
Did, could you ask a friend who works at Pizza Hut

231
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,020
if you could borrow their pants?

232
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,900
And then just everybody comes in and just be like, get it?

233
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,700
Wait a minute.

234
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,020
Do you get it?

235
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
All right, can I get a personal pan pizza?

236
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,380
Wait a minute, you don't do that here.

237
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,500
I thought it was in Pizza Hut because of your crazy pants.

238
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,540
What's going on here?

239
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,580
Is this some sort of prank?

240
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,940
Pizza pizza, right?

241
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,660
Oh boy.

242
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,180
You could dress up like, you could dress up your face

243
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,100
like the guy in all the Papa John cover.

244
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,060
Is his name just John?

245
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,940
Can we establish what his fucking-

246
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,420
No, I think his name is Papa John.

247
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,380
It's John.

248
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm Papa John.

249
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,060
You could dress up like that dude in the face department,

250
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,140
which is to say like the most heavily caked on makeup

251
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,940
you've ever seen on a dude on television.

252
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
Oh my God, oh my God.

253
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,620
His face extends out like four and a half extra inches

254
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,060
from his regular face.

255
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,220
He looks like he's wearing like one of those sad old clown masks.

256
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,940
Oh, he's wearing like dark man skin.

257
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,740
We obviously don't have as many like CEOs

258
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,220
in their commercials I think as we used to.

259
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,900
You know, you don't have the Dave Thomas's

260
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,700
or Ron McDonald, not a lot in the commercials anymore.

261
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,100
But don't you think that at a certain point

262
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,020
you would be in enough commercials

263
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,620
that you would achieve like a base level of competency

264
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,060
with being in a commercial?

265
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,500
Like at some point you would begin to grow

266
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,860
as a commercial performer?

267
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I would argue that Papa John has gone

268
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,500
the opposite direction.

269
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,380
No, and I think that's just because he's resting

270
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,060
more and more control with each commercial he's in.

271
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,660
And I think very recently he became in charge

272
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
of the makeup department and he says,

273
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,860
I just want a little touch up.

274
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,380
Also, can you make my eyes look like

275
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,940
that crazy Richard Alpert guy from Lost?

276
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,820
Terrific, thank you very much.

277
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Do you think maybe the problem is that when he's up there

278
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,660
and he's performing with a heavy hitter,

279
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,140
like a Peyton Manning, it's just really hard for him

280
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,700
to like step up to that same level of acting proficiency?

281
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,140
Yeah, that's exactly what Peyto is bringing to the mix.

282
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,900
Peyton is another good example of somebody

283
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,260
who is belligerently not getting any better

284
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,620
at being in commercials.

285
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,380
He's in every commercial and he refuses to learn anything.

286
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,060
It's stubbornly bad.

287
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,740
If I was in as many football matches

288
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,140
as a Peyton Manning has been commercials,

289
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,980
at this point I would be throwing the occasional INT,

290
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,700
but I think I'd be putting up a decent fantasy performance.

291
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,060
What if it's like when you're like an actor

292
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,460
who's known for that and it's like he has improved,

293
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,940
he's actually got like a degree from Juilliard now,

294
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,020
but they're like, no, just be the Peyton

295
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,300
for the Subway commercial.

296
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,060
And he's like, but I really want to like expand.

297
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,620
I want to like-

298
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,940
If you insist, I shall put on the ruse.

299
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,980
Come on down to Papa Job's pizza palace.

300
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,060
Did you say pizza with a B?

301
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,940
I don't know, man.

302
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,660
Touchdown.

303
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,820
Eli, come here and catch a fat slice.

304
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,740
We don't like to call them fat slices.

305
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,780
It's not appetizing verbiage, Peyto.

306
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,420
Did you call it a pizza palace?

307
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,960
Yep.

308
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,460
I'm gonna get my whole, all my colts around.

309
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,780
We're gonna slam some pizzas together.

310
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,860
Here's your $5 million.

311
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,220
Thank you very much.

312
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,940
I needed that.

313
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
I'll put it on top of the other $6 million

314
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,500
that I earned this week for all my touchdown throws.

315
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,940
And he thinks he still thinks he plays for the Colts?

316
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,420
Yeah.

317
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,020
That's upsetting too.

318
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,260
That's the character of Peyton he plays on TV.

319
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,700
Okay.

320
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,380
Every horse-based team falls under a single umbrella for him.

321
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,060
He did do that, didn't he?

322
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,740
Yeah, this motherfucker's crazier about horses than we are.

323
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,180
And I didn't think that was possible.

324
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
What about the Washington Centaurs?

325
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
I would root for that team hands down.

326
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,900
You guys know that there's a team called the Washington Redskins.

327
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,180
You heard about that, right?

328
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,380
I've heard of it, yes.

329
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,780
Okay.

330
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,100
Do you know that I, the owner of a three and three fantasy football team,

331
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,660
am not at this moment sure if that is Washington State or Washington DC?

332
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,540
Here's the interesting fact.

333
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,820
Hand to God, I don't know.

334
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,780
It's a timeshare.

335
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,580
It's both.

336
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,020
It's both, Peyton.

337
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,900
Okay.

338
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,660
They're like sister city states.

339
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,540
And they said like, we'll go in on this together

340
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,580
because each of them couldn't afford a full team by themselves.

341
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,260
So they split the cost right down the middle.

342
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,460
How mad must Washington DC have been when they hurt?

343
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,340
Because you know that news took a long time to travel back then.

344
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Those motherfuckers called the state what?

345
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,820
They called it what?

346
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,580
I wanted them to call it Oregon, but up some more.

347
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,100
And that was my original name.

348
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,180
I don't see what's wrong with Oregon, but up some more.

349
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,700
But fine, fuck it, whatever.

350
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,100
They called it Washington too, at least, right?

351
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,820
My husband and I recently moved into our first home in a neighborhood

352
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,460
that has a lot of elementary and middle school age kids.

353
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,380
My memories of middle school suggest we should be at least a little on guard

354
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,260
for mailbox bashing, TPed trees, and other mild hooliganism.

355
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,500
How can we plan our candy costume or exterior decor situation to deter

356
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,660
pranking if there is no stopping the tricksters,

357
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,580
which we did prepare ourselves in our home for the aftermath?

358
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,620
That's from please just take the candy and go.

359
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,460
Can I say something?

360
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I feel like if your house gets forked, do you guys know about forking?

361
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,780
No, I'm not aware of forking.

362
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,300
You steal all your forks.

363
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,860
No, you get a bunch of plastic forks and you like jam them into their yard.

364
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,020
And kill all the groundhogs.

365
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,180
No, no, no, it's not.

366
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,060
It's just there's forks there now where there weren't forks before.

367
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,100
Now there's forks.

368
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,380
It's not just if you get forked or you get mailbox bashed or you get TPed or egged.

369
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,740
I would consider that a refreshing spring breeze compared to like the game

370
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,820
that teens are pulling down in today's modern era.

371
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,300
You know what I mean?

372
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,420
Like if I'm saying this Halloween, like people are going to go door to door

373
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,100
and like fucking docks people and release their bank account number

374
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,980
and like somehow get a picture of everyone's dicks

375
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,340
and post it on your fucking next door forum board.

376
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,740
And then that's that's the equivalent.

377
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,940
That's where we're at nowadays.

378
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,580
I'm saying that this mild hooliganism has turned into like full blown identity theft.

379
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,180
In real life.

380
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,780
I mean, in movies, they always show it being so like upsetting when someone gets TPed.

381
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,620
But I think that like I think it's almost kind of flattering in a way.

382
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,540
Because it's like, hey, you're involved in this now.

383
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,500
So annoying.

384
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,940
Have you ever had to get it off, though?

385
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,940
Oh, no, you just leave it.

386
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,900
Until the birds come get it.

387
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh, the birds take it away and build a nest.

388
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,540
And they wipe their ass.

389
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,700
Dirty birds.

390
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,820
I really liked when a couple of kids who we did community theater with tried to TP our house

391
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,540
and then Todd, our huge, huge, huge neighbor, yelled at them and chased them off.

392
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,300
Take that kids.

393
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,180
Take that little kids.

394
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,220
Get out of here.

395
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,420
Is giving away good candy still like a solid defense against this?

396
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,540
But that's extortion at that point, right?

397
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,580
You're giving into it.

398
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,340
You're negotiating.

399
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,260
You're negotiating with baby terrorists.

400
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,500
You turn the extortion around and you say like, listen, I bought you full sized candy bars this

401
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,820
year.

402
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,620
Yeah, you enjoy that?

403
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,260
You like that?

404
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,940
Would you like this train to keep it rolling?

405
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Well, I guess that's up to you.

406
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,340
I think you're just perpetuating climate of fear.

407
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,140
Still extortion.

408
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:15,380
I would love to get egged if it meant I didn't have to get doxxed every fucking week and have

409
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,380
to move every week and establish new passwords every week and just like explain to people,

410
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,300
no, that's not my dick every week.

411
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,660
That would be excellent if we could avoid that.

412
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,780
That would be fantastic if we could just not have that for one.

413
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,940
Just give me one week's respite, please.

414
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,300
You should just talk to your neighbors and see if this is actually an issue because I'm

415
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,980
willing to bet it's not as bad as you think it is.

416
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,340
Keep a porch light on.

417
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,100
Don't leave your pumpkin on the front porch.

418
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,820
You know, I don't know.

419
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,140
You're saying don't celebrate Halloween essentially.

420
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,540
No, no, no.

421
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,660
Just at the end of the night, like bring it inside.

422
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,660
For some reason, that's the big concern to me.

423
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,340
Someone might smash my pumpkin.

424
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,860
I think they're doing you, if they do that after sugar treat, they're doing you a favor.

425
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,660
I think.

426
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,780
You know what's great in Austin is that they'll smash your pumpkin and then they'll start a

427
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,060
compost heap in your front yard.

428
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,780
So considerate.

429
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,060
It's super considerate, yeah.

430
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,180
Sinks like shit, though.

431
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,900
You guys want a Yahoo?

432
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,180
Absolutely.

433
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,940
This Yahoo was sent in by Michael Allen.

434
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,740
Thank you, Michael Allen.

435
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,260
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mr. Lizards who asks,

436
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,460
what should I name my new restaurant that only serves leftovers from other restaurants?

437
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,820
I am hoping to open a successful restaurant and I just need a good name.

438
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,860
Here's the concept.

439
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,380
There's nothing better than eating a delicious meal at a nice restaurant and having enough

440
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,060
to take home and eat later.

441
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,560
Doubles.

442
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,140
My restaurant will serve leftovers from other restaurants so you can experience that joy

443
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,980
without the trouble of having to go to the other restaurant in the first place.

444
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,540
I plan to offer a premium menu with options from places like Olive Garden, Applebee's,

445
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,500
and Red Lobster, as well as value items like Pizza Hut pizza or Mcdonald's.

446
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,700
Burgers and Fries.

447
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,940
It is a very wise business model because I will not have the expense startup costs of

448
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,980
ovens or grills.

449
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,060
I'll just need an extra large walk-in cooler and a few microwaves.

450
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,740
Here are some names I'm considering.

451
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,700
Good Re- Good Re- Eats.

452
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,740
Twice Baked.

453
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,620
Lefto- Leftovers.

454
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,900
This is my favorite so far.

455
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,500
Please let me know if you need additional info to come up with a good name.

456
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,980
The middle man.

457
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,940
The middle man.

458
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,300
That's not bad.

459
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,780
Shloppy Seconds.

460
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,620
Shloppy Seconds is pretty good too.

461
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,980
Time slash money waster.

462
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,220
Can we figure out if this is actually going to be a viable business decision?

463
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,300
Because I at first blush I thought about it and I said well the the overhead there is

464
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,580
going to be outrageous right you're you are you are spending more money on the food you're

465
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:57,460
paying for other restaurants's labor right and then you're you're in the worst markup

466
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,340
position you could possibly be but at the same time you're gonna fucking eat that stuff

467
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:09,300
anyway so the thing the thing is the thing this question asker is missing the the core

468
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,220
principle of why leftovers are so great because you pay for the meal once and you eat it twice

469
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,100
it's not that the cold day old food is so much better than the new stuff but imagine

470
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,740
actually introduced another set of hands someone else has touched this thing i it's it's it's

471
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:35,140
i don't think it's a terrible idea and here's why my favorite food items at restaurants across the

472
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,340
the great city of austin texas uh are just that all across the great city of austin texas if i

473
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:46,820
could bring them all together into one super restaurant oh fuck yeah oh man get my favorite

474
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,180
dessert from from from the salty sal and get some some sushi from uchiko man actually you don't

475
00:22:52,180 --> 00:23:00,260
really want no secondhand but let me poke a few holes in this plan one like okay so say you want

476
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,980
a ten dollar hamburger from tgi friday's right if this place has that they're going to have to

477
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:13,860
charge you more so you're going to be paying more for older food no no you're then how are they

478
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,860
going to make money no no you're missing you're misunderstanding i go to tgi here's here's the

479
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,100
business model i go to tgi friday's i get my favorite ten dollar burger in the world and i

480
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,980
eat half of it and then i take that to the to sloppy seconds and maybe they give me 250 for it

481
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:35,780
then they reheat it resell it for seven it's like a food pawn shop i would insist on consignment

482
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:41,620
though yeah can i come back and get the rest of the burger later you hold on this burger for 30

483
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,700
days the only uh one of the advantages i could see to sloppy seconds would be that i could buy

484
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,740
chick-fil-a with a clean conscience they have filtered the hate through sloppy seconds although

485
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,900
the owner of this place is probably a hateful person too let's be honest but i i could filter

486
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,100
it i could have some plausible deniability there it was already bought well this is from oh my god

487
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,500
i had no i i mean it did taste like soggy like pickle chicken so i should have known i'm just

488
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,380
picturing a desperate person like at the counter saying because these are good french fries man

489
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,700
these are good friends i paid top for these french fries and there travis you've just pulled

490
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,780
the linchpin out and the whole thing just fucking fell apart because this restaurant cannot possibly

491
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,100
under any circumstances sell french fries just can't exactly can't be done and old nachos old

492
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,380
nachos especially no no and french fries no the whole thing is just terrible

493
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,060
i would probably eat there you probably would because you're a fucking

494
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,340
sarlacc in the shape of a man you're a sarlacc and cowboy boots

495
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
uh can we go ahead and go the money zone i think we should

496
00:24:49,540 --> 00:25:04,420
good news mr rough face i really i've asked you several times to stop calling me that it's not

497
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,940
my it's hurtful there's one solution though uh for your rough face you don't even only one

498
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,220
finally good news everyone someone invented the razor my brother my brother and me is

499
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:24,980
supported by harry's.com the place that invented finally the razor i don't think that's 100%

500
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,260
true harry's delivers a better by which i mean first shaving experience for a fraction of the

501
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,460
price of their competitors of which there are none so did they name them after the fucking scooters

502
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:46,420
then yes named after the popular yet defunct method of transport teen transportation uh the

503
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:52,740
company makes amazing german engineered uh razors i don't know why we have to specify

504
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:59,780
german engineered as they're the only uh items of their kind i myself have shaved with uh the

505
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:06,660
world's first razor and i can say that it was a smooth shaving experience actually you know what i

506
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:13,300
got uh this week they sent harry sent me some uh some additional shaving products there was some

507
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,940
aftershave lotion from harry's which i've never tried before and i actually used this morning

508
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,660
and i found the scent delectable so you're saying i no longer just have to burn all the hair off

509
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,500
my face every other day no don't get that that comically oversized magnifying glass out to try

510
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,020
to burn individual hairs like so many ants crawling across the scape of your visage but i

511
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,180
kind of like i kind of like the way it feels now would you say it works better than wishing the

512
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:44,900
hair off yes it does it works better than all other methods this is a how does it work well

513
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:54,260
here let me describe it for 15 you will get a uh a stick uh-huh you will get some cream okay you'll

514
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,220
put the cream on your face you will get it's flammable cream and it helps burn the hair no

515
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:06,900
it's not in any way playable you'll get three sharp metallic wishing cream wishing cream smear

516
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:16,900
it on your face it's a wishing cream by men and there's no wishing cream uh this is wishing

517
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:23,540
cream by men and i fucking brought it off my tv once i think that that is a competing shave

518
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,700
place that you probably shouldn't mention in a harry's ad oh can i what if i say it sucks dick

519
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,620
what doesn't exist in the fiction of the ad you for 50 you get a handle a stick to put the sharp

520
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,820
things on you get three blades which are sharp metallic like flat things that you scrape across

521
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,540
your face and it makes the hair die like railroad rails they're like flat railroad rails that you

522
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:54,580
scrape across your face 15 bucks for that and you get three different blades so the the one downside

523
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:00,500
of razors that they're hoping to fix in the coming months is that they eventually dull over time but

524
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,460
there are three blades now so you can swap them out once they get a little dull and you don't get

525
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,700
that smooth shaving experience and they even offer custom engraving so you can get the handle of your

526
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:16,340
razor engraved with your initials it's convenient and it's easy to order online go to harry's.com

527
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:21,780
and use the promo code my brother all one word and harry's is going to give you five dollars off

528
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,780
your first purchase of the first razor for all my brother my brother me listeners what a deal we

529
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:33,220
also are sponsored this week by prosper who has sponsored us before and it's a super cool idea in

530
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,780
my opinion and basically what it is you go to prosper.com it's a peer-to-peer lending site

531
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,780
so the idea is is that rather than go to a bank rather than go to some big faceless bank that

532
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,580
doesn't give two shits about you you go to prosper.com and it's other people just like you

533
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,060
lending you the money my bank said they love me your bank does not love you they love you like

534
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:03,060
like a grain in the ocean they don't give two literal shits about you but you can borrow up

535
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,620
to thirty five thousand dollars from prosper but here's the thing they also do smaller loans too

536
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,620
because if you're like me you think about the thirty five thousand and that's like an astronomical

537
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,380
imaginary number but they also do as low as twenty five hundred dollars so anywhere in

538
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,740
between that you can apply for those loans maybe you know banks give out lots of home loans they

539
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,300
give lots of car loans but maybe you're looking for something to pay off a medical bill maybe

540
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,900
you're wanting to go on a vacation maybe you're needing to pay for a honeymoon or a wedding

541
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,900
or you've got moving expenses or anything like that that maybe a bank would say well that's not

542
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,100
really the kind of thing we do well prosper does we love we love you though like i'll

543
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,780
don't love you like i'll fucking buy that again they wish you were dead and here's the thing you

544
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,980
can apply online you never have to set foot in a bank you just go to prosper.com apply online you

545
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:00,100
can check your rate instantly without affecting your your credit then go to prosper.com slash

546
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,620
my brother if you get a loan you get fifty dollar gift card check it out you want to do uh you want

547
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:12,500
to do this in the style of jimmy buffett maybe just like how you think he talks give me one

553
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,620
going to prosper to get some dough

554
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:08,340
some people claim that i'm not worth the risk and they're right

555
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,020
i'm not worth the risk

556
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:22,420
all right so and we're gonna just keep on we're gonna get through all this together

557
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:28,340

560
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:51,060
it's actually rosio domo luke says to rosio domo you thought i couldn't outdo last year's present

561
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:57,060
of infiltrating chinatown and buying pokemon x and y before the street date well bam here's our

562
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:03,220
favorite brothers breaking the street date on our love people may mistake us for siblings on the reg

563
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,620
but we should probably still make out catch you later banana mater catch you later banana mater

564
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:15,140
i did it faster that time and are you ready to have your minds blown we are delivering this on

565
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:22,020
the day oh nice um well don't say that because we're recording this pretty far ahead of time

566
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,100
and i mean no it's correct on the 20th we're not just i'm just saying anything could happen

567
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:33,300
okay well happy uh what's that anniversary love is that what it is birthday birthday all right well

568
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,940
that's good whatever i'm not sure it's one of those things it's unclear happy celebration birthday

569
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,380
it's last year's present so i don't know it's i don't know the occasion i'm saying this luke sounds

570
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:55,060
like a uh no you just read ahead didn't you we're gonna get to that but don't don't rain on luke

571
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,060
and cutie patootie's parade um i think it sounds like luke is a kind of a no limit soldier because

572
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:10,340
he he could have gone to pokemon jail for breaking that street date yeah and it's hard in there geo

573
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,940
dude doing pull-ups but you can wear shorts you can they're comfortable and easy that is true

574
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,540
justin go ahead and i mean you ruined the fucking go ahead and read it justin who is this message

575
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:27,140
for tom reagan who's this message from future tom reagan what is your message having two dicks

576
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:38,580
turned out really great how far in the future is tom reagan is it is it is this a minority report

577
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:45,940
situation did a pre did a pre-cock god step forward and and reveal to him an ill omen because

578
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:53,540
this is it's from future not present day tom to past tom this is future tom to present day tom

579
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:59,380
and it's not past tom or current tom reaching out to future tom asking about two dicks uh-huh

580
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,540
because somewhere in the future tom has achieved or had added two dicks it turned out really great

581
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,740
so present tom if you're listening and you're debating a major dick decision i think you know

582
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:19,940
which way to go is this coded i hope not you just hope it's you're taking a face value his face is

583
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,740
the least of his concerns right now sure having two dicks could have gone either way but it turned

584
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:31,460
out really great mark your calendars for a brand new thing the first ever max fun week is coming up

this is john hodgeman in new york city i have profound affection for all three of you

591
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,260
and i think that i figured out which one belonged to which name about one year ago

592
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:22,260
oh and and or maybe even six months ago i think i asked jesse could you just walk me through it

593
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,340
and he sat me down he sat me down in some in front of some headshots and we got it done

594
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,940
but you just barely beat out our dad actually i have no i have no no visual to go with your

595
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,540
voices so if i get confused between who's talking i apologize john you can picture me however you

596
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:47,220
want that was travis nailed it that all right that last one was justin wow and then wow that

597
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,260

600
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:12,100
ow i'm sorry to have brought up mr baseman so quickly but gentlemen how swiftly can we move

601
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:18,180
into the eternal mystery of sha na na on this program because this is i got home from my night

602
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:27,940
shoot on a on a non-television program at uh at 1 a.m and and and with the intention of eating

603
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,300
seven slices of pizza and going to bed immediately and while i got the seven slices of pizza down

604
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:41,140
i then had to go into a deep sha na na hole because my good friend david reese had had finally

605
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,620
uh convinced me not he didn't he convinced me at the beginning but i finally got around

606
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:52,820
to on his recommendation to listening to the great uh andy daley uh podcast project episode

607
00:36:52,820 --> 00:37:00,660
wolfman hot dog which involves andy daley's character famous waterskier hot dog largely

608
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,540
talking about his obsession with sha na na and i had not thought about sha na na in a long time

609
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,940
and now that is all i can think about so i apologize in advance well and now you spread

610
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,700
that through the consciousness of our millions of of fans yeah into that you've you've injected

611
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:22,740
your serum into the hive mind yeah what is your listenership is uh is fantastic it's it's something

612
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,660
it's 35 million is that correct at this time it was 30 it's 36 million this week we had a we had

613
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,900
a really bang up thanks it really turned around since we let chuck lorry take the show over wow

614
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:43,220
well good for you uh good for you we're joined by john hodgeman uh this is my brother my brother

615
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,380
me and rather than uh you know just spout on prattle endlessly we thought we oh are we going

616
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,260
to try it differently this week yeah we probably let an actual expert oh uh answer questions uh

617
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,980
the submitted by you the people uh have we established just a real ish have we established

618
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,340
and and forgive me no for this horrible this horrible horrible thing but the area of your

619
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,100
expertise my name is john hodgeman i host the judge john hodgeman podcast which is another

620
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,300
less popular podcast on the maximum fun network that's not true i have numbers that say that's

621
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,420
that's not true at all quantitatively you haven't seen my numbers well look there are different

622
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,020
numbers that can be counted what are numbers and there are three of you and there's one of

623
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,060
me so that makes you more popular i think well yes well we have to split ours three ways though

624
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,620
well look another podcast on the maximum fun network and i i'm also uh well i have had a

625
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,420
lot of jobs over the past six years much and all of them to my surprise i was on the daily show and

626
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,220
continue to be on the daily show from time to time as a contributor as the resident expert and

627
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,380
deranged millionaire on the daily show with john stewart i was in a series of computer ads for apple

628
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:02,100
computer uh which was such a wonderful job that ended now uh 35 years ago today isn't that weird

629
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:10,100
wow i'm currently i'm currently a recurring character on the fx comedy married and uh and uh

630
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,380
and i was working last night on a different uh television slash non-television program i guess

631
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,820
and a founding member of movement chance right oh if only if only it were true i did not mean

632
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,900
to intimate that our listeners did not know who you are or your your storied body of work i was

633
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:34,660
more suggesting your your the things which people walk up i walk up to you on the street yeah um uh

634
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:42,020
which is a very unlikely scenario and i say hello mr hodgeman and your brilliance blinds me

635
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:49,700
for a moment and and then i and then i would imagine my pepper spray does yes um and i say

636
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:56,340
i need you to assist me with blank right i'm just assuming it's everything at this point

637
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:02,500
well i did write a series of books of complete world knowledge and fake trivia and uh and all

638
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,900
based on my uh universal knowledge of uh everything i have made up which is largely

639
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,660
largely based on all of the shrapnel of trivia and small weird little facts that have accrued

640
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,820
in my brain over these 43 years and you griffin are but a child right you are 17 19 years old 13

641
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:29,380
13 years old big first age whoa whoa easy there big brothers just ribbon i understand but tell me

642
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:37,940
your actual chronological age uh 27 uh gregorian years yeah you're so you know we all we all pick

643
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,460
up and accrue a lot of weird facts over our years and as we get older and weirder we tend to spout

644
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,740
them with even more and more authority when i was your age i was acting like a 35 year old now i'm 43

645
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:55,860
and i'm acting like a man um sniffing the air coming up from his grave but as it is

646
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,100
i can help the youths of today because of the experience i've had as an

647
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:10,340
as a as a famous minor television personality internet judge uh and uh father and um and long

648
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:17,060
time uh monogamist we actually we actually this may surprise you john we pull down a very mature

649
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,620
crowd we pull down the the like the berks law audience you know it's basically our main

650
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,860
cross-section you know what i love about your show is that you start out by saying this is

651
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:33,780
not for kids and then you just swear and swear and swear and it it's liberate it's it's it's

652
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:40,980
liberating it's it's freaking liberating i dare say uh all right john time to put your um your

653
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,620
wisdom to the test with these uh hit questions from our listeners because they are correct answers

654
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,980
there are correct answers to these here comes the first one i recently grew out a mustache it's not

655
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,300
quite as impressive as your own masterpiece but i think it works the problem is i keep getting

656
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,260
this paranoid feeling that everyone around me thinks it's meant ironically can i stop for a

657
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:08,100
second did you say did you did you say masterpiece i said masterpiece i i wish i said mouthster

658
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,980
piece mouthster piece would be right uh do you have any tips for making it obvious that the lip

659
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,740
hair is sincere or two getting over this feeling and not giving a shit that's from hunter well no

660
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:26,820
i mean the the the exercise of growing facial hair is a existential exercise as much as it is

661
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:33,460
physical exertion at least for me that counts as physical exertion three hours a day just flexing

662
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,700
your upper lip yeah it it you what you what you appreciate when you grow a mustache is that um

663
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:46,980
um you are repulsing everyone even even even the people who love you the most the people who love

664
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:53,540
you the most will be the most uh repelled by by your hideousness because they knew they knew

665
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,060
the the best version of you which is to say pre-mustache this they certainly knew the

666
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,740
smoothest most baby-like version of you and i know you brothers all rock a bunch of different

667
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:12,020
facial hair configurations and so you know that the mustache in particular despite pockets of

668
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:18,740
of mustachism and in in very in various college educated parts of brooklyn and austin texas i

669
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:24,820
dare say where it is where it is being celebrated like a like a like a like a pre-prohibition

670
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:34,420
cocktail which is to say loathsomely the mustache is is large is largely a sim a symbol of of

671
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:43,300
middle age uh um resignation yeah sure yeah quitting is right middle age quitting

672
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,420
and and growing one the process of growing one is a is a hideous thing to watch and then when it

673
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:58,260
becomes fully uh ripened it is no better um and so what you do when you grow a mustache is that you

674
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:07,460
are undertaking a profoundly selfish journey uh to see to see what there is inside of you at least

675
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:15,220
behind your upper lip i'm trying to imagine i'm trying to imagine you in that that uh pupation

676
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,380
phase and i don't want to even try and guess what it is for you because it's different for everybody

677
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:25,220
right for sam elliot it's it's 45 seconds for michael sarah it's been it's just it's

678
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:31,940
just been going it's just been going for a long time i i cannot imagine you in did you cloister

679
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,780
yourself for the the period of time in which you were you had a um what what we affectionately call

680
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,540
a stender stash uh because it is the type of mustache of the a gentleman uh that you might

681
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:49,540
see in the west end of huntington west virginia hang on what when you had a halfway must when you

682
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,180
had a halfway what is the derivation of you know i understand the question but i think a west ender

683
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,140
a west ender okay a standard stash all right i thought i can actually answer this one for john

684
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,260
thank you you saw john hodgeman when he had he has been posting to instagram updates of his

685
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:11,780
mustache growth yeah this is a timely conversation because in in a in a fit of good taste uh i

686
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:20,020
irrationally shaved off all of my facial hair um just one week and a half ago and uh and it was

687
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,340
interesting because i i i thought well you know i i deployed every every follicle that i could over

688
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,740
the summer because i am like i am like a stender do you know what i mean you know a huntington west

689
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:39,300
virginia by any chance i've heard of it so you know what a stender is yes absolutely that's i

690
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,620
should mention that our 36 million listeners are all based in in huntington west virginia so

691
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:50,180
it's it's it's really it's really they all they all are based there but they live elsewhere

692
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,540
they come back on monday they come back to listen to our live recording of the podcast

693
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:03,380
i grow a terrible i grow a terrible beard and i was away with my family uh for most of the summer

694
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,340
outside of civilization which is to say in maine and i therefore decided to deploy every follicle

695
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,460
that i could just to see who was lurking inside of me and it turned out to be the it guy from

696
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:21,460
the church of satan and everyone got really upset everyone my family got really upset with me and

697
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,020
so i decided well you know it's been a long time i'll definitely shave off the beard and since it's

698
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:31,140
been now almost four years since i've had a mustache i don't want to feel dependent upon it

699
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,140
certainly i want to see i want to see who's in there you know who's who's behind who's behind

700
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:41,300
the curtain of hairs and i feel like that i feel like that idea of the summer camp facial hair

701
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:49,620
experience is a is a very uh um universal one so much so that i actually applied for a job at a

702
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:56,980
summer camp when i was in high school uh and the application expressly forbade uh the facial hair

703
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,100
experiment right it expressly for and i'm not sure this is not a joke it literally said on the

704
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,780
application that if you are coming in without facial hair this is now a canvas on which now

705
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,860
is facial experimentation yeah exactly we expect you to haze each other and and question your

706
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:20,580
sexuality and and and have and do experiments in human cruelty here at camp but no creeps please

707
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,140
and be sure to meet the kids from the jock camp across the lake do you want to know something

708
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:31,940
dodgeball fight we were so we were we were in in maine vacation land usa they they called it

709
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,140
vacation land that's what it's that's on the license plates and i figured out oh they they

710
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,980
they in 1820 when they invented maine they called it vacation land because they hadn't figured out

711
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:49,860
what a vacation is yet sure because they couldn't call it america's canada right exactly but so

712
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:56,580
my human son went to went to a camp on a lake a day camp and one and one day i was driving home

713
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:05,060
and he goes those kids across the lake at that other camp are such snobs and i'm like what he's

714
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:12,180
like yeah that's the rich kids camp and they are snobs did you just covertly get a small video

715
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,780
camera out and start your your found footage uh camp movie yeah yeah and that's how we that's how

716
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:26,660
we ended up driving off the road because i got on my but you know my my son uh is uh is nine years

717
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:32,740
old and has never seen meatballs he's never seen any of those movies i don't know where this is

718
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:38,900
coming from and what's interesting is at no point did i ever believe that it could be true that there

719
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,980
was a rich kids camp across the lake it was too on the nose i thought some of the older counselors

720
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:53,300
were gaslighting the kids there there have to be some sort of zoning laws about camp to camp

721
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:59,220
proximity that someone saw meatballs and said no this cannot this cannot come to pass somebody saw

722
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,260
heavyweights and said we can't let the fat camp be close to the skinny camp no no no no no no

723
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:11,780
heavyweights now you're now i'm gonna be up all night researching that thank you for getting

724
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:18,260
shunned on out of my mind but it turns out there is there's a rich kids camp across the lake and

725
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:26,820
it is like the richest of rich kids camp it is like the the sons of roy of middle eastern royalty

726
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,540
now is it possible that those kids are all actually really thoughtful and nice but everyone's

727
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,500
just like but they're snobs such snobs and the kids are really giving and sweet and like caring

728
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,060
what no no because what i mean i'm sure that there are some of them there there's there's a

729
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:48,340
good egg in every camp full of middle eastern princes but the old adage but i asked around town

730
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:54,580
they're like yeah those kids are monsters they all they wear matching they wear matching purple

731
00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:00,580
tracksuits oh the worst and they're constantly going through town and causing trouble and then

732
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:07,460
and then they have huge luxury motor coaches that take them on on trips to acadia national park and

733
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,340
such and at the end of each year they burn an owl in effigy yeah and they return to their business

734
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,860
jobs yes it's a it's the place where the the the son of a of a white man who went to yale university

735
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:27,300
can feel like a working stiff so anyway to answer your question here's the thing next question

736
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,580
here's the thing your mustache is going to look bad for a while and then it will be a mustache

737
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:40,340
and will continue to look bad well let me just say a mustache over a beard is is more provocative

738
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:47,620
than a beard the only facial hair configuration that i think invites more derision and confusion

739
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:53,700
would be an amish neck beard and nothing else which i'm working on next but all of this facial

740
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,980
hair is is basically an invitation to the world to make a bunch of dumb cracks you can't control

741
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,780
what they're going to think about your face any more than you can control what they're going to

742
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:10,180
think about your face and it is exactly what you suspect it is a journey into self-confidence

743
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:17,380
where you realize my face and is is more important than or what i want to do with my face is more

744
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,620
important than what other people think of me and i will take comfort in the fact that i will be

745
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,260
totally alone and no one will kiss me or love me for a period of time i'll shave your basketball

746
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:32,100
number in the back of your head bonk this is almost that that bit was almost one of those

747
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,980
dove commercials that always go viral that's like you are beautiful don't let anybody tell you any

748
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,420
differently i thought this was going to be our hit and then travis comes in with the basketball

749
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,180
number shit and then we lost it forever i thought we're probably going to inspire some people i'm

750
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:49,300
moving on to a new question and please can i just clarify i'm not saying that anyone is beautiful

751
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,660
i'm just saying oh no you know we're all we're all pretty we're all pretty ugly in different

752
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:00,260
ways the ones who are ugly on our faces are tend to be the lucky ones i have been a bookseller for

753
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,780
seven years not me this is the question yeah and i think my next i thought i thought you

754
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:15,940
were asking me to euthanize you and i think my next career step is probably either working at

755
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,140
a publisher or a literary agent so your first instinct wasn't too far off as a former terribly

756
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,420
famous professional literary agent do you have any suggestions on how to start are there courses

757
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,580
i should go back to school for do you just start in the mail room and see if anything opens up

758
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:36,020
i also have amicable relationships with a few decently well-known authors within my favorite

759
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,740
genre would say getting character references from them on my resume made me more enticingly

760
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:47,700
employable and that's from searching to shovel spots on the sinking ship of signature your

761
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:56,340
uh signature is extremely accurate you are you are moving from deck chair to jet chair on a

762
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:03,300
sinking ship and all of the deck chairs are on fire even the band has quit and they've escaped

763
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,980
the sinking ship yeah the the band is making apps now they're like this is stupid now look

764
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:17,220
you press here it sounds like a violin oh here's a million dollars uh but you love books and they

765
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:25,300
and you know you you can't do you can't change what you love sadly um the only problem is that

766
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,860
you have it exactly right it is essentially just start in the mail room that's what it was 20 years

767
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,900
ago when i started i did i consulted some friends of mine who are still in the book industry who are

768
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,460
in a position to hire people and first of all they're not interested in what authors you know

769
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,660
and they don't want to hire you and second uh they're like yeah we we have an internship program

770
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,340
this was at my old literary agency writer's house which is a great place you know we have

771
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,340
an internship program here we hire from our internship pool that's how you learn it's an

772
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:59,220
apprenticeship system usually young people come in will tolerate very small salaries in order to

773
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,100
be around things that they love and then they learn the business from within there are publishing

774
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,300
courses you can take the the columbia columbia has a publishing course which i think is a non-degree

775
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:16,180
course um and then nyu has a master's degree in publishing but and certainly that will put you

776
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,420
into the city where book publishing happens and put you in contact with people who are doing it

777
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:27,220
but ultimately it is a network and apprenticeship arranged business just like hollywood just like

778
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:33,060
podcast and um and i think the the warning that you have to take is that you are going to have to

779
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:40,740
start over your seven years in book selling um will aid you but will not allow you to make any kind of

780
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:46,020
lateral move you're going to have to start low they can read i assume so they have that skill

781
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,140
yeah for sure for sure i mean i think being a bookseller is an i don't know what's what's more

782
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:56,020
interesting if i were you and if you love books and you love making books i would go work for an

783
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:03,300
agency because agencies control the thing or not control but have influence over and can nurture

784
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,940
that which has value in a in a world of changing media which is creative people are they the bad

785
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,660
boys of like the publishing industry you mean like are we the sha na na the publishing industry yes

786
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:22,260
totally i became aware of bowser from sha na na because of his appearance on a late night

787
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:29,860
uh like time life compilation program and it was so sad because it was some some woman of

788
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:36,420
of indeterminate fame and this guy bowser from sha na na who's basically like selling you his

789
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,260
culture this is the last he was sort of boxing it all up for you and asking you to make an offer

790
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:52,660
before he unhinges his jaw and swallows you whole i don't know how much sha na na is is going to

791
00:55:52,660 --> 00:56:00,180
track with the humans who listen to your program but what i would encourage them not to do is look

792
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:09,860
too deeply into the sha na na bis because they're it's not these guys were you know this is this

793
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:17,540
this is this uh this 50s nostalgia group that formed in 1968 eight years

794
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:26,340
eight years after the thing they formed a nostalgia group but it only oh here we go

795
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:34,340
the only the only reason the only reason it worked is nostalgia was that there had been

796
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:40,500
this profound cultural change in in music and culture and so it truly was as though

797
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,820
the 50s had been you know time warped out of existence 5000 years and they represented a

798
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,700
completely different culture these guys up at columbia university started singing these duop

799
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,940
songs from 15 years before or 10 years before and suddenly they're this oldies act and then

800
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,220
they go to woodstock and then they get a tv show out of it they're all really talented

801
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:09,780
dudes but none of them have they have that that completely it like weird rock and roll

802
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,820
pedigree which is that they're all white guys from massachusetts there's no rmb behind them

803
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:20,340
at all they're dancing and singing in gold lamay and their show is somewhere between

804
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:27,700
you know uh the malt shop and studio 54 there's so much bared chest hair one of the cool guys

805
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:34,180
is like 37 years old and bald it is insane this is like a warm this is like a warm blanket this

806
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,380
description that you're just draping over me on a camping trip the question they're just so many i

807
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:45,140
know i know now did you you shaved right okay then i'll tell you the story of shanana the questions

808
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:51,140
that these they're talented and terrible at the same time they're dancing it is the laziest

809
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,180
choreography that i've ever seen big lenny who plays the saxophone who's from my home commonwealth

810
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:01,700
of massachusetts and is still still alive and still out there blowing sax this guy this guy's

811
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:06,660
got a beautiful tenor voice but should not be on tv not because he doesn't have a good look but

812
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,340
he has no presence whatsoever on tv he's constantly flapping his arms around while he sings like some

813
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:20,820
obese bird it's insane like everything about it and and then they all quit they all quit and became

814
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:27,540
uh doctors and attorneys and professors one of them is a linguistics professor at hofstra university

815
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,780
and uh and they're all they're all professionals now those who who are still with us uh except

816
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:40,020
for bowser who's still out there selling the greece right and then and then jaco donnie and

817
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:47,780
screamin scott the nice thing about his starting in 68 with the 50s uh uh culture for bowser is

818
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,220
that now if you are not aware of their history he just looks like somebody who's aged really really

819
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:58,020
well how is this guy still hanging with this this lifestyle because it was close enough

820
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:02,580
to the 50s it just seems like a really really old guy who looks fantastic

821
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:10,100
appending the word by the way oh i know yeah this is what this is well i've been thinking

822
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:15,940
about all night long you guys everyone you know what you can all go down this hole together

823
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,020
let's go into the next catching up on this john and you are very right about this gentleman i

824
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,860
got distracted from the conversation and i just wanted to say that uh bowser from shana is a

825
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,860
co-founder of a group called senior votes count which is a political action committee for old

826
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,740
people you guys i think the rest of this podcast should just be the the sound of us all just

827
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,660
quietly clicking the internet and then just speaking up when you find an interesting

828
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:46,020
challenge my third of the program usually is uh here's a question for everybody what dishes

829
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,180
would all three of you cook on a cooking competition there's somebody not great with

830
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:55,380
math there four of us now but anyway what dishes would you cook on a cooking competition i'm gonna

831
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:01,300
be quiet for a minute i'm just gonna say scrambled eggs the end go oh that was not gonna be mine was

832
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,420
gonna be you know what i do well that that's what makes it a competition from the frugal gourmet i

833
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:13,620
learned this recipe to make an omelet that has uh uh apples cooked in brandy and then you put those

834
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:19,220
in the omelet that's really good i think i'd probably make that justin you and i need just

835
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,060
you're bringing up the frugal gourmet means you and i need to go sit on a porch somewhere for a

836
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,420
couple of hours and you know about his sad history well i'm gonna say had the the sadness that he

837
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:36,820
brought yeah it was a founder of sha na na and then they forced him out get out of here if you

838
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:41,620
had told me that the frugal gourmet or as my uncle jim used to call him frug

839
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:49,860
had been had had a segment on sha na na in its fourth year of syndication in 1981

840
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:55,060
i would be so i would believe it so hard and i would hate you for the rest of my life when

841
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:00,340
i learned it wasn't true we're making a lot of money on sha na na and we want to spend it on

842
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:06,740
shit i don't know not so fast but justin seriously let's not let's not go down a frugal let's let

843
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:14,900
these guys answer uh probably some sort of pie oh really i i know it's it's it's not a great

844
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:20,500
tactic like a dessert like a dessert pie or a chicken pot pie uh no a dessert pie not a not a

845
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:26,980
quiche um you make a dessert pie probably something with pecans or blueberries inside of it yeah it's

846
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:32,420
like the only thing i can do that i feel confident about do you do you do you bake with uh with

847
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,300
shortening or butter or what no i typically store by the the crust which i know is blasphemous but

848
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,820
by which i you know this is what i'm saying do you know what you get for that at the at the state

849
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:48,340
fair a black ribbon and that means you're going to be killed within 24 hours and then the crops

850
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:55,780
will grow again uh i make things incessantly absurd drawing machines books musical instruments

851
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,100
and furniture to name a few i'm good at the solitary business of realizing these works but

852
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:05,060
my trouble is with the social effort required to sustain my ability to make them i understand

853
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:09,380
that people are most concerned with their own lives and so talking casually about my projects

854
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,260
or worse promoting them makes me feel manipulative or conceited how do you make people aware of what

855
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,940
you're doing without making yourself feel obnoxious so that's from bashful in brooklyn

856
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:24,180
what i mean that's what promoters are for right that's who's the higher man yeah who's bashful

857
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:29,940
in brooklyn first of all you're i i think that here are the things though that i would even though

858
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:35,700
this person is a liar and a fraud i can still address some advice to those of you who are out

859
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,500
there who are making uh choices of what to do with their lives creatively and there is discomfort

860
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,220
that comes and anxiety that comes in being a creative person first of all this this liar and

861
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,900
fraud is correct that most people are concerned with their own lives no one cares about what

862
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,900
you're making and that's the way it should be you make something that draws someone attention that

863
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,980
will happen naturally you have an opportunity to put it out there you do have to put it out there

864
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,580
you don't have to believe me you don't have to be going on twitter saying check out my stuff check

865
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:05,300
out my stuff check out my stuff if it's the work is giving you pleasure then it should give you

866
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:10,260
enough pleasure to to put it up for sale or take a picture of it and put it on tumblr or try to

867
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,340
get it published or whatever you don't have to be an incessant self-promoter you don't have to

868
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,860
sabotage yourself either and then i find you know i find helps with that what have a wife or a friend

869
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:25,780
with you that will do it for you and then you can act embarrassed and bad like well i yeah i do do

870
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:36,980
this thing because that's what friends are for for promoting your shit for you it's a collaborative

871
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,900
thing that's why i made such good friends the flavor flavor all those years ago yeah you need

872
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:47,060
a hype man exactly what the what the fuck have you done for flavor flavor lately no flavor flavor

873
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:52,260
is helping his brand wait does flavor flavor have his own hype man is it like an unending chain of

874
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:57,700
hype he has an entire hype man yes i think you put your finger on it exactly that's what the

875
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:04,500
internet is it ends with me um because i'm i just can't i just can't get anybody going

876
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:13,300
i got one more question in the tv's the cosby show uh which huxval child is the best in terms

877
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:19,620
of plot lines memorable sayings and overall attitude that's from bill leaver in baton rouge

878
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:29,380
really touching on your your your key practices your your strengths in the cosby verse well i i

879
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:36,100
actually been catching up on a lot of the cosby show on uh on the video on demand function of

880
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:41,220
my cable box because they're funny you know what guys those were shows were well written

881
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:50,740
well written funny charming shows that my children love they find it incredibly accessible and they

882
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:56,740
don't they don't they don't know anything about pattern matching from the 80s sure they don't

883
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:02,820
know and now this internet stranger is trying to turn it into a cosby child blood sport

884
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,980
right where they they fight for dominance that is not how mr cosby ran the set sir

885
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:11,380
everyone there was held to high expectations but they were a family

886
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:17,860
just ask malcolm jamal warner who will not stop talking about it that guy but one of the things

887
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:26,260
when i was a kid i loved peter the caucasian obese neighbor because that was my entry point

888
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:33,140
to the show it was your way in and i obviously i i was in love with and part of me still is

889
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:39,540
in love with lisa bonet sandra sure thank you so sandra is actually my favorite because uh she is

890
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:45,220
the she is the schrodinger's huxtable in that i i don't know if you guys know this in the pilot

891
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:51,940
episode of the show they do not acknowledge or accept her existence right as an extant human

892
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:58,820
being they say i think uh what either claire or cliff says don't be coy you know exactly who says

893
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:04,900
it uh claire says uh something along the lines of she says something along the lines of having four

894
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:12,980
children right addressing i'm i'm assuming denise and theo and rudy and vanessa while not acknowledging

895
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:18,260
sandra's existence so she doesn't come in until halfway through season one and then she's only

896
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:23,380
in like a few episodes well not a few are you suggesting that she's uh that she's a hallucination

897
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:30,740
i'm assuming that she exists in in in both quantum states at the same time at that moment she she

898
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,900
did not exist or maybe that was just like a really harsh i'm gonna look up the quote because maybe

899
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:40,420
they were just burning rudy can we address that this exact strategy was applied to miss judy

900
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:47,860
winslow after the fifth season of family matters anybody they judy winslow the the young daughter

901
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:55,620
disappeared like it is it is beyond creepy there are this season their daughter was erased never

902
01:06:55,620 --> 01:07:00,580
to be mentioned again from the from the stream from the time stream uh okay what about what about

903
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:05,700
richie's older brother on happy days i think what we're saying everyone's siblings on every episode

904
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:11,140
of boy meets world where suddenly someone will have a sister for the purpose of an episode so

905
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:17,460
someone is disappearing and reappearing the siblings of culture everyone there's a there's

906
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:23,700
no one should be more concerned about it than you guys a sitcom baba yaga is is luring these

907
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:30,500
children into the woods the exact line from the cosby show in the pilot episode which does not

908
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:38,180
acknowledge uh sandra uh it's sandra theistic uh claire says why do we have four children

909
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:43,620
cliff says because we did not want five so it is entirely possible that they are saying rudy you

910
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:51,860
were uh a mistake uh you bring a lot of heat to this show but um uh boy howdy we we really should

911
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:57,220
have stopped with an even quartet i agree i agree that sandra is the most uncanny of the of the

912
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:04,500
cosmos you look at her and you just think like am i looking at a person am i looking at anything

913
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,140
right now it's so hard to tell she goes it makes me really regret that i didn't come on to the show

914
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:17,140
as the as the previously unannounced fourth mackleroy brother sadly you're still john hodgeman
