1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,680
Life is like a hurricane. Hold on, let me just do it. Life is like a hurricane. Okay.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,560
Life is like a hurricane. They're back, folks. Welcome back to Duckburg. We are here to

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,240
commemorate a huge event over the weekend. DuckTales are back in a huge way, and we,

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,160
the whole gang, us. DuckTales am here. Yeah, we are today. Today, look around you. Today,

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,840
we are all DuckTales. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, a sort of DuckTales. I'm

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,080
gonna rename it, Justin. Okay. My Huey, my Dewey, and my Louie. Yeah, my name is-

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,280
How about, can I show, can I do? Yeah. Yeah, please. Please go ahead.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
Quackin' Up with the McElroy Brothers. Oh, that's pretty good.

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
Stop. Quackin' Up with the McElroy Brothers calling DuckTales fanzine.

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,800
This is our DuckTales fanzine. My name is Justin Huey McElroy. I'm Travis

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Webigale McElroy. I'm Griffin Gooey. This is a night record we should mention. We don't typically

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
do these, but if it feels like the atmosphere is a little bit more loosey-goosey, then that's why,

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
although that doesn't make sense, because I just ate a bunch of cheese pizza and like a half a

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,200
pint of ice cream, and so we have about t-minus 60 minutes before I experienced complete butt death.

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,280
On DuckTales, are there any geese?

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,360
Because there's like ducks, right? And then there's beagles.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Yeah, and robots. No, that'd be fucked up, wouldn't it? That would be like a human show

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
with a bunch of humans, and then one human would walk in with a long, long, beautiful,

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
sexy neck into the scene, and that would be kind of like if you're watching Law and Order SVU,

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,600
and then in walks a celebrity. Who's a celebrity nowadays?

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,680
Couldn't summon up any names of celebrities?

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,200
Let me try. Let me try. Chris O'Donnell walks in, but he's got a long, long, long, long neck.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,480
That would be kind of like the one episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,960
which is a half hour of Goofy staring at Pluto and just being like,

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,760
what the fuck? We can all agree this is fucked up, right? Yuck!

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,800
He'll just stare at silence for like three minutes sometimes, and then he'll just be like,

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
no, but seriously, what the fuck? Yeah, it would be like an episode of

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,600
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse if there was a new character introduced who's just a fucking

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,720
filthy rat that would just shit, couldn't speak in the fun way that the other me speak,

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200
but just like shits right on the floor and eats like a dirty sock, and he's just like,

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
because he's a rat and not a mouse. It's fucked up if you think about it.

36
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,080
There is a Mortimer Mouse on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse that is just evil as fuck,

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
and he looks like a dirty rat and never eats his fucking guts.

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,160
So Ducktales is back. Has anyone ever entertained the idea that

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,840
the reason Goofy wears clothes and talks and the reason Pluto doesn't

40
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,160
is because they're just different species of dog?

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,200
It's not some weird fucked up thing. I mean, just some dogs are smarter than other dogs.

42
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
No, that all clocks true. So Ducktales is here.

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
Can we talk about- The series premiered yesterday.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,040
The second episode comes out September 23rd.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
Give me some time to stew.

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
Give me some time to fucking peek and back off. Six weeks, okay. That's fine.

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
If you don't want to bring me to Ducktales climax right away, that's fine.

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,600
Just drop one episode on me for me to just vision board out and print out

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
JPEGs from the episodes. Where's the merch? Where's something?

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,800
You can't give me one episode of Ducktales and be like, it's back. It's really not.

51
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,560
Do you think there are people in message boards and chat rooms like Twin Peaks

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
that are like, what do you think is going to happen with the rest of the season?

53
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,000
In this one scene, Glomgold was wearing red plaid. Do you think that means that it's like blood

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,600
and it's all connected because that guy, I think that that's his brother.

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
Also, by the way, Twin Peaks.

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,360
Hey, that's nothing.

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Are we free to talk about the, I'm sorry, insane thing that happened last year

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
that Travis willed into existence, or is that, do you think, forebidden

59
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
from being spoken about on the podcast?

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
No, that's public knowledge now.

61
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay. Last year, we were talking about how very good it would be to have

62
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,160
our friend Ducktales back in the world because it's a good show and the news about

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Ducktales being rebooted with a star-studded cast, we're like, fuck yeah, we're here for it.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
We won't have to change our password that we use when strangers come to pick us up

65
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,920
at the playground. That's a bim-bam deep cut. Travis said, let's get Lin-Manuel Miranda up

66
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:08,960
in the mix and let's get him his gizmo duck straight up. Travis was not plugged into the

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:17,440
casting process to know that that was the truth. A day later, Lin texted us, who fucking blabbed?

68
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,080
Who blabbering blatherskites?

69
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,720
It's hysterical, by the way, that Lin thinks we know literally anybody else. Anybody on earth

70
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,920
who could have blabbed other than him are Hollywood patient zero, the only person that

71
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,480
we actually know that could do anything.

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Travis was swept up in a months-long grand jury investigation.

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,760
I tried to explain that I'm just a precog. I always have been. I was born a precog and I've

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:02,640
lived a precog life. I tried to explain that to the judge. Eventually, the case was thrown out

75
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:13,440
because I was able to predict the judge's murder and save their wife. But then if the judge wasn't

76
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,600
murdered, then your thing wasn't true. Minority Report 2, it's bad. That was what happened in

77
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:30,800
the appeal. Shit. Hey, Trav, you got any other shots to call? How about the Name of the Wind

78
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,760
series coming out? It's gonna be real good. Yeah, who's in it? Us. Oh. But not as who you'd think.

79
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,760
All three of us play Elladin, stacked on each other's shoulders in a long row. Yeah, they

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,880
haven't done that in a while in a movie or TV show for a while. I think the last time I saw that was

81
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,680
Cloud Atlas and there was Tom Hanks on top of two uncredited actors. Two uncredited Tom Hanks. He

82
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,680
just said, I want to be tall in this one. If I'm going to be in this one, I want to be real,

83
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,120
real tall. So he had two uncredited actors carrying his weight. There's an amazing cast

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,560
in this new reboot of DuckTales. There's David Tennant, Scrooge McDuck, Danny Pudi is

85
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Huey, Ben Schwartz is Dewey, Bobby Moynihan is Louie, Kate McCoochie is Webigale. It's amazing.

86
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,000
It's a huge cast. Beck Bennett is Launchpad, McQuack, are you kidding me? Get out of here.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Star-studded cast. Who's playing Donald Duck? Well, Tony Anselmo. Now I know what you're thinking.

88
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I don't know the name Tony Anselmo. Well, you wouldn't, except for this one thing.

89
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,800
Tony Anselmo is the reigning Donald Duck. And that is the one part where they're like, well,

90
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,760
no, you gotta go to Tony. You gotta get Tony because Tony has been Donald Duck since

91
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,400
1986. Every time you've heard Donald Duck on the original DuckTales. Yeah, that's Tony Anselmo.

92
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,640
Like Tony Anselmo is only Donald Duck. Check his IMDb. It's Buckwild. Only Donald Duck

93
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,840
and always Donald Duck. You can do like a star-studded cast and like we're going to take,

94
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,240
you know, Huey in a different direction and we're going to make Launchpad sound slightly different.

95
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,040
But you couldn't have like Donald Duck as played by Michael Fassbender just like walking around

96
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,760
like, hello, nephews. Come, come with me now. Oh, uncle. Yes, we must fight Glomgold.

97
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
You could have gotten, you could have gotten me though.

98
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh, what a fight. I tried to almost watch that, that, that Lovecraftian deep tongue.

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,360
Yeah, no kidding. Thank you to Tony. Thank you to DuckTales. Can we do the show advice?

100
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah. Would love to get Tony on the show, by the way. So Tony for listening, get at us. Let's do

101
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,720
this. Let's stop dancing around it. There's probably somebody who listens to our show

102
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,480
with like a full blown conspiracy theory that we must just do all sorts of native advertising

103
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,080
on our show. Like there's no way that they just talk about these things for 12 minutes and no one

104
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,880
paid for 12 minutes. There's no way what human being would do a show where they just said

105
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,120
DuckTales for 12 minutes without being paid to do it. We would. We did. We did.

106
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,360
Here's our first question. I need your help. For about a year now, once a month,

107
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,840
someone in my building leaves a banana peel on or around my doorway. At first,

108
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,720
I regarded this as bland bemusement, but then they started deliberately hiding them under my

109
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,640
drawing umbrella or under the doormat, which is a bit sinister. Today, I was horrified to find one

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,800
hanging on my door handle. I had to touch the gross banana mess with my real human fingers.

111
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Any advice on how to get this to stop or failing that advice on how to ferret out the culprit

112
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,720
would be appreciated. And that's from Kip.

113
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Um, is it possible that this is the symbol that lets God's angels of vengeance know to pass over

114
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,680
your house, saving, saving you on this- Trying to save you, Kip.

115
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
Trying to save you on this high holy day. Maybe, maybe it's possible.

116
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:20,000
Is it possible that in a similar vein, this is some sort of like local secret, like secret society,

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,560
and they really want you to join and they don't understand. They keep leaving. They're calling

118
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
card to let you know that they're calling you up. And yet you keep not showing up to their monthly

119
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
meetings. Of the Nanner team.

120
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Of the Nanner team. That is their name. It's not very scary.

121
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,480
But they do a lot of good. They do good. They're very much like Shriners in that way.

122
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,000
So secretive, just like Shriners. What's even going on in those tiny cars?

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,520
They run everything the Nanner team does, and I'm glad we can finally discuss them

124
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,600
openly in the podcast. Well, I mean, we'll have to shut the show down after this. I mean,

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
we'll have to shut the show down after this. I mean, we can't invoke the Nanner team name

126
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,760
and then just continue making jokes like silly boys. Maybe Banana Man lives in your building

127
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,840
and he comes home drunk. He's like, I'm going to take a shit right here.

128
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,600
And then he does shit. It's his shit. And he always shits right there on your door.

129
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
Hold on. OK, so you mean Banana Man, the cartoon within Danger Mouse,

130
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,120
if I remember correctly, and in your mind, canonically, he shits banana peels?

131
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,800
He doesn't even shit whole bananas. That's what's fucked up to me is he shits out

132
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,800
the used husk of a banana. Well, I don't want to. I mean,

133
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
I don't want to play this game with you, but he only eats bananas.

134
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,720
So what do you want him to shit? You know, some whole like Griffin.

135
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,800
So we please don't invoke that that curse back upon my brand. So we got so far list of such.

136
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's get let's this is going to be helpful. Let's do a list of suspects.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
We've got somebody from Nanner team. We've got somebody protecting you

138
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,640
from God's angel of righteous vengeance. We have but we do have Banana Man.

139
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm going to go ahead and put Donkey Kong on the list.

140
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,360
He's either cruising cruising by and he either finishes his snack ever because he's very he's

141
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,920
a very deliberate young ape and he finishes his banana snack on his way to his apartment.

142
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,480
And do you even know your fucking neighbors? Do you even know that you live next door to

143
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
fucking Donkey Kong? OK, whatever. And he just always finishes the banana there.

144
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,320
And that's where he drops it. Alternatively, there's a Mario Kart race that goes on by.

145
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,240
So they just toss it there trying to trip up Toad or Yoshi or whoever.

146
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,600
Griffin, if you live in the same apartment building as Donkey Kong,

147
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
you would know because every time he tried to walk up the stairs,

148
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
you'd have to jump over those barrels. That is a good point.

149
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,960
Video game. Justin, you have a video game joke?

150
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,040
Uh, I don't actually. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Wow. Huh?

151
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah. Huh? So Donkey Kong is definitely on the list.

152
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,720
It could just be a mean child. There's a lot of those.

153
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,280
A mean? But here's the thing, Griffin. A mean but deliberate child. Like,

154
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,960
I would understand if the banana peel just showed up, like, on your doormat.

155
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,960
But under your doormat? Like, this might be someone in the building who now thinks it's

156
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,680
a funny inside joke they have with you, except they forgot to let you inside.

157
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,040
Uh, Kip, I have a question. Have you ever seen Memento?

158
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
It's a great movie. It's good. It's really good.

159
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,040
So I watched Children of Men yesterday. That's another good movie. Travis,

160
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,720
have you seen a good movie lately? Um, let's see. What have I watched lately?

161
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm saying Kip's eating the bananas. I liked Moon.

162
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,840
Moon is underappreciated. Oh, it's a good one.

163
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah. I'm saying Kip's eating the bananas

164
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
is what I'm saying. And forgets about it.

165
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Kip is eating the banana, and it's a very- and it's not like-

166
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,360
Okay, this is gonna sound wild until I put it to you like this.

167
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,280
Tell me the exact moment that you last ate a banana.

168
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
Me? Exactly. Thank you.

169
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm asking both of you. Tell me the exact last moment that you ate a banana.

170
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,200
On purpose or accidentally? Both.

171
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,400
It was- it was that fateful- it was that fateful viral video.

172
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay, well Griffin had a viral hit the last time he ate a banana,

173
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
so he probably- I have- I have lots of evidence.

174
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,720
I will admit, since having a baby, I mindlessly eat bananas sometimes,

175
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,200
because like, we'll give her half a banana, and while I just stand there and stare at her,

176
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,080
mush it into her face like a monster, I will realize I'm eating the other half,

177
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,520
almost like simpatico, like I can't help it. Like, we must both destroy bananas in this moment.

178
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,160
Okay. Okay.

179
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,760
This is what I'm saying, Kip. You need to look- take a long look in that deep,

180
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,960
dark, truthful mirror and say, hey, did- did I eat the banana?

181
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Am I doing this to myself? Is this a Kip joint that I created for myself?

182
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
Am I the Nanner monster?

183
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
Am I the Nanner monster? It's possible. Those are all very-

184
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
Am I the founder of Nanner team?

185
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
Get a fucking Nest Cam or something and get to the bottom of this,

186
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,960
because I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight. Thank you, Kip.

187
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
How about a Yahoo? Yeah, absolutely.

188
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,640
Man, I got some fucking wild ones, y'all. Um, I'm gonna read this one.

189
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,320
I don't know if it'll be a good conversation point, but I was so intrigued by it,

190
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,000
and it was sent in by Chris, uh, Haug. Thank you, Chris.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,880
It's Yahoo Answers user Mike Will, and this is a Yahoo Answers Now, so time is of the essence.

192
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
Mike Will asks, in singles and dating,

193
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,800
how I got the blank ATM card that changed my life.

194
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,840
There's not a question mark on this. I guess they're a little bit more loosey-goosey with

195
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,280
punctuation in Yahoo Answers Now. Um, it's a period at the end of this one,

196
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,160
and if you're waiting for more, you're gonna be disappointed, because there isn't any more.

197
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,920
This seems like, uh, maybe a prompt for, like, a short story and a creative writing class,

198
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,640
but how I got the blank ATM card that changed my life?

199
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:52,560
Um, I think I would posit that what this headline is trying to make us think is, like, an ATM card

200
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,400
that is, like, somehow fully loaded, but without any restrictions, but in fact,

201
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,080
wouldn't a blank ATM card just be... It wouldn't work.

202
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah, it would just be a, like, rectangle of plastic, right?

203
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,280
You'd get on Amazon, and you'd say, like, I'm gonna buy myself a nice foot bath,

204
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,920
and then they send you a card, and you're like, okay, I'm gonna buy myself a foot bath.

205
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,320
And then they say, what's the... Mike, Will, whichever.

206
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,520
I need the information on the card, please, to complete the transaction.

207
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,240
It's me, Jeff Bezos. I think I'm the Amazon guy.

208
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,840
And you can't provide the information, because it doesn't exist as a blank ATM card.

209
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,920
It did change his life, though.

210
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,280
That would be a fucking power move, though. If you walked into a store, and they're like,

211
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,840
that'll be 56.30, and you just handed them a rectangle of blank plastic,

212
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
and just, like, stared at them as they tried to, like, insert it into the chip machine,

213
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,560
or swipe it, and you just kept looking, and they're like, it's not working.

214
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,440
Just, like, gnawed at them. Like, never address anything until they're like, just leave.

215
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,720
Please just take your stuff and get out.

216
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
And then, who's that? It's your husband. That's how I met my husband.

217
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,040
My blank ATM card changed my fucking life.

218
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,080
Changed everything.

219
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
Let's do a different one, because this is dumb.

220
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:06,880
All right.

221
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
This one was sent in by six different people, but Madeline Diaz was the first one.

222
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
Thank you, Madeline. It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, so it's also Mike Will.

223
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Says, my cat saw me throw away a mouse.

224
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
My cat brought me a mouse, and it saw me pick it up and throw it outside.

225
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Will my cat know that I trashed it?

226
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,360
Okay, wait.

227
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,560
Is the concern of this question, like, my cat knows that there's a mouse in the garbage,

228
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,920
or is the concern of this question, my cat gave it to me,

229
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,880
and, like, as a present, and saw me throw it away?

230
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
This cat is not going to be offended.

231
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,240
Kitties are so funny, because they're always bringing you little gifts,

232
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
and you never really want the gifts.

233
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,200
I just love these, I just love these little guys.

234
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Cats are like, cats are like the extended family that found out,

235
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,320
like, you were into something, because they saw you have it, like, once,

236
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
and then, like, you're always getting Minions toys.

237
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,680
Your cat, your cat saw you eat one mouse, and was like, oh, I got you, me too, me too, me too.

238
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,840
Oh, man, oh, I had a mouse, then he took the mouse away from me.

239
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,200
He must want mice.

240
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,600
I got this.

241
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,480
Yeah, he must love them.

242
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
The question asker says they threw it in the trash,

243
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
and then later in the question, they threw it outside.

244
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
I do not know the cat on Earth that if you were like,

245
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
anyways, I'm just going to chuck this mouse outside,

246
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
that cat would not be like, oh, dunk, free mouse.

247
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,280
Like, there's no way that cat's not going to make a run for it.

248
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,080
Um, user J-O-E says, oh, Joe, oops, says.

249
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,040
He's been inside too long, pull him out.

250
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,480
Says, Kitty says, I will never understand humans,

251
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,800
they throw out good food, such a waste.

252
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,520
I don't think Kitty, I love these little guys, like I said,

253
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,720
they're always up to fun and games that, like, I don't really understand,

254
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,600
but I don't think they necessarily understand value,

255
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,160
or, like, would make any sort of evaluations of my human, like, motivations.

256
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
If your cat thought it was weird when you threw the mouse in the trash,

257
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,600
how would your cat react if you just methodically started skinning the mouse,

258
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,320
and then rubbing it in butter and garlic, and then sauteing the mouse,

259
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,240
and then sitting down, and getting your deboning knife,

260
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
and deboning the mouse, and then sitting down, and just enjoying the mouse.

261
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
Would that be more strange for your cat to process?

262
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,880
It seems like that would be also very troubling for the cat.

263
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,280
I always find it funny when people talk about, like,

264
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,800
oh, it must be so weird, like, my cat watches me clean his litter box,

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
like, what does it think I do?

266
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,160
Your cat doesn't care.

267
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,640
Your cat doesn't think about you in that way.

268
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
Your cat doesn't give two shit.

269
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
And this isn't a cat versus dog thing,

270
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
because my dog also doesn't think about the things I do

271
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
three seconds after I'm done doing them.

272
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,120
I love these pets.

273
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Can we stop the podcast for, like, a minute,

274
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,400
so I can go find my kitty and give him a big kiss on his head?

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
But do you guys remember when I had the lizards?

276
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
You had lizards?

277
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,560
You don't remember that brief period where I had the aquarium

278
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,880
up in my attic room with the two, like, red lizards in there?

279
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
You don't remember that?

280
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,440
I don't remember you had lizards.

281
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
Somebody gave me a box with some lizards in it

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
when I was in elementary school or middle school.

283
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
I didn't have them very long.

284
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,680
I wasn't very responsible.

285
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,800
They were already pretty old when they were given to me, folks.

286
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,680
Don't worry at home.

287
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Um, but I remember thinking, this may be the best tra-

288
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
like, the best trade-off of pet-to-owner interaction level

289
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,000
of, like, even better than fish.

290
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,880
The low level, I must commit to enjoy these lizards

291
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
being in this glass box.

292
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
I gotta know more about this person that gave you a box

293
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,120
and said, here's two very old lizards.

294
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
Will you help them die, Travis?

295
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,360
Will you help these old lizards find their way to Jesus?

296
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,360
I wish I could remember more salient details

297
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,040
about this lizard exchange.

298
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,960
But honest to God, the only thing I can remember

299
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
is coming home one day from, like, some kind of practice

300
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
and mom and dad being like, hey, sorry, your lizards are dead.

301
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
And I walked into my room where they were in the aquarium

302
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
and I poked them and they started running around

303
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
and I looked at mom and dad and they were like,

304
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
I swear they were dead, like, 10 minutes ago.

305
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,160
Welcome to-

306
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,760
Thank you for calling Travis McElroy's lizard hospice.

307
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,680
We do have where we try to provide the most calming

308
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,480
sort of spiritual experience for your lizards, too.

309
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Feel free to let go.

310
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
That's the main thing we try to achieve here.

311
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
If you guys are gonna have a bird pet,

312
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
what kind of bird pet would you have?

313
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
Big bird, little bird?

314
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,360
Which one would you go?

315
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Justin says no way.

316
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,360
No way, birds fuck me up, man.

317
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,480
Not even like a hawk, Justin, but your falcon?

318
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,400
Birds are the mice of the sky.

319
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
No way on earth would I ever have a bird pet.

320
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,200
That's beautiful.

321
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,560
What if it, okay, what if it got out and I had to move?

322
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
Cause no way, no way.

323
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
So you mean got out within your home?

325
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
Got out in the house and it'd be like, hi, century 21.

326
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
It did happen again.

327
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
Is this Jake with State Farm?

328
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,760
I need to move.

329
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
I know State Farm doesn't sell houses,

330
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
but I didn't know who else to call.

331
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm so scared.

332
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
Hi, is this J-A-K-E with State Farm?

333
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Oh wait, sorry, it's Jake.

334
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
Is this Jake with State Farm?

335
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Go eat ass.

336
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,080
I would want to do a heavenly dove.

337
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,240
I want a hawk.

338
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,960
I just always pictured myself something of a 15th century lord.

339
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
That's so much work.

340
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,400
I know that's how you envision yourself.

341
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
I want a beautiful dove.

342
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
One that's completely quiet all the time though.

343
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
I'd just like to have my own wings.

344
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,040
Does that count?

345
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,360
I kind of put my wings on my kitty.

346
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,800
That's the best of both pets.

347
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh man, if Buttercup could fly.

348
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
Oh, that'd be amazing.

349
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,680
If I have a flying dog.

350
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,960
Not a good podcast.

351
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,040
It's nine o'clock p.m. on a Sunday night.

352
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,840
What do you want from us?

353
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,680
Family Guy's on and I know I'm missing it.

354
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
Jesus.

355
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
How about the question?

356
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,960
That's what I want from you.

357
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,680
What do you guys think Stoodie Griffin?

358
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,840
What do you guys think Stoodie Griffiths is doing right now?

359
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,560
I bet he's probably messing with his dog.

360
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,920
His dog friend, Briggan.

361
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
And they have a good old time.

362
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,480
I bet whatever he's doing, it is not like congruous with what his age would suggest.

363
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
Yeah, love that.

364
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
I'm gonna read this fucking question if you don't.

365
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
I was driving home from work yesterday and I stopped behind-

366
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,280
One night with my lab, I did see quite a fright.

367
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,080
I don't know the words.

368
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,000
That's it?

369
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,880
Nothing more topical than a Monster Mash reference in August.

370
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,840
That's not even the way the song starts.

371
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,480
You just decided-

372
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,760
I was driving home from work late one night.

373
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
My boss is a real jerk and kept me late.

374
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,280
What a dick.

375
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
Anyway, Mash.

376
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,560
I had to quit.

377
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,320
I had to quit my job.

378
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,200
I hate my job.

379
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,720
If all Griffin needs is two words to start his Yankovic machine up.

380
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
Two words and a gerund.

381
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,760
He needs two words and a gerund to start the Yankovic proclamation.

382
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm not sure that I want to-

383
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay.

384
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,720
I was driving home from work yesterday and I stopped behind a van at a red light.

385
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,720
The van had a rear-facing seat occupied by two teens.

386
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,840
We made eye contact.

387
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
That's your first mistake.

388
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
I spent the rest of the red light looking at the floor.

389
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,560
How should I handle this situation if I get stuck behind them in traffic again?

390
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,120
And that's from-

391
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,680
Oh God, please stop looking at me in Orlando.

392
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,680
Man, holy shit.

393
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,840
So like we had a station wagon growing up that had rear-facing seats and there were,

394
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
you know, a grip of us.

395
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,560
And so like almost always one of us would be back there having to,

396
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,840
um, you know, have eye contact with people behind us.

397
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,960
So like, first of all, think about the fact that this is the only time this happened to

398
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,200
you all night and to them it was, it was Tuesday.

399
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,160
Like this was, this is their, this is their fucking life.

400
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,280
And so like I cannot imagine-

401
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,520
When you had eye contact with M. Bison, it was the worst day of your life.

402
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,480
Like it's, this is, this is, first of all, is this, how is this fucking allowed?

403
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,160
Like since having a child and having to put like a car safety suit on,

404
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,960
a safety seat in the car,

405
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,880
I feel like I'm way more aware of like automotive safety standards.

406
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
How is it cool for folks to just be like,

407
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,000
we're going to face the opposite way as everybody in the car.

408
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,960
Are we good?

409
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
I don't think you're good back there a little bit, maybe.

410
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,680
Not just from a safety standard though, Griffin,

411
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,560
it also sends a signal to whoever is in those seats like,

412
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,040
and you're not a part of the rest of the car.

413
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
Enjoy looking out the back.

414
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,600
We'll be up here talking.

415
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
It does preclude the need for a baby on board sticker.

416
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Cause it's like, look, they're right there.

417
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,840
Look, there's babies.

418
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
Make your, make whatever driving decisions you want.

419
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,960
But as you can see, I have my teens in the car.

420
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
Please try to be responsible.

421
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
Drive like your teens are in my car.

422
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,520
I think the best thing-

423
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
Trying to run me off the road like Liam Neeson.

424
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
I think the best thing you could have done is reached down

425
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
and retrieved your fidget spinner and then spun it up real good for them

426
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,240
to show them that like you mean them no harm and you're,

427
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,160
you know, you're safe and with it.

428
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Roll down some windows and blast LMFAO.

429
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
Is that still a thing?

430
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Absolutely.

431
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
It's still a thing, Travis.

432
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm so glad you've said that.

433
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
We knew this was going to happen,

434
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,480
but we made an episode of our TV show,

435
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
our short-lived television program,

436
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,800
which has a new home, by the way, vrv.co forward slash nbmbam.

437
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,160
Go watch the whole thing for free.

438
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
We'll talk more about it at the end,

439
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,320
but we made an episode about it and we knew this would happen,

440
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
but it's about teens and connecting with teens.

441
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,360
And we focused heavily on dabbing and fidgets

442
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,120
and water bottle flips.

443
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
We missed fidget spinners by like a day.

444
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,840
Yeah.

445
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
And the absence of fidget spinners from that episode

446
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,680
has just hope like it insta-dated it.

447
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,640
It like is already hopelessly out of date

448
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
because fidget spinners were not present in the episode.

449
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,680
It's like by the time it came to air,

450
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,160
it was already hopelessly free of fidget spinners.

451
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,800
I wish there was a thing you could do in the car

452
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,680
that didn't involve paying attention to anything outside of the car

453
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,720
that was like even remotely safe or acceptable.

454
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
Like, you know what I mean?

455
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
Like if there was like a little-

456
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,160
Like a partition.

457
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
Right, but at the front,

458
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,400
a partition that popped up on the hood

459
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,720
that prevented like, you know what I mean?

460
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
But then it's unsafe and you can't see when the light changes.

461
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,800
Anytime I am stopped at a stoplight next to somebody else,

462
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,800
especially if they have like a flashy car

463
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,680
or like a loud car or they look young,

464
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm always really afraid of sending any signals to them.

465
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,080
This is true.

466
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,400
It's gonna sound like a joke, but I'm just gonna say it anyway.

467
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,120
I'm always afraid of sending any signals to them

468
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
that I want to race them.

469
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm always worried that I want to do the wrong thing

470
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
and they're gonna think that I'm trying to race them.

471
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,840
Or I'm saying that my Honda Pilot is faster than their car in any way.

472
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
And I'm just always really paranoid

473
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
about making it clear that I don't want to race them.

474
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,600
Have you, has your foot ever slipped

475
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,680
and you've accidentally like tapped the accelerator

476
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
while you're also holding the brake and you're like,

477
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,960
oh, oh God, no, no, no, no.

478
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
And I have to take my hands off the wheel

479
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,040
and be like, no, no, no, no racing, no racing, please.

480
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,720
I feel like I used to get that in Huntington

481
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,800
when like, you know, fucking high school,

482
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,720
especially driving home from high school,

483
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,400
the high school that Travis and I and Justin

484
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
for I guess three of the years attended

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,840
was like up on this big hill

486
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,280
and you had to like get out on the highway

487
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,080
and drive up to it.

488
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
And so like everybody just fucking drove.

489
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,040
I feel like driving home from that especially,

490
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,560
like every other day,

491
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,320
some motherfucker in like a big Ford truck

492
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,800
would like try to race us.

493
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
And I didn't know how to tell them like,

494
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,920
no, I don't, but then they still race you.

495
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,760
And I, even though I didn't want to participate,

496
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,560
I still take the psychic damage from knowing I lost.

497
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,800
It's a lose-lose situation.

498
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,680
Do you, do you ever when you're driving

499
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,920
like just designate in your mind,

500
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,440
especially when you're on a long car trip,

501
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,680
like that car and I are somehow cosmically connected now

502
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,160
where like, you just see like another,

503
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,200
like you and red car are just like

504
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
kind of maintaining the same speed

505
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,040
and going the same direction for a hundred miles.

506
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,320
On a road trip, like you and, you know,

507
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,520
some, you know, Beatle just keep passing each other

508
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,880
for like eight hours.

509
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,760
And it's like, oh, nice.

510
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
And then you stop at a Denny's

511
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
and then you leave the Denny's

512
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
and like an hour later you see him again.

513
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
It's like, oh, you stopped too, yes.

514
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Nice. I saw today

515
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
when I was driving back from Huntington,

516
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
two motorcyclists, motorcyclers?

517
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,360
Cyclerinos.

518
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
And they were- Gearheads.

519
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
Gearhead, two gearheads.

520
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,560
And they were on bikes, like one car ahead of me

521
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,000
and like together for easily 25 miles.

522
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
And then suddenly at an intersection,

523
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,440
one of them turned and the other one kept going

524
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
for a long time.

525
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
And I got a divorce just there on the road.

526
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,280
Suddenly I was incapable of accepting

527
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,000
that they had not been together that whole time.

528
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,960
Like that they were just two independent gearheads

529
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,320
that are just like, let's ride together for a while.

530
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
And like, I was truly blown away and touched

531
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,560
by that moment of like, I don't know you

532
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
and you don't know me,

533
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,840
but we're gearheads for life now.

534
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,720
Let's go.

535
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
I can't wait till self-driving cars like fix all this

536
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,160
because I will not have to even look up from my Mad Magazine

537
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
that I'm just sitting in the cockpit

538
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,080
of my fucking GoPod that Elon just made for me.

539
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,400
It's a custom Elon original GoPod.

540
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,480
And just like, you're in your GoPod facing backwards

541
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,600
like an asshole.

542
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,480
You know, fidget spinning two or three spinners

543
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
at the same time, like showing off that.

544
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
And I'm just like, nice try.

545
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
And meanwhile, I'm trying to solve all the puzzles

546
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,360
and all the Mad Magazine, get all the jokes

547
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,880
in the Mad Magazine.

548
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,160
Trying to fold that back page.

549
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,600
Do the fold one, yeah.

550
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,320
I love that.

551
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,360
All right, we've lost the plot.

552
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,920
Let's go to the money zone.

553
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,560
This week, I want to tell you about an old friend.

554
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,520
Oh, hey old friend.

555
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,480
Come on in, sit on down.

556
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh, it's been a while.

557
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,120
It's been a while since we talked over it.

558
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,600
What's that?

559
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,120
You brought snacks?

560
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
Your nature box?

561
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,280
Snacks, well, that was a weird intro to this ad.

562
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
But nature box is sponsoring us this week.

563
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
They have over a hundred snacks and they taste good

564
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,680
and are actually better for you.

565
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
All snacks are made for-

566
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
Everybody, if you listen back to that part,

567
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,560
if you're re-listening, when you get to that section,

568
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,680
I want you to imagine Travis like hanging by a noose

569
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,320
and Griffin and me just staring up at him like,

570
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,080
nope, let him dangle.

571
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,760
We're absolutely not gonna jump into this weird intro trap

572
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,280
that he has laid for himself.

573
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,240
Absolutely not.

574
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm not worried.

575
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
I'm like fucking looping.

576
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
I'm gonna get out of whatever trap you laid for me.

577
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm a bit of a joke wizard like that.

578
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,640
No bad joke can hold me.

579
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,040
All snacks are made from high quality, simple ingredients,

580
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,600
which means no artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.

581
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,280
So you can feel good about what you're eating.

582
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
I myself, I love a nice salty snack.

583
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
Love the Asiago cheese crisps.

584
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,680
I like the sesame sticks, that kind of thing.

585
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,120
Way deep into that.

586
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,320
But they also have like whole wheat chocolate.

587
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
I like a big island pineapple.

588
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,400
It's just a big pineapple ring that's all dried out

589
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
and I can look through it and pretend

590
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,920
that it's like a little portal to another world.

591
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,000
Justin, what do you like?

592
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
The chewing gum that they have.

593
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,440
Have you guys tried that yet?

594
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,040
Is that real?

595
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
No, but I was trying to get it going.

596
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,400
If they wanted to have some nature box chewing gum,

597
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
I bet it would be great

598
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
and it'd have lots of real fruit flavor.

599
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,840
And I would love that sort of natural approach.

600
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Yeah, I love their hypothetical gum too.

601
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,440
That's my favorite.

602
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,120
Chav, what is your other stuff they don't have,

603
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
but that they would crush?

604
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
I really liked their nature box donuts

605
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,760
that are just filled with vegetables,

606
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,120
but it doesn't taste like it.

607
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,320
I got my home insurance through nature box.

608
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
And there's no artificial sweeteners in there.

609
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,920
But then my kitchen exploded and they got me.

610
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
They didn't give me money.

611
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,480
They just sent me a bunch of snacks.

612
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,680
And I was like, nature box, this is actually bad insurance.

613
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,000
I need a new home nature box.

614
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,040
This would all happen in the hypothetical.

615
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,920
And right now you'll say-

616
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,960
This is the world that I see.

617
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
This is the world I see when I peer through my pineapple rings.

618
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,760
Nature box is offering my brother,

619
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,920

Come chow down on these delicious

627
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,480
preservative free stargates.

628
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
Everybody step back.

629
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
I'm about to talk about me undies.

630
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,600
You want to look good in your underwear

631
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,640
and be comfortable.

632
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,040
The balance is hard to find.

633
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
In fact, it's razor thin.

634
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
It's shaped like a me undies logo

635
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
because they're the only underwear that are both.

636
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,080
August is national underwear month

637
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,720
and celebrate me undies is making it easier than ever

638
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
to try the world's most comfortable underwear

639
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
by giving you a risk free guarantee.

640
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
All national underwear month long,

641
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
which is the only thing we're allowed to call it now.

642
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,400
No more August.

643
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,120
August is dead.

644
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,600
If you don't love your me undies, they're free.

645
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
Me undies are made from linsing micro modal,

646
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
a sustainably sourced naturally soft fabric

647
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
that's proven to be three times softer than cotton.

648
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,840
Listen, there's other stuff we could talk about

649
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,520
with me undies, but just please just try them

650
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,800
and tell me that you don't think that it is life-changing

651
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,600
comfort and pleasure there down there

652
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,960
because you will not regret it.

653
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
You're not going to need to,

654
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
I don't care about this guarantee they have.

655
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,080
It's a lie.

656
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,640

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,360
Hey, I want to tell you about Drunks and Dragons.

669
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,280
It's a podcast on iTunes.

672
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
It's an actual play, fifth edition D&D campaign

673
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,440
that is filled with unlikely but lovable heroes.

674
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,240
With an expansive back catalog, Drunks and Dragons

675
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
follows a group of friends as they try to save the world

676
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,160
without destroying it in the process.

677
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,520
Even though there's a large backlog,

678
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,640
you can jump in any time.

679
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,080
And we even have an abridged version

680
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,680
to help listeners get caught up quick.

681
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,200
Adventure Zone, the first campaign is ending this week.

682
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,480

It's all geeklyinc.com for the Drunks and Dragons podcast.

686
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
I got a message for Nick, and it's from Aaron,

687
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,760
and it says, hey, buddy.

688
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,200
I don't know why I made that sound so sardonic.

689
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
What's up, you piece of shit?

691
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,440
Hey, dookie lord.

692
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
Thanks for being the best paleontologist,

693
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
dungeon master, and boyfriend ever.

694
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,280
The brothers and I say, great job, Nick.

695
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,080
Keep up the good work, CRJ.

696
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,440
Also, just a nice Carly Rae Jepsen nod in there

697
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,520
to let Carly know that she's doing a good job.

698
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,320
I love that.

699
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Yeah, I would like it, actually, I would prefer it

700
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
if all our messages from now on would be like,

701
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
hey, Susan, congratulations on graduating.

702
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,280
You're the best friend that I could ever ask for.

703
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
I'll never forget that day we spent

704
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
in the big hot air balloon ride.

705
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,120
And Carly, the album is great.

706
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
Can't wait for the new one to drop.

707
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,360
Cuts the Feeling is the fucking jam of the summer,

708
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,800
and we're all so grateful for it.

709
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,720
And if it is a taste of things to come in your next LP,

710
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,040
I couldn't be more excited.

711
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
Please keep following this exciting direction

712
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,960
for music that is completely redefining the face of pop.

713
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
And also, whoever you were at the beginning,

714
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,360
again, congratulations on graduating.

715
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,760
But really, mostly, Carly, thank you for changing me.

716
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,720
You are just the queen of jumbotrons.

717
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,480
Hey, MaxFun fans.

718
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
It's me, Jesse, the owner of MaxFun.

719
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
I've got a question for you.

720
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,400
Will you help us make our shows better?

721
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
We wanted to find a way to find out

722
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,280
what the MaxFun community thinks about our shows.

723
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,560
So we started something called the MaxFun Listener Panel.

724
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,360
Basically, you subscribe to a podcast feed,

725
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,560
and twice a month or so, roughly speaking,

726
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,480
we'll send you an episode of a show

727
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,280
and instructions on how to fill out a quick survey

728
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
about what you think about that show.

729
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
10 questions, nothing too crazy.

730
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
You'll be hearing existing shows

731
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,360
that we're thinking about making changes to,

732
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,920
secret pilots of shows that we're developing

733
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,360
that you'll only hear this way,

734
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,160
shows we're considering adding to the network,

735
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,560
and what you think about them really matters to us.

736
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
So to join the panel is easy.

737
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,880
Just go to maximumfun.org slash listener panel.

738
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,120
That's maximumfun.org slash listener panel.

739
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,200
Thanks for helping make MaxFun better.

740
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
I have a Yahoo here, and this one is from Seth Carlson.

741
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,040
What do you all think about the delivery man?

742
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, because he's delivering.

743
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,120
I like that because then like one in every thousand times,

744
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,960
he does deliver it to the wrong address,

745
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,440
which I think is still a pretty good hit rate,

746
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
all things considered, for sure.

747
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,320
Hey, everybody, this is Radio Lab.

748
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,440
We got a Yahoo.

749
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
I don't get it.

750
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,840
Anyway, thank you.

751
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,960
I have to read it.

752
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,160
Thank you, Seth.

753
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,160
It's Yahoo Answers user eatbabyseals.

754
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,800
Damn it.

755
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,600
Damn it.

756
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,480
Damn it.

757
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,040
Says, what's your trademark?

758
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,240
What's your trademark?

759
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
What's your trademark?

760
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
What's your trademark?

761
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,160
What's your trademark?

762
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:22,880
No.

763
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,880
What's your trademark?

764
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,040
I thought about this, and it was like,

765
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,920
in high school, there's a kid who did tricks.

766
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,640
He did magic tricks at the table during lunch.

767
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
He would always come around and he would do magic tricks.

768
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,520
And he was also, he was very wealthy also.

769
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,440
And so he had a couple trademarks.

770
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,040
I thought it might be fun to just like,

771
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
oh, that's Griffin.

772
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,680
He's always got a mint.

773
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,160
He's always got a mint, and he's handing them out if you need them.

774
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,600
One time at church camp, different year than the Andy Mack year,

775
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,520
I always had sunglasses on.

776
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,560
And that could have been like my thing.

777
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,800
This is going to sound like I'm making this up

778
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
after talking about Andy Mack,

779
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,960
but I'd wanted people to call me shades,

780
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,720
but I had a youth pastor who was like,

781
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,920
you can't, that'll just happen if it happens.

782
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
Andy Mack, I could sneak in a little bit.

783
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,080
Was it Jim?

784
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,880
Jim Moosey?

785
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,240
No, it was a different.

786
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
It was out of state.

787
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,600
What's your trademark?

788
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,920
His youth pastor in Canada, you wouldn't know him.

789
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,560
That's Griffin.

790
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,000
He's always got sunglasses on.

791
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
He always has a mint.

792
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
And so if you're at a party and you have this,

793
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,240
if you have the hot breath,

794
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,360
just look for the guy with sunglasses

795
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
because that's his trademark and ask him for a mint

796
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,880
because that's his second trademark.

797
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,080
I love that.

798
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,960
I would like to be Travis,

799
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,000
the guy who always knows where the food trucks have stopped.

800
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I don't know how often that would come up,

801
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,640
but like when it did.

802
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,000
And it's gonna be too difficult.

803
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,760
It's gonna be tough for you to track that.

804
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,280
It's an unrealistic trademark.

805
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
I can always have mints.

806
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
I can make sure I've always got mints.

807
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,080
I eat a lot of Tic Tacs in my car,

808
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,040
but they're not the mint flavor.

809
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
I almost always have like either orange

810
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,960
or the assorted fruit flavored Tic Tacs

811
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
and I always have them in one of my cup holders

812
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
so I can have myself a little snack

813
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,000
when I have to go and run a chore.

814
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,960
That's kind of a trademark,

815
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,120
but then nobody gets to experience those with me

816
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,720
because nobody ever gets in my car except for baby

817
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
and he can't have Tic Tacs, he'd just swallow them.

818
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
What's your trademark, Justin and Travis?

819
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,440
I had wanted for a long time for it to be yo-yo.

820
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,080
I wanted to be sort of yo-yo Jay,

821
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,920
the guy who was so good at yo-yo tricks.

822
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,400
And it just, here's the thing about a worthwhile trademark,

823
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,600
like a worthwhile trademark is it really does take,

824
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,440
you gotta put the work in.

825
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
You have to put the effort into getting,

826
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
because another trademark you could have

827
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
is Justin McElroy,

828
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,400
the guy that always publicly fucks up yo-yo tricks.

829
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,560
And that would be a less desirable trademark,

830
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,680
but it would be an effective and I would say pervasive one

831
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,320
that would be pretty pernicious.

832
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,560
It would be tough to shake that one.

833
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,600
My personal trademark,

834
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,640
and I've only just begun implementing this,

835
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,160
is Travis McElroy,

836
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,280
the guy who's a time traveler from the future

837
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
stuck in the past trying to get home.

838
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,960
Yeah, because what's great about it is

839
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,360
unlike Justin's yo-yo fantasies,

840
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,840
it actually takes very little work

841
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,080
because I can say anything about the future

842
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,360
with very little research and no one's gonna be like,

843
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
that's not what it's like in the future.

844
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280
And it also makes me interesting

845
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
because people really wanna know about the future.

846
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,000
And here's the other thing,

847
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,960
and I know what you're thinking,

848
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,720
but Travis, people already know you.

849
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,840
Yes, of course.

850
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,160
That's why my mythos is my consciousness

851
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,760
traveled back from the future

852
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,080
and inhabited my current present day body.

853
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,920
And I can't figure out how to get my Travis McElroy

854
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
consciousness back to the year 2087,

855
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,040
the day I was dying.

856
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
Sounds like a lot of work, that trademark.

857
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,640
I could just have a couple of tens of Altoids

858
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,240
on me at all time and that's a trademark,

859
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,200
but yours requires you to pretend to know things from 2087.

860
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,800
But Griffin, how far are your Altoids gonna take you?

861
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,920
It's like, oh, can I have an Altoid?

862
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,960
You can, end of interesting exchange.

863
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,240
But if I talk about like-

864
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,560
Well, then I show them my other trademarks.

865
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,280
I put on my, well, I don't put on the sunglasses.

866
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,520
I've had them on the entire party.

867
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,280
You're starting to sound like a trademark troll

868
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,600
where you just get really broad trademarks.

869
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,880
Oh, let me keep going.

870
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:27,760
Okay.

871
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
I then ask them if they have any weed.

872
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,040
That's my other trademark.

873
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,880
The problem with having a-

874
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,320
And then I jump really high.

875
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,400
It's another trademark of mine is how high I can jump

876
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,360
and people love it.

877
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,200
One issue with having a,

878
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,160
let's say contextually popular podcast

879
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,160
is that it's so hard to try to establish a trademark

880
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,120
for yourself in high school

881
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,560
when I was really thinking about trademarks a lot.

882
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,040
And now sometimes parts of my life just become trademarks

883
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,680
and I don't necessarily need or want or desire.

884
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Like you talk about beans and then on Twitter,

885
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
to everybody on Twitter, you become Bean Boy.

886
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
And really that's my life I'm living.

887
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,400
I'm living the bean life like day to day

888
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,680
and it's not necessarily something that I want to define

889
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,280
me as a person.

890
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't need an additional trademark on those lines.

891
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,560
Please join me in my banana vore corner

892
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,440
and we can hang out here and have a little party together.

893
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,880
I just didn't mean for that to be my bram.

894
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,760
I guess is what I'm worried about.

895
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,920
Well, we don't get to make this call, my boy.

896
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,360
You talk about beans or sexual swallowing

897
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,840
or you eat a banana funny once and it goes viral.

898
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,360
And then that's who you are to folks.

899
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,800
But I've got fucking layers, man.

900
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,120
I've always got fucking mints on me,

901
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,320
but nobody calls me the mint man.

902
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,280
Nobody ever asked me for a mint.

903
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,200
They always want to talk to me about bananas or vore.

904
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,680
They edited out the part of the banana video

905
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,040
where right after Griffin's like,

906
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,800
anybody got a mint?

907
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,760
Just kidding.

908
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,720
I always have them.

909
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,920
I always have them.

910
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,400
I could be Travis McElroy,

911
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,200
the guy who zones out during recording the podcast

912
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,360
because he's scrolling through Facebook

913
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,760
and gets distracted by pictures of Chris Evans.

914
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,880
What do you think?

915
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,680
I am a cashier at a farmer's market in Michigan.

916
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,440
We sell a huge variety of stuff, including fresh shrimp.

917
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,080
Today, a toddler walked by our shrimp cooler and started-

918
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,080
You have to read it, read it, read it, read it.

919
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,480
I can't.

920
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
That's the problem with reading a few words ahead

921
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,120
is that sometimes I can mess myself up

922
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,320
while I'm trying to read it good.

923
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,600
We sell a huge variety of stuff, including fresh shrimp.

924
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Today, a toddler walked by our shrimp cooler

925
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,600
and started chanting, shrimp, heaven, now.

926
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
Emphasis on the now,

927
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,800
eventually leading his mother to say,

928
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,760
please, please, Daniel, we can't keep doing this.

929
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,120
What is shrimp heaven?

930
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,360
Why does Daniel need it now?

931
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,920
What are my responsibilities in this situation?

932
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,000
If any, I'm confused and delighted

933
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,920
by the slogan eating child.

934
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,880
But I fear something darker may lay under the surface

935
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,840
that's from shrimp Jesus will return.

936
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,200
All right, let's take a-

937
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,280
Shrimp heaven now.

938
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
Let's all take a minute and collect ourselves

939
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and appreciate how good this child is

940
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
and how good this situation is.

941
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,320
All right.

942
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,560
There's just no reality in which,

943
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,760
like, talk about trademarking.

944
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,400
This kid went for a narrow line on it,

945
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
but I do celebrate it.

946
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
That is a great trademark.

947
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,360
Shrimp heaven now.

948
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,440
Okay, I'm back.

949
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,280
I like the idea of like, he's trying to say,

950
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,000
like, let me get all up in shrimp heaven right now.

951
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,120
That's what it's gotta be, right?

952
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,880
This is not a religious child.

953
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,160
I have to imagine.

954
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,520
Here's the thing.

955
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,080
What I would like to believe is that this kid

956
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,000
is just crazy for shrimp.

957
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,200
Just loves those prawny bastards.

958
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,240
Wild for this stuff.

959
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,560
So much so that it has led his parents

960
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,840
to say things like, please, Daniel,

961
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
we can't keep doing this

962
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,080
because this child's shrimp hunger

963
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,320
is driving them out of house and home.

964
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,360
It's an expensive protein.

965
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,360
It's a lot of work to prepare one.

966
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,360
Fresh shrimp, not precooked, not boiled shrimp.

967
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,720
Just fresh shrimp.

968
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,840
And it's all Daniel's.

969
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
And they got those dookie veins in them still

970
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,920
and that takes a while to get those out of there.

971
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,360
No, Daniel loves it all.

972
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,080
They go to remove the mud vein

973
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,240
and Daniel's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

974
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,840
God doesn't make any mistakes.

975
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,440
That's part of the shrimp, Monferric.

976
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,520
Why don't you leave that in there for Daniel?

977
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,960
Let Daniel handle that for you.

978
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,320
Shrimp heaven now.

979
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,160
Do you think this kid burned down a red lobster?

980
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,920
Definitely, definitely.

981
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,440
Or did something in a red lobster

982
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,880
that required it to be burned down?

983
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,760
And now he has to facilitate the shepherding

984
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,520
of these shrimp souls to heaven.

985
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,480
That's possible too.

986
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,360
To free himself from his own burden.

987
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,240
To get the shrimp up to heaven by eating them.

988
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,960
How, if you saw that exchange,

989
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,520
how do you not just leave your job?

990
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,000
How do you not just stand up, walk out,

991
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
and follow these people and be like,

992
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,800
listen, I have to get to the end of this story.

993
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,200
I have to hear the rest of shrimp heaven now.

994
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,240
What is Daniel doing?

995
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,840
I've made six episodes of a television show.

996
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,360
Now on vrv.co, go check it out.

997
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,560
I've made six episodes of television show

998
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,520
and I don't think I'm like,

999
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,480
you know, especially tuned in

1000
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,160
to what Hollywood wants or needs.

1001
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
But I'm pretty sure I could make a television show

1002
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,080
about your child, about shrimp.

1003
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,080
And the name of the show would be called Shrimp Heaven Now.

1004
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,120
And I guess it'd be a shrimp review television.

1005
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,320
We'll figure that out later.

1006
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,280
But we got the title, we got the heat.

1007
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,560
Get Kristen Bell in there.

1008
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,880
And that plus Shrimp Heaven Now equals Emmy success.

1009
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,040
All the Emmys and some Golden Globes to boot.

1010
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,840
We haven't had a My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt

1011
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,800
available on Tipotico for quite a while.

1012
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,680
And I feel like maybe this is the one.

1013
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,600
I feel like this is a new era for this show.

1014
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,400
And I feel like a t-shirt that just says Shrimp Heaven Now

1015
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,160
would be extremely, extremely powerful.

1016
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,440
Do you remember those that?

1017
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
Do you remember the like Peace Loving Crabs t-shirt?

1018
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,440
I think it was Joe's Crab Shack, right?

1019
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,920
What if we just had a shirt that was like a shrimp,

1020
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,760
an angel and a clock?

1021
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,680
And it's like, everyone knows.

1022
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,280
The other way we do it is just the black t-shirt

1023
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,720
with the white words all on the same like paragraph break.

1024
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,520
That's, you know, and it's like shrimp and heaven and now.

1025
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,840
Or we could also do Keep Calm and Shrimp Heaven Now.

1026
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,360
That one's really good also.

1027
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,120
I think we have a lot of opportunity here

1028
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,160
for Shrimp Heaven Now.

1029
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,760
And I think we may have found a trademark

1030
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,840
that I will take from this child.

1031
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,440
We could have one that say Big Dog Shrimp Heaven Now.

1032
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,200
That one's got no fear for Shrimp Heaven Now.

1033
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,280
Hyper color sort of.

1034
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,400
Hyper color shrimp, yeah.

1035
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,160
Maybe a lizard with sunglasses, an old lizard.

1036
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,760
I can't believe how good this is.

1037
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,160
It's renewing my entire faith in humanity.

1038
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,880
Shrimp Heaven Now, but Shrimp Heaven Now by itself

1039
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,080
is very good.

1040
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,640
I mean, we can all agree that Shrimp Heaven Now

1041
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
is excellent and beautiful,

1042
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:02,400
but the fact that we can't keep doing it with Daniel

1043
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,560
is what really brings it over the limit

1044
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,600
because that could have been a one-off.

1045
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,520
You know, kids say the darkest things

1046
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,200
is one thing that I have made up.

1047
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,400
And, you know, he could have just spouted

1048
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,360
whatever came to his head.

1049
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,800
No, this is a recurring theme for Daniel.

1050
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,920
It's Shrimp Heaven Now.

1051
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,200
I think that there's a lesson in that, though.

1052
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,800
I obviously love Shrimp Heaven Now.

1053
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,040
No three words have ever been more perfectly suited

1054
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,920
for each other, but there's a limit.

1055
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,720
There's a limit to it before it could be exhausted,

1056
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,840
as is evidenced by the fact that,

1057
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,760
hey, everybody, Shrimp Heaven Now,

1058
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,560
it's losing something, isn't it?

1059
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,040
I almost feel like, let's call the episode, I feel like,

1060
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,880
because we're going to keep saying Shrimp Heaven Now

1061
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,720
and I don't want to rob it of its power.

1062
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,400
Let's go five or six episodes

1063
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,160
and then really drop a Shrimp Heaven Now in

1064
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,080
and then it'll be like a fun, fun callback.

1065
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,400
To that point, I think we do need to qualify the t-shirt.

1066
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,480
So in big bold letters, Shrimp Heaven Now,

1067
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,840
and then in a smaller subtitle,

1068
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,440
we can't keep doing this,

1069
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,200
but just like acknowledges like,

1070
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,680
we know that this is like,

1071
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,840
this is a brief moment in time of viral t-shirt marketing

1072
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
of shrimp heavy advertising.

1073
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,560
I was thinking it would be the title of this episode, right?

1074
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,280
Shrimp Heaven Now.

1075
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,320
It's a good episode title.

1076
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,440
Please don't tweet at us and each other,

1077
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,560
Shrimp Heaven Now.

1078
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,720
I'm going to do a Twitter search tomorrow

1079
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,960
for Shrimp Heaven Now and any results I get,

1080
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,080
I'm going to be very disappointed.

1081
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,200
We got to protect this.

1082
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,480
We got to protect this.

1083
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,880
Yes, well, I'm tired of us burning through things

1084
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,560
so quickly.

1085
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,600
We have to sort of hoard this resource

1086
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,760
of Shrimp Heaven Now being funny.

1087
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,360
Let's do a slow burn, like I Love Bees kind of slow burn

1088
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,640
and like, you can tweet Shrimp Heaven Win

1089
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,760
with a question mark for like the next two months, right?

1090
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,280
You can tweet that whenever you want.

1091
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Or, here's what I want.

1092
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,120
I want everybody to just tweet either Shrimp or Heaven or Now,

1093
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,840
just one word, but not the whole thing.

1094
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,680
And then people can put it together.

1095
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,960
And you can make it private.

1096
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,760
Like if you want to use ShrimpHeavenNow.com

1097
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,440
to access our podcast,

1098
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,200
you definitely can do that.

1099
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,760
That's an option that's available to you for sure.

1100
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,000
But like, you don't need to go run in your mouth about it.

1101
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,160
But when that t-shirt does become available

1102
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,520
and like, I'm on it, like we're doing it,

1103
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,760
you can get it at that URL.

1104
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,920
So if you're listening to this in the past or the future,

1105
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,920
Travis, what is it?

1106
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,320
Well, Justin, it's hard for me to say

1107
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,720
without giving away too much information

1108
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
that could damage the time stream.

1109
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,560
Okay, that's a really good trademark actually.

1110
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Because there's fear, there's a fear in it.

1111
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,800
I love that.

1112
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,280
That's going to do it for us folks on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1113
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,040
We alluded to this earlier.

1114
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,000
Well, we didn't allude so much

1115
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,840
as give you a fucking URL to visit.

1116
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,600
We said it eight times before.

1117
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,280
Our show got sold by CISO.

1118
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,320
Rest in peace, CISO.

1119
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
Shutting down this year.

1120
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,480
According to reports,

1121
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,000
we don't have any insider information there.

1122
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,960
But the point is,

1123
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,360
our show can now be found at vrv.co forward slash mbmbam.

1124
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,640
Now here's the cool stuff.

1125
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
Now make sure you don't go to vrv.com.

1126
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,840
That's not going to get you anything.

1127
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:19,760
But vrv.co slash mbmbam is going to give you our show for free.

1128
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,520
It's ad supported.

1129
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,880
There'll be ads, but you can just watch the show.

1130
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,160
And not just the show,

1131
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,440
you can watch all the bonus materials.

1132
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,360
There's one that's like one of my favorite things that we shot

1133
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,400
where we're all bugging the mayor about Candle Nights

1134
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,040
that didn't make it to the show.

1135
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,480
Shit, that's a good, yeah.

1136
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
But it's really, I love that.

1137
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,960
I want to point out it's just in America right now.

1138
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,680
The US.

1139
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,760
The places where it was available on iTunes, it's still there.

1140
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,080
But it's not on Verve anywhere else.

1141
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,320
And I hope that that changes.

1142
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
But as we've said so many times before,

1143
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,040
that is not a decision that we make at all.

1144
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,800
In any way, shape, or form.

1145
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,040
Yeah.

1146
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,720
But I also want to say,

1147
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,720
this upcoming JoCo Cruise,

1148
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,680
my wife and I will be there.

1149
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,200
We'll be doing some Shmander stuff.

1150
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,800
And probably classes and appearing on other people's things.

1151
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,640
And there's still a few cabins available.

1152
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,280
So if you'd like to join us, go to JoCoCruise.com

1153
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,000
and check that out.

1154
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,920
And I also do want to say, as Griffin mentioned,

1155
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,920
we will be putting out the ultimate,

1156
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,040
the final episode of the Adventure Zone balance arc.

1157
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,720
Adventure Zone will be continuing.

1158
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,560
Don't get it twisted.

1159
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,640
This is just the ending of this storyline.

1160
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,120
And if you have never listened before,

1161
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,640
it's maybe one of the top five things

1162
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,560
I'm most proud of in my entire life.

1163
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,160
Especially, I would say,

1164
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,320
due in large part to the work that Griffin does.

1165
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,120
He's an amazing DM and writer.

1166
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,360
And so if you've never checked it out,

1167
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,840
you have four days that you could just like-

1168
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,760
Please don't just listen to the finale.

1169
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,600
You will not enjoy it, I don't think at all.

1170
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,920
But start at the beginning, listen straight through.

1171
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,360
And it'll be there even if you're not ready by Thursday.

1172
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,200
That's how podcasts work, Travis.

1173
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,240
It's now informing you how on-demand content functions.

1174
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,640
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1175
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,520
for these four theme songs.

1176
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,360
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1177
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,040
It's a really, really, really good album,

1178
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,640
as are all the Long Winters albums.

1179
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,320
You should go listen to all of them.

1180
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
And speaking of going and listening to things,

1181
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,440
go listen to all the other amazing shows on MaximumFun.org.

1182
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,240
There's a ton on there that fit a bunch of different genres

1183
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,280
and styles and tastes and interests.

1184
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,720
You're going to find something you like,

1185
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,320
but probably a bunch of stuff you like.

1186
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,640
So go check it out, MaximumFun.org.

1187
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,200
Here's a final, sent in by the delivery man,

1188
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,080
Seth Carlson, thank you.

1189
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,680
It's Yahoo Answers user Matt asks.

1190
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,560
And I'm going to read the whole thing

1191
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,160
because the additional details are fucking great.

1192
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,800
Will there be a Zootopia 2?

1193
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,520
In the first film, they only had mammals,

1194
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,400
not birds, reptiles, or bugs, not even tapirs.

1195
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,360
I love tapirs and would love to see one or two in a sequel.

1196
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,760
I admire the tapirs in the Ice Age films.

1197
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,760
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

1198
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1199
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1200
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,240
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1201
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,600
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1202
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:37,280
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

1203
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,960
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

1204
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,200
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

1205
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,400
I'm a dragon man.

1206
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,280
I cast fire on him.

1207
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,160
It's very good.

1208
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,080
I address the red dragon and say,

1209
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,160
us, we're the hosts of The Adventure Zone,

1210
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,360
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1211
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,480
Very good synergy.

1212
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,280
Commit to the bit.

1213
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,880
I roll to charm new listeners.

1214
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,760
It is very effective against all odds.

1215
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,720
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

1216
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,680
We host The Adventure Zone,

1217
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,760
it's a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

1218
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,120
It's a comedy podcast.

1219
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,480
We don't take the rules too seriously

1220
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,520
because there's a lot of them

1221
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,800
and we did not take the time to learn them.

1222
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,520
Maybe listen to us.

1223
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,160
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

1224
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,880
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

1225
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:45,440
I think this promo is a critical hit.
