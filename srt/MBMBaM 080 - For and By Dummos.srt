1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:50,080
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? Hey, welcome, folks. This is my brother,

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,960
my brother and me in an advice show for the Monterey. We're just heating up for the holiday

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,640
season. Are we already on that creep? We are on it. We're going to record our Christmas episode

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,600
now and then you save it. Promise you don't listen to it until then. Now, every episode is going to

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,000
be a Christmas episode. We love getting into the spirit. My argument is if Starbucks has got a red

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,840
cup, I've got the light of Jesus's birth in my heart. That is my one to one. Do not look directly

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
at that birth. That was very bright, but it's like a flash bang. And unfortunately, if Starbucks has

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,880
a white cup, we're empty and soulless inside. Yeah. Who's hollow? Who? I don't know. Tell me,

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,920
Starbucks. Only Starbucks remembers Jesus. Only Starbucks. You can get a CD up at the checkout.

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,360
You want Buble? You want Buble or you want Jeezu? You know, Buble is putting out a Christmas album.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:57,040
It's a game changer. It's Jeezu and it's Nora Jones together again. Oh, Jesus. I do miss him.

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,120
This is an advice show for the modern era. We are on our holiday creep, on the Christmas creep,

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:11,920
a slow death march to the birth of Jesus. And then to 2012 and then it's all over. And then in

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,600
2012, Ragnarok. It's going to be great. But for now, we still have a lot of people that need our

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,560
help. And we're going to be here with you until Quetzalcoatl unhinges his jaw, until he swallows

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,960
this world whole. And we will be probably live streaming that when that event happens. But for

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,640
right now, Quetzalcoatl takes our torsos from us. Yeah, flies them into heaven. Give that back.

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,960
Hey, hey, I was using that torso Quetzalcoatl. God, I hope I'm pronouncing that wrong.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,960
It's so key. Hey, I'm a married 30 year old dude with two young ones, self-employed,

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,920
good at projects, completing projects on my own. I want to do a little self-improvement,

25
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,800
eat better, spend less money on junk food, lose the gut, stop biting my nails, etc.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
But I always fail to follow through on any self-improvements I want to make.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,120
Hey, where do I get the willpower to follow through on making a better me? Willis in Watertown.

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:21,280
You know how to do it. Yeah, they actually sell willpower now in different ways. You just got to

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,680
seek it. You got to seek it out. Like, for instance, I've been really bad about taking

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,320
my vitamins every day. So yesterday I went to the Walgreens and I bought new vitamins.

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,080
I bought some Genesis Today immunity boosting super fruit gummies and some fish oil. And I

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,520
bought one of those seven day sort of like one of those Advent calendars, but for old people who

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,640
forget to take their medicine. Yes. And now I put my vitamins in that. Wait, hold on a second. Are

34
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,160
you telling me that you, my 17 year old little brother, is rocking a pill caddy? Yeah, I got a

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,880
pill caddy. You have a pill caddy? It's sleek and it's stylish. I picked the one that had this

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,880
font that's now. That's now and today. Do you find it difficult finding a place to keep that

37
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,920
on your rascal? Did you pick the one? When you picked it, did you consider your children or

38
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,720
perhaps your children's children reluctantly throwing it away after you die? Oh, he didn't

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,920
take Sundays. Look, look at this. This Saturn is the last one he took. I hate to throw it away,

40
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,960
but listen, Pea Paw's not in that pill caddy. He's up in heaven. Listen, you look at that

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,240
pill caddy and you think this is an 80 year old man, but you pop it, you pop that treasure chest

42
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,440
and you see those immunity boosting super fruit gummies from Genesis Today. You know that this is

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
a young man's game. You know what? I want to get one of those pill caddies now and just fill it

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,680
with jelly bellies. These are Tuesday's jelly bellies. If you don't have a pill caddy now,

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,200
you're not going to live to need one. Are you guys taking your super fruit?

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,440
I don't know what you're saying. How do you feel about acai?

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,920
Uh, I, I feel like you're super fruit gummies. It sounds like they might have

48
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,320
gelatin in it or, or, or some other animal based product. And that's against my lifestyle. So

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,480
just as a sign that to the people at home know when Griffin says he's super fruit gummies,

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,760
he's talking about sour patch kids. He doesn't know any better. Yeah. We told him that those

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,400
are long time ago. We told them those are super fruit gummies. If you hear them talk about eating

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,400
the red ones, make me strong. Strong. If you hear him talk about eating a health sponge,

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
that's a Twinkie. What you got right there. He does not know full of life cream. What?

54
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Life cream. That's life cream. No, don't say that. Look at the energy meat on a super bun.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
That's a big Mac. Yeah. That is a hamburger eating there. As far as like finding the willpower to do

56
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
it. I like to surround myself with friends that will just like reach out and poke my, my muffin

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,640
tops and just be like, Hey, you look fat. You look fat today and I'll get you out there running.

58
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:22,160
The problem is you're, you're trying to fix too much because if you're trying to fix four things,

59
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,120
then when your willpower falters, you're going to let one of them go and think, well,

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm going to jettison this, but I'll keep the other things. It's like, like a, you know,

61
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
like take it on water, right? You're going to bail something over through your, through your, uh,

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,120
stop biting my nails boudoir over the edge of the Titanic, just so you could preserve the lose the

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:53,840
gut, uh, uh, armoire. Um, so you gotta pick one thing and stick with it. And you got to set a

64
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,640
reward, a goal for yourself. Say if I lose these 30 pounds or whatever it is, I want to buy myself

65
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,240
a shredding electric guitar. Yeah. You know, something I can, like Stevie Ray Vaughan,

66
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
I guess RV would rock. And then you got to stick to it and you can't be like, well, three pounds,

67
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
well, I'm still getting my guitar. I'm going to get a 10th of a guitar. You can't work that way.

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
It's not going to be any good to you. You just got the bridge. Health is all about tricking yourself

69
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,040
and thinking these horrible, horrible things you have to do to keep yourself from dying are really

70
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,680
fun. That's why I'm down with that fitocracy jam. It turns like exercise and they're like an RPG.

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,240
And it's like, you get 10 constitution and also no diabetes. Now exercise is a constant battle

72
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,240
to realize that the extension of your life by five or 10 years is still, it is infinitesimal

73
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,600
in the grand scheme of things. The universe has been around for millions of years. You're 60

74
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,280
years, bumping it up to 70, convincing yourself like that matters is the secret behind exercise.

75
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,880
If you guys can figure that out, well, please, by all means, you host this show. Cause I don't know.

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,600
Uh, you know, psychologically, you can't look past giving yourself a gold star chart. Like it's very

77
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,720
childish, but man, it works. It feels good to slap a gold star up on the wall. It feels good to empty

78
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,840
a caddy. You guys need to get down with my way of living. I'm telling you, it feels good when you

79
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,920
remember like, Oh, it's Tuesday, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Nothing better than a clean caddy.

80
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Oh, is that what it sounds like? The sound effects probably help. Get as many gummies as you can.

81
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,520
Cause they're the new thing. They're new. They're what's now. They're super fruit. Get healthy. Uh,

82
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,800
Hey brothers, there's this girl I met in my college class. I really like her. Um, that sounds

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
like something somebody would say who doesn't really go to college. I met her at a college

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,760
class. We had all the other football studs. We're working on our mathers. Okay. So I really like

85
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,040
her. She seemed really into me and she asked for my number. We've been texting for about three weeks.

86
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Then I found out she has a boyfriend. She constantly goes on about how awesome and funny I

87
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,400
am. And we've hung out a few times as well as going out to eat. She's even told me the last

88
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,320
time we went out that her and her BF were having some fights and might break up. Is this the way

89
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,840
boys and girls act as friends in real life? Or is she lining me up for after love struck in the US?

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,720
She, she is playing pool with hearts. Yeah. She's heart pool. You got your eight ball lined up over

91
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,480
your quarter pocket, but she got to sink that four ball first. So she's shooting that four ball

92
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,800
in a manner that will leave the queue lined up to sink the eight. At best she is lining you up

93
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,640
for after she wakes up with her boyfriend. At worst, she is using you to feel better about the

94
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,360
fact that she is having fights with her boyfriend. Oh God, she's doubling down. She's a poker

95
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,600
metaphor. Yeah. And at both, you are on the short end of this particular relationship step, my

96
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,400
friend. You are a pawn in this game. Why do people ask us the questions that it would solve their

97
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,600
problem to ask the other person? Yeah. Listen, just take this copy and paste it and sext it over to

98
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
her. Just send it like, Hey, what's up? What is the question and a picture of my dick? Just real

99
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:27,600
quick. Give you a full picture. I'll give you a scope of the situation. There's a rat. This is

100
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,880
one of those things. Okay. I think a new, a new good yardstick for problems is if you're not

101
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,840
comfortable asking the person this question, there's a problem. Yeah. Like if you are having

102
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,600
this doubt that you aren't comfortable bringing up with the other person, it's bad times. It's a

103
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,480
bad scene at that very best. You're you, you are emotionally cuckolding this gentleman. Yeah. You

104
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,640
don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be the, the, the Mr. Mr. Consolation or Mr. You know,

105
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,520
you're not, you're, you're not a solution. You know, you're not the, the, the fix all to all of

106
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,480
life's problems. You're just a guy trying to make his way. Especially because it is a, is a trap to

107
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,800
be the better than the boyfriend guy. Oh yeah. One, you're setting yourself up on a pedestal and

108
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,240
she's like, you know, she's sitting, this guy is great. Why isn't my boyfriend more like him? He's

109
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,840
great. And then you're a normal guy, just like everyone else. You got problems, you got problems,

110
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,400
you got shortcomings, just like everyone else. You're not better than this guy. You're just

111
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,880
different from that guy. And then two, she has a boyfriend. Like, do you really want to be with

112
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,320
someone that is with someone else and wanting to date you? Like that doesn't bode well for the

113
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,080
future. Yeah. That's the troubling thing about her character, I think. But you might be reading too

114
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,320
much into it. Maybe she's not seeing the situation this way. It sounds like she, she is, but of

115
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,400
course you've only got your perspective, so it's hard to say. Why don't you pump the brakes?

116
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,720
Pump them. And then if she breaks up with her boyfriend, then you can pick back up on this

117
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,600
storyline. But for right now, there's too much going on that you probably don't want to be a

118
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
part of. You might even let her know that and say, Hey, I think you're great and I have a really

119
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
great time with you, but until this whole boyfriend situation gets worked out, I think we should just

120
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,880
be friends and cool it, you know, with like the going out and hanging out and stuff like that.

121
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,360
I, that's not going to work though. Cause he really likes her. You can't be friends with

122
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
someone you really like. First he has to really like himself. You gotta, you gotta just, there's

123
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,240
no way that this situation can unfold. That's not going to end with Joey Greco kicking down your

124
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:42,080
door. Like, Hey, Hey, I knew all along. Gotcha. On his show. Gotcha. You know, if you go into

125
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,600
this relationship and you, you are going in as the guy, she left the other guy for it,

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,720
your bar is going to be way high right out of the gate. I, I believe personally that the first two

127
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,720
weeks of your relationship should be the equivalent of signing a release form before you bungee jump.

128
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,080
As if to say, if you are still here, you fully understand the risks that you are taking on in

129
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,040
this, in this situation. It should be the very worst of you. And if she's still there,

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,600
nowhere to go but up, but on ramp onto the highway, the opportunity to like swerve into the shoulder.

131
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Lady, this is the highway to disappointment. And you should probably just pull off and

132
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,840
stop at that freshest big boy and dry your sorrows in a cup of mud.

133
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,040
This coffee is good, by the way, I'm having some coffee of my own. Um, I, I really do think that

134
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,400
this is one of those situations where you're going to save yourself so much heartache. Yeah. By just

135
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,880
having the conversation, just, you gotta be. So it's so adult and mature to have that conversation.

136
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,480
I think it makes you look really good. If you don't approach it like, bitch, you playing me?

137
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,160
If you're like, hey, listen, let's. Well, no. I'm sorry. Approach it like what?

138
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
I said what I said. How do you think? Yeah, we all heard.

139
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

140
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm just, I'm disappointed in Travis. I am as well. I too am disappointed in my performance.

141
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Um, you got to run away, run away from a baby because it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt.

142
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Even if you come to her and have a combo, how's that combo? Cause it's going to be pretty bad.

143
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,720
It's going to be rough for you. Going to be rough for her. You've realized the situation. You see

144
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,400
this train just screaming towards you. You don't try to have a convo with the train. Like, Hey,

145
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,640
would you mind? Oh, you gingerly step off the tracks and then run away. Right. There is,

146
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,880
there is the possibility with the conversation option that you start to have the conversation.

147
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,640
She says, um, I have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah. Or she says, Oh, but I don't. And

148
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,960
then she pulls out a boob and then you're sunk. You're sunk. That's always a danger. Sure.

149
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,880
So maybe this is a situation if you just go into it and keep your wits about you and keep your head

150
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,000
on a swivel and you know that there might be some shady business going on. Like you're already leaps

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,600
and bounds like ahead of everyone else. So if you go into this going, this could turn out badly.

152
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,120
I need to protect myself here and just be careful. You know, maybe it'll end up being great and true

153
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,120
love and awesome. I really feel like this is one area where our, uh, you know, our past of arranging

154
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,200
marriages and the very sort of direct way that those situations were handled. Like the one sort

155
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:49,200
of leg up it has on our modern system is that by our sort of modern etiquette, there's not even a

156
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,160
way to have a con. It's like getting an actor's equity card. Like you can't get into an equity

157
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
show without a card, but you can't get the card unless you're in one of the shows. That's what,

158
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,320
like, that's the sort of position we've painted ourselves into with relationships these days.

159
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Like you're, you're, we're so, uh, used to sort of like our online interactions and, and, and,

160
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,960
and, you know, disassociating through texts and stuff like that, that we've lost that very basic

161
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,960
ability to go to somebody and say, Hey, I'm going to have this conversation with you face to face.

162
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,440
And I miss that, that, that's something that business-like sort of, uh, you know,

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,160
I would like to court you. We are courting now. I'm I, you can either my pen here is my written.

164
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Please sign this document. Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question? A Yahoo answer that you could

165
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,280
take? I have five. Yeah. Read all of them back to back to back to back to back. Okay, here we go. Um,

166
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,600
this Yahoo was, uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield. Thank you, Lisa. It's by Yahoo

167
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:00,000
answers user Matt L who asks cool band names for metal band. My band has been wanting to do a show

168
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,680
for some time now, but we have one small problem. We can't think of a good band name. We are a metal

169
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,840
death metal band and our songs are original. Please help. Mercury.

170
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,640
Travis has mercury. Justin, do you have any other Greek gods slash planets that you want to drop?

171
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,880
I was actually going for a metallic, uh, substance. You clever fuck. I know, right?

172
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,840
God, that's good. Yeah. It's really juicy. It's a really, it's a really juicy vein of comedy.

173
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:40,080
You struck a real nice vein. Uh, these laws go 10 feet deep.

174
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,320
You know what helps, uh, any joke? If the person has to have a rudimentary understanding of, uh,

175
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,280
the chemical table before they, they, uh, laugh at it. Yeah. Yeah. Which in this,

176
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,320
this day and age, most people do, I would say breaking bad. Everybody knows most of the symbols

177
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,640
now. It is not at all called the chemical table. What the fuck is it called? Periodical table of

178
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,800
elements. You idiot child. Are you sure it's periodical and not periodic? It's periodical.

179
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. It's a magazine table of magazines. This is a show for

180
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,880
stupids. Like where it's made by. For and by. For and by dumbos. Uh, do you guys want to hear some

181
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:39,120
of the responses that Yahoo has provided? Yeah, I do. Uh, says glass rose, guilty witness,

182
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,920
guilty witnesses, unfortunate, unfortunate residents. Holy sins. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Unfortunate

183
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,960
residents. This, I love this apartment. The, the, the, the roofing is just terrible. There is,

184
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,400
there is blood everywhere. Yeah. How unfortunate residents. It's great. Our neighbors are very

185
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:09,280
noisy. Um, holy sins, flesh deep Saturn nine. Well flush deep. He's just combining two things

186
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,880
that don't mean the same thing. Also flesh deep. It's not that deep friend. No, but he's saying

187
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,480
like holy sin. Two things together. This is fire. This is great. Rainy sun. Uh, two and a half

188
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,880
blank bodies, knives, idk. Wait, what? Two and a half men? Two and a half men, sure. Two and a

189
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,160
half. That, I think it's a, I think he's saying you should make your death metal band a parody

190
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:46,000
off two and a half men's name. Two and like two and a half bodies. Um, humanities experiment.

191
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,320
That's okay. It's, it's me. Drew has some really good ones. Oh God. I was hoping that was a man.

192
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
It's me. Drew. Hey, it's me. Drew. Time to rock.

193
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,200
And also I need to borrow like 50 bucks. Yeah. It's me. Drew drops club bangers. Like

194
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,960
like gorging through infected city.

195
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:24,640
The city sucks. Uh, in engaging fate, burning, burning savior, um, gunning down hatred.

196
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,240
Get over here. Hatred falling death metal, like up with the people band. Yeah. We're bringing down

197
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:41,840
hatred. Time to work it out. Let's have a powwow. Be nice to your dad. Falling into purgatory,

198
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,320
smoke, smoking infection, or maybe smoking infection. Um, what about just trust falls?

199
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:02,240
How would that be as a death metal man? Ladies and gentlemen, we are hands around the world.

200
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:12,320
Hell break. Hell break. Oh, it's 10 30. Time for a hell break. That's what hell break is.

201
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
What Satan takes every time he goes up to produce a new day. Matthew's band album.

202
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh, I'm on a hell break. Just chilling. Hey, I like any band name that when your fans come to

203
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,600
all fans, I use the term loosely when random people wander into the venue and they go,

204
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,400
excuse me, what, what's the name of this gorging through? Okay, cool. What does that mean? I don't

205
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,680
know. Um, but I definitely don't want a t-shirt. I'm sticking around. Excuse me. May I gorge through?

206
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:52,800
Okay. Your best bet, I think for this particular band is to pick a name that is almost the name

207
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,680
of another metal band so that people will get confused and come see your show. Scuttle of mud.

208
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Yeah. Did you go see Metallica's?

209
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,920
It's the plural. Metallico. I went and saw Spain this weekend. They were awesome.

210
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,080
They did that one song. Fuck. If I could drop a stained parody title right now, that would be

211
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:27,360
really good. I want to see God. That's good. That's a band, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's a band

212
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,680
that's still relevant that anybody listening to the show knows who it is. I want to go see 411.

213
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:41,360
They're definitely right. Justin, that is so far from a metal band.

214
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,880
Amber is the color of your blood.

215
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Let's move on. Hey, metal, your whole universe is the fucking pits.

216
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,200
Just a quick side note here before we move on. Your world sucks.

217
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,200
It's an infected city over there. I hate it. I just have to make my opinion here known,

218
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,880
and that is that it's a joke. You're a joke. It's like listening to a 56k modem dial up.

219
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,040
You're a joke. Hey, people say to us, my brother, my brother and me, you guys are good,

220
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,440
and we like our questions that we send in, but why can't some famous people get involved? I want to

221
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,840
hear the quandaries of the superhuman, by which we mean, of course, other hosts of podcasts.

222
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,440
This is part two in our ongoing celebrity feature. This week we have a question from

223
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,200
our dear friends Tim and Simon, who, of course, from the UK host Tim and Simon's Brains Bill. Can

224
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,320
we title this segment of the show Internet Celebrities? They're Just Like Us. Yes, we can.

225
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,280
This is part two of Internet Celebrities. They're Just Like Us with our friends, Tim and Simon.

226
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,800
Greetings, brothers McElroy. Hello from the other side of the Atlantic. We are Tim and Simon. My

227
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,720
name's Simon. And my name is Tim. You may know us from our podcast Tim and Simon's Brains Bill.

228
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,560
We have a quandary for you guys. Yeah. We are only 24 years of age. Yeah, yeah. Lots of people

229
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,160
confuse us for being much older, usually in our mid thirties. Yeah. That's mainly you though.

230
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,600
You've got a face like a withered old man. You're like Benjamin Button in the early stages of his

231
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,920
life. I am. And it doesn't help that I've had a beard since I was born. That's true. That is true.

232
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,760
I was born with a beard. Yeah. I've got no real excuse. I just got a haggard old face. We just

233
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,320
both look a bit older than I is. So what we need is advice from you. So people stop thinking that

234
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,040
we're older than 24. How can we make ourselves appear like 24 year olds and not like middle age

235
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:00,960
man? Tim and Simon, thank you so much for your question. I think your first problem is your

236
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:12,400
dialect. Yeah. I think when people think British, they think been around forever. Old news, old

237
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,760
old old empire. Dusty. Dusty, I think maybe even if we can say dusty. People think of Peter O'Toole

238
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,200
like right out the gate. Pretty much every British person is Peter. Peter O'Toole, if you have that

239
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,280
accent. So the first thing you gotta young that up. What are some upcoming ethnicities or regions

240
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,440
that they could maybe emulate the dialects of to get it? I think like at the USA level,

241
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
you're just going to sound ridiculous. You're going to sound like the guy from Avatar

242
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,560
because no one can really nail that American sound. No, we're so special. We're very special

243
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,800
is the thing. What about Esperanto? Well, another language. So not exactly. Then they would be,

244
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,080
I mean, there would be hard to understand, which I don't know if you guys agree with this,

245
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,000
but I think that youth culture is very difficult for me to understand. So maybe that's an approach

246
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,440
they can take. Is is is it possible to say things in the English language in a Japanese

247
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,360
dialect without sounding racist? No, no, it's not. Believe me, I've been experimenting with

248
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,040
this for years. After extensive testing on the periodical table, Travis has discovered

249
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,480
that you can you cannot emulate a Japanese accent without not only that, but there are a lot of

250
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,560
Ruby Tuesdays I am no longer welcome at. Hey guys, maybe just maybe just some baggy pants.

251
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,720
What do you think of that? And like an I'm with stupid shirt that points up at your face.

252
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,560
Just sag them out and then an I'm with stupid shirt. Sag it and and maybe can we can we do

253
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,560
can we freshen up those? Nick, can we can Tim become Timmy and Simon become Simmy?

254
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:03,520
No, welcome to Timmy and Simmy's brain. Spimmy. I think that what always says young get a backpack.

255
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,320
Or that also can say I live with my mom. Maybe a backpack or maybe like a drug addiction.

256
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,240
It's a white. That's pretty young. That's pretty hip. Yeah, kids love that. Beth, Beth, I whenever

257
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,520
I wear a ball cap to a bar, I'm always carded because a ball cap makes me look like not only

258
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,720
a young child, but a young sick child. Like your make a wish was to go to a bar. Yeah,

259
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,880
like you can't drink. You have tuberculosis like I promise I don't know. I don't remember.

260
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,800
One of you has a beard. Man, listen, I know beard is a rockin look, but nothing says

261
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,360
like I'm I'm an old man like a beard unless you unless I'm carded unless you braid it.

262
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,280
Yeah, throw a pigtail on that bitch. Braid it and then start playing violin for Arcade

263
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,120
Fire and you are off to the young races. I have to stop the show right now and ask if Arcade Fire

264
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,840
is the only band that Justin knows exists because every time we talk about young people, it's always

265
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,000
join the Arcade Fire with you. What you're going to want to do is tell people you're a member of

266
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,600
the Polyphonic Spree. Here's the thing with the Arcade Fire. OK, I will tell you that Arcade Fire

267
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,480
I mean, it's great value as a comedy resource for someone who's like myself now 31 years old

268
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,040
and a steady descent into 40 and irrelevance like Arcade Fire. First off, nobody knows who's in it

269
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,600
because there's so many of them. So that's good. It's an unbearably pretentious name that is

270
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:44,400
inherently kind of funny and two and three. Nobody really knows what instruments are in it, so like

271
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,280
you can pick any instrument and no one's going to call you on it. Do you understand? Justin,

272
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,160
did you just say that their name is funny? Unbearably pretentious, I think is what I said.

273
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Do you not know that it references the 1972 great Arcade Fire? Is that what it references?

274
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,600
Yeah, so many Pac-Man games lost their lives.

275
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,680
And Pac-Man players. That's where the term Pac-Man fever came from.

276
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,240
That's what actually burning up. Yeah, that's actually what Pac-Man fever is literally being

277
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,120
caught ablaze while playing Pac-Man. And the problem is, is they wouldn't stop playing.

278
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,000
No, I haven't. I still have like two lives left. That's actually had no lives left.

279
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,080
That's how he lost Billy Mitchell Sr. That's why he swore to beat every video game.

280
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,520
He literally reached life's kill screen. Yeah, quite literally. So and then he leveled up to

281
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:43,680
heaven. So make some, uh, make some jokes about arcade games from 1973. That can help.

282
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,160
Young Yup. Tim and Simon. That could be. Maybe get yourself like an 18 year old girlfriend.

283
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,760
Hey, it's been working for, uh, it's been working for George Clooney all these years.

284
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,560
He still looks great. Yeah, look at Hugh Hefter. He is, he is timeless. Oh, that's, that's good.

285
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,960
That's a deep cut to have young metal for old man with young women. You really went out to

286
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:11,440
the boneyard for that one. Literally out to the boneyard in this case, of course. Um, uh, so guys,

287
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,800

Griffin, how about a jingle for our friends at cash text invite.com?

309
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:56,320
I can try. It's been so long. You still got the heat. Magic fingers. Let's see if I do.

310
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,120
Hey, that's spinach. You like it's on sale. Here's a dollar. Do you need a back rub for five bucks?

311
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,720
You do. And here's the five bucks you need to get the back rub that we mentioned to you

312
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,080
on your cell phone. No, we don't advertise for Pojop stores yet, but we'll get around to it.

We are cash texts.

314
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,400
Oh, let me try one more time. That was great. There's no reason to try again.

315
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,960
Okay. You nailed it. Cash text invite.com. Thank you guys so much.

316
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,080
Hello there. My name is Graham Clark. And I'm Dave Shumka. And together we host a podcast called

317
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,280
Stop Podcasting Yourself. This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to

318
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,400
it in your pod. What's that about? You ask. Well, who are you to ask? Who do you think you are? Yeah,

319
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,480
get lost, bozo. We're a couple of standup comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

320
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,680
And every week we bring a guest on the show. Sometimes they're Canadian. Sometimes they're not.

321
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,560
Sometimes they're a ghost. It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat. Plus

322
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:27,360
we're Canadian. So you get a tax break. You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

323
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:36,880
Do you guys want a yahoo? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Well, not if you're going to be so shitty about it.

324
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes. Why do you always ask like we've ever said no? Just tear right into it. Like a fat kid. Hey,

325
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,240
motherfuckers. It's yahoo time. Like a fat kid eating a health sponge. Just dig right in. In

326
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,760
case anyone is wondering, yahoo time is a great name for a metal band. Yeah, so is brain spill.

327
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,720
We're yahoo serious time. Let's do it. We are the yahoo serious fan club. This one's going to be

328
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:10,880
timely. This one was sent in by Michael Cornely. Thank you, Michael. It's by yahoo answers user

329
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,720
Jamie who asks, my boyfriend is addicted to Skyrim. Okay, so yesterday my BF got Skyrim,

330
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:27,680
a random game. First off, Jamie, no. It's a fantasy epic from Bethesda. Learn something.

331
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,960
And ever since he's been playing it so much. Usually if he gets a game, he would just play

332
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,160
it for one or two hours then get bored of it. But he's been playing this thing for at least nine

333
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,000
hours straight now. The only things he would get up from the computer to is to go to the bathroom.

334
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,680
He wouldn't even bother to get food and I was scared that he would starve. So I ordered him

335
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,840
some pizza and then he just ate it by the computer while playing. When I went to bed,

336
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,080
he was still playing. When I woke up this morning, he was still playing. Usually he likes sex at

337
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,120
least twice a day, but he won't leave the computer even to have sex. So since I'm always thinking of

338
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,360
him, I gave him a BJ and the whole time he was still on the computer. I'm so worried. I'm so

339
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,120
worried about him. What should I do? Hey, hey lady, your boyfriend's a goddamn mastermind.

340
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,440
I'm so fucking jealous right now. With the magic, by the virtue of playing this,

341
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,440
he played this video game so hard that you delivered him pizza and blow jobs. What are

342
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,640
you talking about? Whilst playing the game, he was simultaneously playing you.

343
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,320
Right. And he won. Love is the ultimate game. Do you realize how mad you've driven him with,

344
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
like, he's driven- With power.

345
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,080
Yeah. You can never retrieve this relationship. It's over.

346
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
And while getting a blow job, he was just chanting,

347
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,800
What are you doing, lady? Have you not been in a relationship before? That's not how you get

348
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,960
anything. Here, I got you this pizza. Please be okay. I'm so worried about you.

349
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,040
Please, I got you these blow jobs. You just have to live.

350
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,880
The only way that his life could've been better is if you had said he had figured out a way to

351
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
not have to get up to also go to the bathroom. Right. Like, if he had worked out some kind of

352
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,920
complex pulley system. I love my boyfriend so much that I gave him the human centipede.

353
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,920
It was really important to him to- I bought him a chamber pot.

354
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
Griffin, can you- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

355
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,880
What you gotta do is you gotta get a pizza and make a blow job face. I'm not sure how

356
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,920
that part would work. And you put it near him and then you throw it against the wall.

357
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,280
And you say, nope, that's- You throw your face against the wall?

358
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,760
The blow job face pizza against the wall. Griffin, are you on muscle relaxants?

359
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm on some sort of relaxant. What you gotta do is you got to get a pizza and spell out the words

360
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,600
blow job? Question mark in pepperonis. And you give that to him. And then right when he's about

361
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,560
to take his first bite, you slap it out of his hand and you say, maybe leave this magical world,

362
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,440
this magical fantasy dragon filled world and come get this sex pizza instead.

363
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,400
Come get this sex pizza. I'm ready. I know that this is in no way what the problem is about,

364
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,920
but I'm actually more worried about this guy because usually when he spends 50 to 60 dollars

365
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,440
on a video game, he plays for an hour and gets bored. Hey, you're wasting your money.

366
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,600
Yeah, dude, are you okay? Like, are you picking shitty games? Are you just like really, really

367
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,960
bored really easily? Griffin, can you read the- I saw this yahoo and someone submitted it. Can you

368
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,760
read the answer that was that was also submitted? The top response? The top response is by McNamara

369
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,160
who says, why can't I get a girlfriend like you? I don't think that's the one I was thinking of.

370
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,080
LMAO, are you for real? You give him BJ while he's playing Skyrim. Try unplugging the computer

371
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,480
and stop feeding him. Eventually he gets hungry. There was someone who said he could not be

372
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,800
addicted because he had only been playing for nine hours. Please just let the man play.

373
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,000
I do like that that she is distracting him with her pizza blow jobs and and she needs-

374
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,960
That's the great concern. There is a rampant problem in this country of people distracting

375
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,760
their boyfriends while playing Skyrim. Hey, I mean, let's get our priorities straight. Those

376
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,600
dark brotherhood contracts aren't going to fulfill themselves, right? You guys don't know, right?

377
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,920
Exactly. I'm I would like to apologize to the non-gaming part of our audience that we just

378
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,480
ostracized. Yeah, we'll move on to something else right now. Whenever I'm over at someone's house as

379
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,920
a guest, I always get uncomfortable about asking to eat their food. Even when it's offered to me,

380
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,320
my instinctive reaction is to politely decline unless everyone is sitting down for dinner.

381
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,480
This does not happen with acquaintances as one might expect, but also when I'm at a good friend's

382
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,320
house or even my girlfriend's place, I will end up going the whole day without eating sometimes

383
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,000
because of this. What am I supposed to do? That's from Hungry Man. You're supposed to eat-

384
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,520
Eat the food! You'll die if you don't! Why are you people doing this to us? You just-

385
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,400
I went away for a weekend and I starved to death. You're supposed to eat the food!

386
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,800
If someone- Okay, if you go into someone's kitchen and you pop it open and start hunting for

387
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,960
gushers and open bags of Doritos, like that sucks. Don't do that. But if someone's like,

388
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,440
hey, do you want some gushers? Yeah. Are you hungry? Can I get you something, my man?

389
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:35,280
We have such an overabundance in this country that it is a privilege. It is a genuine privilege

390
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:43,200
to be able to share your abundance with people. It spans all kind of different cultural groups,

391
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,360
but the ability to give someone food and give someone something makes the giver feel good

392
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,280
as well. So it's like, hey man, can I get you something from my home to you? And you're like,

393
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,120
yeah, I'd love a PB&J. And then they're happy to give you a PB&J. That is not always true.

394
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,440
I got to say, I'm sorry, I've never offered gushers to a guest in a manner that wasn't

395
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,640
obligatory. I have never, I have never in good conscience given a man gushers. Never,

396
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,520
never before. Cause I just can't stop thinking about you only, you pay like three bucks for a

397
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,040
box and you only get six packs in the box. So by eating that, the man is eating 50 cents.

398
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,320
Okay. So like for you, Griffin, it balances out like if you're giving them some rice

399
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,080
or like some grain. Yeah. Oh man. Take this Uncle Ben's. It's yours. That's cool. But leave the

400
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,600
gushers, but leave the gushers. Like if you see me going to my kitchen and eat gushers,

401
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,600
I don't want to see you looking at me all doe eyed like, I wish you could offer me some gushers.

402
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,560
You want her to ask for the gushers? I don't even want them to ask. I want them to

403
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,680
respect the privacy of my gushers time. I hate when I get hungry when I have guests over and

404
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,760
I have to eat my secret special food because they always want it. Okay. But that's, that's where the

405
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,680
good balance is for this dude is if someone offers it to you, you don't have to take it,

406
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,640
but you also don't have to say no. I think he needs to respect. And I think he needs to recognize

407
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,040
when the food that person is eating is their special food. If they're, if they go in the

408
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,480
kitchen and start eating some Ritz crackers. Yeah. You can go ahead and ask them to break you off a

409
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,600
piece. But if they get into some fucking vanilla dip pretzel flips, then guess what? Keep your

410
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,840
grubby hands and your mind hands off those flips with a Z. Here, those double dip Oreos you got

411
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,520
there? Yeah. Yes, they're theirs. Yeah, they're mine. I'd prefer it if you leave me in peace.

412
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,200
And don't- Here's the thing. There are very few things that holds true for me, but if I'm eating

413
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,040
some fucking Girl Scout cookie- See? That comes, that comes around once a year, you bitch. Yeah.

414
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,320
Don't, I have a limited supply of my Thin Mints. And don't say that there's no difference between

415
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,840
foods, you bitch. Because there is, there is a difference. There's a difference. Some foods

416
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,160
are special and you need to, you need to keep your hands off. Like for example, you can have

417
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,080
my peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but you better not lay a finger on my Butterfinger.

418
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,880
Right, exactly. And candy bars, they're mine. Please. If there's an, if there's an ad campaign

419
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,320
about somebody trying to get a certain food, you should probably assume that it's not for you

420
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,720
because it's prohibitively expensive. Don't, don't take somebody's tricks. Hey, let me get a- Crazy

421
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,720
guest. Tricks are for me. Let me get a, let me get a dip of that Big League Chew. I don't think so.

422
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,360
I don't think so. I went to Rite Aid to get this. I specifically made a trip just for this.

423
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,240
My solution for Hungry Man is to just never leave the house without a pocket full of gorp.

424
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,440
Just, just, you've always got to be able to carb and protein up with whatever's in your pockets.

425
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,600
A camel back full of like tomato soup.

426
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,760
Like go in those hats with two cans of tomato soup.

427
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,040
You just have to politely find a way to say,

428
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:05,120
those Gushers look great. I will settle for a toast. Do you have a toast that I can have?

429
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,480
Give me your shittiest food that you hate and will never eat.

430
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,160
Oh, I think that's a good, I think that's a good transition into what someone's like,

431
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,280
Hey, can I get you something? You say, yes. The worst thing you have,

432
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,680
the thing you will never touch. I will take those pickled cherries and I will eat that.

433
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah. I got some pickled cherries and I got some Zataran's Jambalaya mix that I thought

434
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
I would eat, but I don't think I ever will. Do you have any of those?

435
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,200
Half a bag of dry ramen noodles and some Dusseldorf style mustard.

436
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,440
Enjoy.

437
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
He was my favorite Harry Potter character.

438
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,480
Style mustard would be a good name for a band.

439
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
Actually. Now that I think about it,

440
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,680
we call your heavy metal band style mustard.

441
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,000
Hey, I'm a lady and I'm crushing hard on a guy playing the same rec-

442
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,480
Let him up.

443
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,480
Giantess. We play on the same rec league soccer team.

444
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,040
So we see each other and have friendly chats once a week.

445
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,520
Our team plays late on a week night. So there's no going out for drinks afterwards.

446
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,200
He's single, straight, intuitively dreamy. Can a girl ask out a guy?

447
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,560
I mean, it's 2011, right? That's from crushing in Canada.

448
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,200
Let me answer your question. It is 2011.

449
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
If that's your query.

450
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,840
This is sexist almost. Hey, you're a sexist. Of course a girl can ask out a guy. You sexist.

451
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,800
I don't even think that's like a debate question.

452
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,640
Is it? That's what I'm saying.

453
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,920
I don't think you're going to find anybody who goes, no, like, yeah.

454
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,680
Hey, lady, are you not? But lady, are you not laying in on thick enough?

455
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,280
Does he not know? Does he not know? Do you not?

456
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,920
I mean, I am saying that that that anyone can ask anyone out because guess what?

457
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,320
Everyone sucks at it because you either do it and you're like,

458
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,880
could I kiss your boobs or hey, let's do a thing.

459
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,640
Or you're so fucking Rico Suave that you give everyone in like a 15 foot cone in front of you.

460
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,800
Douche chills when you ask someone out.

461
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,720
I guess it's I guess it's more that girls are on the like on point,

462
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,040
like prepared to be asked out by guys.

463
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,640
If you ask a guy out, it might catch him off guard and he will then go home and go.

464
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
Did she just ask me out? What was that?

465
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,280
In my experience, the only time I've been able to successfully ask me

466
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,960
was when I catch him off guard.

467
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,720
Surprise is a huge element of it.

468
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,520
Jump out from behind a bush or pop out of the locker.

469
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,160
They can't see it coming. It's gotta be like,

470
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,640
do you want to go out and can you pass the butter?

471
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,440
Because then it's like, yes, yes.

472
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,600
OK, you've got a great.

473
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,600
You've got a great in because you've got you're on a soccer team with him

474
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,320
so you can like dive tackle him and then like accident accidentally,

475
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,480
in quotes, touches balls while you while you both are on the ground.

476
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,200
Although if you're on the same team, I don't know why you dive tackle him.

477
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,440
Oh, because you saw a bee.

478
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,280
You saw a bee and so you dive tackled him.

479
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,800
So wouldn't that work in your day?

480
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,840
OK, but but who can't use the old bee gag?

481
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,640
I'm sorry a bee landed next to you.

482
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,560
You had a bee on your foot and oops, where's my hand?

483
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,160
So that's a good one for guys, too.

484
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,200
Guys, you see a lady out there catches your fancy.

485
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,560
Just go ahead and tackle her.

486
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,120
Just bring her down at her as hard as fast and furious.

487
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,400
Unfortunately, that is limited to it's seasonal because you can't do that in the winter.

488
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,680
Then you have to tackle her and say,

489
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,040
I'm sorry, there was the Yeti.

490
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,320
Yeah, this is no be no be since they are both on a soccer team.

491
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,760
Does the ask does her ask out have to be soccer themed?

492
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,160
She have to say, like, I'm ready for you to.

493
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm tired of shin guarding my heart.

494
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,960
I want you to take a penalty shot at my goal.

495
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,320
Yeah, let's go get dinner and then go to the yellow card concert.

496
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

497
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Yellow card is in a thing still.

498
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,280
I actually want to hear.

499
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,200
I don't know that yellow card was ever a thing.

500
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,000
If I could find you now.

501
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,080
Yeah, that was I want to hear Griffin's last breath.

502
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,360
So boring that I will settle for his last question.

503
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
When you do a penalty in soccer.

504
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,720
OK, first time you do it.

505
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,200
All right.

506
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,240
And called yellow.

507
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,960
OK, and then the Super Smash Brothers come out.

508
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,920
I wait.

509
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,520
Who are the no bash brothers?

510
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:23,920
Sorry.

511
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,320
Sorry.

512
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,440
I was going for a mighty dash.

513
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,760
Shut it down by Smash Mouth.

514
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,840
That's a great name for a metal band.

515
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,920
This is everything is happening is the worst thing.

516
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,400
Thank you so much to our friends, Tim and Simon.

517
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,040
You can get there.

518
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,240
Very funny podcast.

519
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,520
Tim and Simon Brain Spill.

520
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,800
That's Tim and Simon dot code dot UK.

521
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,760
Hey, go there and absorb them into your heart,

522
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,720
into your comedy heart.

523
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,000
And I believe they're also on Twitter as well.

524
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,800
But you'll have to go to their website to look that up.

525
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,880
I think they might just be at Tim and Simon.

526
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
So give it give them a shot.

527
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
I think you'll really enjoy what they're laying down.

528
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,280
We have a new shirt up.

529
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,200
It's at Max fun store dot com.

530
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,800
It is a brown people's nasty gum shirt.

531
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,560
It's it's a real delight.

532
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,320
And people are already posting pictures of them wearing the shirt.

533
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,800
Viva La Betty had her shirt on on Twitter.

534
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,920
Make sure you check out her feed and see how great that shirt looks.

535
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,760
Looks really sharp.

536
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,720
Justin and I are still growing mustaches

537
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,320
to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer research.

538
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:42,560
So please help support our dream of curing diseases with only our facial hair on our Movember.

539
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,280
You can just go to US dot Movember dot com and search for our names and we'll be right there.

540
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,880
And I, Justin, I don't know about you, but I am looking fabulous.

541
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,680
Yeah, I look really sharp.

542
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,960
On what level?

543
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
If you were going to compare it to a celebrity.

544
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,680
Sam Elliott.

545
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:58,820
Wow.

546
00:49:59,680 --> 00:49:59,920
Yeah.

547
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
And you just had that right off the cuff.

548
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,240
Yeah.

549
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,280
Well, it's because I've been told I went to a wedding this past week and they're like,

550
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,840
oh, I didn't know Sam Elliott was going to wait a sec.

551
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,280
Wait a tick.

552
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,280
Yeah, that's a boy.

553
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,040
Mine is more like Elliott from Scrubs.

554
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,600
Thank you to everyone tweeting about the show.

555
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,520

556
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,440
Just Bowie 23.

557

Z Force 915.

558
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,520
Everybody Darryl XD.

559
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,600
Lyrical nuisance.

560
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,400
Laura Copley.

561
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,960

Um, you can check out his show.

564
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,720
It's called pop quizzical to fun short quiz show that you can play along with.

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,640
Uh, thanks to Babylonia for tweeting about the show.

You're the best.

569
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,640
I want to thank John Roderick, John Roderick and the long winners for the use of their theme song.

570
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,040
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

571
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,120
It's so fucking good.

572
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:01,120
He's got a new song with Jonathan Colton called nemesis on a JoCo's JoCo's album.

573
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,200
Artificial heart that I have listened to probably a thousand times.

574
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,120
It's really good.

575
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,320
It's so good.

576
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,600
Listen to that and buy that long winter's album and then all the other ones.

577
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,560
Cause they're the best band.

578
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,680
Okay.

579
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,280
And, um, Oh, we got this live show coming up.

580
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,960
I think we've almost got a locale.

581
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,680
Is that accurate?

582
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,000
Griffin?

583
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,560
We do.

584
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,680
Um, I'm going to try, you're going to try and knock it down this week.

585
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,240
It's in Austin, Texas, if you didn't hear last week.

586
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,640
So if you live there, um, let us know, like on Twitter that you're going to go.

587
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,320
So you can sort of gauge it, you know?

588
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,800
Yeah.

589
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,520
Um, and, but listen, when we, I would follow our Twitter feed and, and follow and, and

590
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,000
join our Facebook group because when those tickets go live, there's not going to be a

591
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,960
ton of them.

592
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,520
Yeah.

593
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,120
Um, you want to act fast when those go on sale because there's not, there's not going

594
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,320
to be a, it's not going to be a huge, uh, uh, venue.

595
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,680
So you'll want to act fast when those tickets do go on sale.

596
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,520
Um, anything else?

597
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,400
Forums?

598
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,080
You want to get, you want to add an ad?

599
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,000
You want a personal ad or a corporate ad?

600
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Go to maximumfund.org for slash Jumbotron and we'll set that up for you.

601
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,720
And when you go to the forums, make sure you also check out the other wonderful shows on,

602
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,000
uh, on the maximumfund.org network and their forums and just let them know, you know, I'm

603
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,400
sure you're not going to go listen to stop podcasting yourself.

604
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,720
And when you do make sure that you, uh, go to their forums and tell them that the only

605
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,800
reason you listen to them is because of us.

606
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,200
Yeah.

607
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,880
That's going to make them feel great.

608
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,760
It's going to try them crazy with, with, with envy.

609
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,920
Um, Griffin, I'm ready.

610
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,680
This final Yahoo was, uh, also sent in by Lisa Holifield.

611
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,320
Thank you, Lisa.

612
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user IJR who asks, is it considered cheating if you sleep with the

613
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,480
demon that is possessing your wife or girlfriend?

614
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,240
Justin McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy.

615
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,520
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

616
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,160
Kiss your dad.

617
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:16,400
School wear on the lips.
