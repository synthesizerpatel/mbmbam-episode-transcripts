1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello, welcome my brother, my brother and me to the advice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. And normally we would be a little uneasy right now

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,880
because we didn't really prep what we were going to say at the beginning,

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,800
but the good news is I got the answer baby. I kind of guessed that because you were

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,560
chuckling through like you're saying your name and I was like oh he thought of something.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
Oh he's got some, he got that nudge. This is really, this is really good. You ready?

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah. MTV Movie Awards were last night.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh how did they go Justin? Didn't watch.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay. So.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,120
But here's how I think they went. Okay.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,320
Big wins all around for some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:35,920
Rebel Wilson was back. She's getting it done. I bet Adam Driver won for best villain if I had to guess.

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,320
Justin what are your favorite MTV Movie Awards specific categories? Not like your best actor,

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
your best actor. I'm talking specifics.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,320
Okay my favorite, if I had to make a list and it is, let me say,

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,160
so hard to choose. Okay. My favorite would be best actor who pretended to be short

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,840
by putting shoes on their knees like Tim Conway in Dwarf.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Yeah. Which is strangely a heavily contested,

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,920
like you'd be amazed how many people up for that every year.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Tom Hanks won that one. Tom Hanks won that one this year. For Bridge of Spies.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
You know it's funny, I actually, I think that it should have an asterisk because like he

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,000
actually had his legs cut off at the knees and shoes sewn to his knees and then afterwards

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,080
had his legs sewn back on. And that's like, we can't all afford that surgery Tom.

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
Exactly. I know you had to rule him out. I know you're on some method shit playing

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,680
little lawyer in Bridge of Spies, but it's not a fair and balanced field is it? It's bullshit.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,560
I like, I've always liked the best kiss category and I want to say a big congratulations to

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,320
Inside Out for that when all the emotions just had a big kissing party there at the end of Inside

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,480
Out. I really like that and I do want to say I was really surprised by the winner of the

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
best piss category and that's a new one for 2016.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
And who won that one Griffin? Who won that one? Who brought that home?

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,440
Also Inside Out.

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
Wow! Same scene.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,480
Because the emotions in that movie were joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and then like

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
that feeling you get when you have a pee that you've held in for a while and it feels so

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,320
good and that one was voiced by Martin Short who accepted the award last night on behalf

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,360
of Pixar.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
And pissed on the entire front row.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,480
I thought his yellow tuckles was a nice touch. That's what you can expect from a true professional

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,600
entertainer. I also, I really appreciated how he made sure to thank Pissar. He like said

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Pixar but he worked piss into it.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,560
I thought that was a nice touch too.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,960
And then John Lasseter was like finally somebody gets it. Finally some recognition for my good

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,920
waterworks.

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,200
My other favorite category of the MTV Movie Awards is best dog humping someone's leg while

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,240
someone else looks on like yeah. That was Randy Quaid again.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,400
That was Randy Quaid again for his performance in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,320
That's like 20 years running.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,640
20 years running. Yeah. Such a huge gift for him. So, so, so, so happy for him to come

55
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,040
out of. They did have to film it. He was kind of Skyped in from his cave but he looked great

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,720
and he had a really nice tux that he had fashioned out of tar and leaves.

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah and I was really psyched this year that he's gotten some like a lot but for the award

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
for best Randy Quaid impersonator I was psyched to see Dandy Quaid finally get his like get

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,640
get gacked up there because like God knows he's worked for it for so long and it's about

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,920
time that somebody was like Dandy you're doing a fucking great job up there.

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,680
And it was actually a lot like Dave because at a certain point people stopped being able

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
to tell the difference between Randy Quaid and Dandy Quaid.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,200
Actually Dandy Quaid has been working a lot as Randy Quaid and his rate is higher.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Like that's the only way you could get Randy Quaid cheaper.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
My favorite part of when Dandy Quaid was on stage is after he accepted the award and you

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
know there's obviously some co-marketing going on here.

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah.

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,120
But he was like and now that I got the award let me give you all a little sneak peek of

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
what's coming in 2017.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,120
And then there was like a 30 second teaser trailer where just very slowly from black

71
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
emerged the word Dennis.

72
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,200
Yeah.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,520
And he was like that's how we're doing it.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,240
And there were fireworks and stuff shooting out and Dennis Quaid stood up like hell yeah

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
and I don't know why he was there.

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
He doesn't understand.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,760
He's about his career is almost over because once Dandy Quaid is in the mix like you're

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
different you are defunct.

79
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
You got assimilated.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Hold on Griffin I hate to disagree with you but I think that capitalism-

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
You love to disagree with me more than anything in the world.

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
That's your favorite fucking thing in the world.

83
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
I think that competition will breed a better Quaid.

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,160
You know what I mean.

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
I think maybe the problem is Dennis has been resting on those laurels for too long.

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,760
He's been sitting around on his laurels and he's grown fat and happy.

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,320
And now we need to get like I can't think of a good pun name from Dennis but it will

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
happen.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
Dandy will definitely think of it.

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
And then we're going to get a better breed of Quaid from the competition.

91
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
It'll be the Quadiest Quaid.

92
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,560
It's the Quaid arms race.

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
It's like it's like yeah.

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah.

95
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,800
So this is an advice show as I'm sure you guessed.

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,040
And what we do on this show is we take advice-

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Menace?

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Is it Menace Quaid?

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,800
No.

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,520
No that's not it.

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,800
Menace Quaid.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,840
I'll keep working on it.

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,080
Menace, his son.

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,520
Listen.

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,560
Penace?

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
We've done this 297 times believe it or not.

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
And this is the 298th time we've done it.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,640
And we're going to do it at least 300 more times.

109
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,200
Did you know that-

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,920
Let's just get going.

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Wait just a real quick fun fact.

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
Fun my bim bam McRoy family factoid.

113
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
You can color this in on the back of your cracker barrel menu.

114
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,600
Because did you know that there's a bonus Quaid?

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
I did not know that.

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,640
There's a real Quaid and he's a half-brother to Dennis and Randy.

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
Bonus Quaid is what I call him.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
His real name is not much better.

119
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
It's actually Buddy Quaid.

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
And that's a true fact.

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,120
That's a true fact.

122
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
He's 41 years old.

123
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,880
He lives in Houston, Texas.

124
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,920
I could hop over there and say hi to Buddy Quaid.

125
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,000
I bet he's not verified on Twitter either.

126
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,680
Brothers.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
Do you know what today is?

128
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
Actually what I thought everyone's going to point out.

129
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
What's that?

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
It's April 11th, 2016.

131
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Oh shit.

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
That means that today is the six year anniversary of my brother,

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
my brother, me, which is what our intro is about.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,840
Can I just say, can I just say six years and we're almost at 300 episodes.

135
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,920
That's a fucking good track record fans out there listening.

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,640
That's a solid 50 episodes a year.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah.

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah.

139
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
That's a really great average.

140
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,640
It's also important that I point out that Randy Quaid has a sister named Brandy Quaid.

141
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
That's also true.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,080
No.

143
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,240
Yeah.

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,760
There's a Brandy Quaid out there.

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
Is there a Denise Quaid?

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
No, that would be funny though.

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,240
That would be funny.

148
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
A Randy with an I.

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay.

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
Listen, I live in a small apartment complex.

151
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,640
We recently got some, I'm always nervous joking about Randy Quaid because I'm worried, you know?

152
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,280
Oh yeah.

153
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,520
Yeah.

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
You say, Justin, Justin, Justin, say no more.

155
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
I think we all get it.

156
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,640
Yeah, I usually check the time between recording and publish and run some stats.

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Like, I don't know.

158
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't know.

159
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,240
I live in and manage a small apartment complex.

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
We recently got some new tenants downstairs.

161
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,360
They seem like a lovely couple with little to no baggage.

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Well, yesterday I got a text from them asking if we could share our wifi with them as they move in.

163
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,160
They, you gave your number to them that quick?

164
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,280
That seems a little wild to me.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,440
Well, they manage the apartment complex.

166
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
So they're like the super manager thing.

167
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,600
Thank you, Travis.

168
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,720
They said they'd be willing to pay for their use of the bill until they get their own service.

169
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,360
I trust they aren't a husband and wife duo of hackers looking for some sweet ISP to siphon.

170
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,720
But that doesn't mean I have to give up my wifi that just anybody does it.

171
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,680
Should I bite the bullet, be neighborly and give them access?

172
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
Are they coveting their neighbor's wifi?

173
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
That's from Gmail.

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,000
This is unthinkable.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,520
This is completely unconscionable, unthinkable and unforgivable.

176
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,760
It's unforgivable that they've even asked for it.

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Because guess what?

178
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
It's 2016, we live on the web now.

179
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,520
I have two virtual reality helmets in my house.

180
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,120
I have one and a half feet in the virtual world now.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,720
And I only have like two little toes is still in the meat space.

182
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
I am a virtual, I'm for all intents and purposes, a virtual being.

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
I've converted all my money over to Bitcoin so the fucking tax man can't get his fucking

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
grubby hands on it anymore.

185
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,480
And you have just been like, these people, essentially, if they asked me this, they'd

186
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
be like, hey Griffin, can we have unfettered access to all your shit?

187
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
Can we have unfettered access to your Bitcoin?

188
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Can we show up naked in your virtual danger room?

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
We live in a world in which when I moved to LA for a month, I was able to power the wifi

190
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
of my computer through the cell service of my phone.

191
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
Like this is Star Trek shit.

192
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
Like I know like this.

193
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,120
No, like this, they don't need to borrow a cup of sugar.

194
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Like they need to borrow a cup of your social security number.

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
And also they're going to get deep into your fucking VR presence and they're going to get

196
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
in your face when you least expect it.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
And then if you die, if you die in virtual reality, you die in real life.

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,440
That's true.

199
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
The first thing I thought when I read this question is do it and then just change your

200
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
password on your wifi once.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
But but that's the practical answer.

202
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:36,240
And the real answer is I would rather share my clothes with someone than I would my wifi.

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,800
Imagine it.

204
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
Try to imagine in the future.

205
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

206
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm so sorry.

207
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,880
My wifi.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Got it.

209
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,240
Perfect.

210
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
Imagine it's like try to look in the future a little bit.

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
You hear a knock on the door, knock, knock, knock.

212
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,120
They open it up.

213
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,080
It's the hyper cops arriving at the scene of the crime.

214
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,840
Now, hyper cops, cops, of course, in this case is an acronym for cyber operatives,

215
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
policing, cyberspace with an S.

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,520
And they show up and they're like, so just to be clear here,

217
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,360
just to be clear, Mr.

218
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
Paulson, you're telling me that you gave them access to your wifi signal.

219
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,280
And if a hyper cop-

220
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,720
That makes sense.

222
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Just one more question.

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
One more question.

224
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
How did you hack into the US Treasury Department?

225
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,960
Like you're you are culpable.

226
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,480
And if you say you opened the gates to them, you are you are basically like type.

227
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,520
They're typing with your hands, basically, is what I'm saying.

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Like no cop is ever going to believe that you just gave someone access to your wifi

229
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,960
and you weren't in on it.

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Like, why would you do that if you weren't also hacking the WhiteHouse.gov site?

231
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
Is that where they keep all the secrets?

232
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes, Travis.

233
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
That's where they keep the secrets, yeah.

234
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
I think you can set up guest networks.

235
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Next question.

236
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
Yeah, but even then, they're going to have probably the same ISP.

237
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
I'm not going to risk anything because I'm pretty sure if somebody can-

238
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,960
That's true.

239
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
If somebody connects to your wifi account,

240
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,080
then I'm pretty sure they're just like five to six clicks away from being able to like scope

241
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
your zone through your webcam.

242
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,960
Definitely.

243
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
That's probably true.

244
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,400
And also like how long, like two, three weeks tops,

245
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,680
they got to go without wifi before they get that shit set up.

246
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
Like, they have smartphones.

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,640
It's 2016.

248
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,080
If they're worried enough about wifi to contact their super about it

249
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,280
and ask if they can use yours, they have smartphones.

250
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,400
Think about this from the other perspective though.

251
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,480
Imagine you're these tenants and you ask your landlord if you could use their wifi

252
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,120
and they're like, uh, absolutely not.

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,600
No.

254
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
You are going to think some dark shit is occurring there.

255
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
No, this is all you say, Juice.

256
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,040
You just say, you know, actually our wifi is not that fat.

257
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Like we pay, we don't have very fast wifi.

258
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,760
So like we don't really have the bandwidth to spare.

259
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
And you kind of shrug your shoulders and kind of chuckle your own joke

260
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
and then just close the door.

261
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,920
Also, just one other thing.

262
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,680
We sell bullets full of heroin on the dark web and it's cool

263
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
because then you can do like one of two illegal things with it if you want.

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
So you can actually shoot people, kill them and make them addicted to heroin.

265
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,960
Get real fucking high.

266
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,760
Can you imagine like moving into a place and being like checklist,

267
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,600
like move in number two, ask other person in building if you could use their wifi.

268
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
That's like, I would never do that.

269
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,360
Never.

270
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,240
Well, you have, I mean, all three of us have like pretty severe social anxiety

271
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
that would prevent us from even like approaching a subject like that.

272
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,920
Well, not everybody's, you know, wired like us.

273
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,360
I guess that's true.

274
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,760
They're mostly wireless.

275
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm just saying I'm in the fucking virtual zone right now.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
They're mostly wireless because it's wifi.

277
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,160
No, I heard.

278
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
Which means wireless fidelity, I think.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
We get tweets all the fucking time from people like,

280
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,960
you missed this great joke from Travis.

281
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,200
I want to go ahead and put my flag in this one and go ahead and say,

282
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
didn't miss it.

283
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,120
Just did not appreciate it.

284
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Did not enjoy it.

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,760
They should remake High Fidelity and call it Why Fidelity.

286
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,840
I would watch that movie where he runs like just a little like really hipster internet shop.

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
Cyber coffee shop.

288
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
That one's got me busting a gut.

289
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,600
I only I only want to if it's if you're not listening to flack files,

290
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
then hi, it's me, Jack Flack.

291
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,120
It's pronounced gift, you idiot.

292
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I made you a spot a fly playlist.

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,440
Here's the top five ways to get your girlfriend back.

294
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,360
I only play EverQuest on an ancient RP server that I run out of my listen.

295
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
Listen.

296
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,160
Yeah.

297
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Do you want me to read a Yahoo?

298
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, yeah.

299
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,280
I guess we can.

300
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
What do you want to do?

301
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
What do you guys want to do?

302
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
I'm going to read this six years.

303
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
I'm going to read this one.

304
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,520
And as just as a little six year present to myself.

305
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,000
It's sent in by Yajur Jujur Davenport.

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,320
Thank you.

307
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
Drew in the game.

308
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
Six years running probably.

309
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I forget when he came in the game, but it's pretty early in there.

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

311
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,480
Please load.

312
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
Please, please, please, please, God.

313
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Please, God, load.

314
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,960
Nope.

315
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Not going to load.

316
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,640
Someone's using your Wi-Fi.

317
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Don't even joke about that.

318
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Muffin says, I need some facts on Mario Lopez.

319
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Help, please.

320
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,440
I need a lot of basic facts about Mario Lopez stared on Saved by the Belt.

321
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,400
Please help.

322
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,680
Some questions.

323
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
One, family background, like the origin.

324
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
Two, biography of him.

325
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
The second point is literally everything.

326
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
Literally all the information.

327
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,840
Literally all the information that exists of him.

328
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,880
Three, birth date.

329
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Four, where he was born.

330
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
Five, where he lives and any others you can think of.

331
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
And if you may, can you please include the information on where you found him?

332
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,560
Thank you so much.

333
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,360
This is a person that like not only knows the internet exists, but uses Yahoo Answers,

334
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,400
but doesn't use the internet to just like Google like Mario Lopez.

335
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,880
Okay, but in their defense, Mario Lopez keeps a pretty fucking low profile, doesn't he?

336
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,320
He works hard to keep his name off that front page of Google.

337
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,760
I mean, there are a few.

338
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Maybe they work in a Mario Lopez free workplace.

339
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
Oh, that would be the worst.

340
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,960
50 interesting facts about Mario Lopez.

341
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,920
Well, let's, I think.

342
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,080
Everybody fucking strap in.

343
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,680
He's reading all 50.

344
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,520
Well, he was born on October 10th, 1973.

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,360
He's a baby.

346
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,640
I was going to say he's way older than I thought.

347
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
He looks perfect.

348
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,200
He was born with three dicks.

349
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,120
Whoa, these facts are crazy, Travis.

350
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm also reading them.

351
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
Definitely the same ones you were reading.

352
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,840
According to Mario Lopez, his first kiss was with Fergie when they were both on Kids Incorporated.

353
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
Here's just the next fact in the same list.

354
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
According to Mario Lopez, he's the only man to ever have two first kisses.

355
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
Sorry, I misread it there in the middle, but that's weird.

356
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,480
How do you have two first kisses?

357
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,160
My first kiss was Mario and Lopez and Fergie watching Kids Incorporated,

358
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
and I was kissing the TV screen.

359
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
It was both of them.

360
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,200
That's fun.

361
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
That's a fun kind of thing, because it didn't happen.

362
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
But this is kind of a fun thing to say, isn't it?

363
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
It's kind of just silly.

364
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,680
If you imagine kissing the TV and it's the two of them,

365
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,120
it's kind of playing off what Travis said.

366
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
It's kind of a silly thing to say.

367
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,560
It's like a silly little guy.

368
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
Number 14.

369
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,920
Mario Lopez has a sandwich named after him at the Quiznos in Long Beach.

370
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
It's a turkey club.

371
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Now hold on.

372
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
You can't just call a turkey club the Mario Lopez.

373
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,360
Yeah, that's not...

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
It's already got a name.

375
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,560
A turkey club.

376
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,760
This is my signature sandwich, the peanut butter and Justin.

377
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
It's peanut butter and jelly.

378
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Wouldn't it be great if Mario Lopez had never been in that Quiznos

379
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,040
and it was just an aspirational naming of a sandwich?

380
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,080
Like, he'll come once he finds out about the Mario Lopez.

381
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm reading here that the character of Super Mario is named after Mario Lopez,

382
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,520
which is weird.

383
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm not exactly sure how...

384
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,000
Was Shigeru Miyamoto a big fan of Stay by the Bell?

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Maybe.

386
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,160
It would explain a lot, wouldn't it?

387
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Mario has an impressive physique and he says he never drinks soda.

388
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,920
I love that I had to put that first part in there.

389
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,560
Mario Lopez, he's got a fucking sexy body.

390
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,480
Now you know that because the internet told you that

391
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,560
and you just didn't look at him fucking ever.

392
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,320
You won't catch Mario walking under a ladder.

393
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,560
He's very superstitious.

394
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,840
Like, Mario Lopez has like swung Tarzan-like vine to vine

395
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,080
from Kids Incorporated to Stay by the Bell

396
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
to fucking doing whatever he wants on TV

397
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
and being basically everywhere and looking amazing

398
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
despite the fact that he's 73 years old.

399
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
Like, I'd be pretty superstitious too.

400
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,280
Like, I will do whatever it takes to not upset the karmic apple cart

401
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
that I'm apparently riding an eye in.

402
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,680
Lopez once admitted to having sex on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland.

403
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,800
That's a long, this is a quote, that's a long ride, by the way.

404
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
It's very dark.

405
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,320
Hopefully I'll get the raft named after me.

406
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,520
Hey dog, I've been on Pirates of the Caribbean

407
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,040
and like, it's pretty well lit and full of kids, you monster.

408
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not that long either.

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
You're a fucking monster.

410
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,520
You have to go, like, your foreplay has to just basically be the part

411
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,240
where they're like, get in, get in the boat.

412
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,840
And you're sitting on, oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.

413
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,400
Oh, uh oh.

414
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,120
Mario Lopez, you're a fun guy.

415
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,560
41, he loves coffee and drinks it black.

416
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,240
42, not surprisingly, his favorite ice cream flavor is coffee.

417
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
That really could have been, they started to get,

418
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
they just wanted to get to 50, huh?

419
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah, they had 49 and they were like, oh shit.

420
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:10,960
Shit.

421
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,920
They were trying to beat the top 40 facts article

422
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,640
on the internet about Mario Lopez.

423
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
They probably cribbed a bunch of those too

424
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
and then they just added 10 about coffee on there.

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
Okay, wait, hold on.

426
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll Google Mario.

427
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,480
Number 48, Mario Lopez wasn't on Saved by the Bell.

428
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,360
Hey.

429
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
Mario Lopez dick length.

430
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Mario penis size.

431
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,440
Can we not?

432
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Can we not?

433
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,160
And his big dick.

434
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
Mario Lopez nude.

435
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,080
Where are these?

436
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,640
What are you doing?

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
Is Mario Lopez circumcised?

438
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Travis, what are you doing?

439
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,880
What?

440
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,840
What are you doing, Travis?

441
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm just trying to get all the Mario Lopez facts

442
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,680
that this person craves.

443
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm Googling Mario Lopez feet.

444
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,360
Sorry, guys.

445
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
See, Justin, you're part of the problem.

446
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
What do you think his next big project will be?

447
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,520
Okay, if you were Mario Lopez, right?

448
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,800
And you had that Lopez heat, what would you do with it?

449
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Well, that's a great question, Travis.

450
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:15,920
Me?

451
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
A restaurant for dogs.

452
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Okay.

453
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
And yeah, no, that makes sense.

454
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
No humans allowed here.

455
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Oh, and I call it Gone to the Dogs.

456
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,600
I might just do that.

457
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
A Mario Lopez joint.

458
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
Yeah.

459
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:42,320
You wouldn't try to get something even Lopez adjacent in there?

460
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,640
Nope.

461
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,240
All the waiters will be dressed like Mario Lopez.

462
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,520
Listeners, if you're wondering why the last 30 seconds of the show has gotten a little laggy,

463
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,600
that's the sound of all of us trying to come up with some sort of dog-related pun

464
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,040
for a restaurant starring Mario Lopez's Caters to Dogs.

465
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,160
We have, as you can tell so far, been unsuccessful.

466
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
Lopez?

467
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,560
In this effort.

468
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
Is there Lopez?

469
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,040
Mario Lopez.

470
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,480
Gone to the Dogs.

471
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
This is pretty good.

472
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
That's his pet story.

473
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,200
Gone to the Dogs 2, Mario Lopez.

474
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Sequel to my last joint.

475
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, it's like how Bill Murray made like a Caddyshack restaurant that was like all golf themed.

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,760
Mario Lopez, his mistake was he made the dog themed restaurant first

477
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,160
and then he spun that off into the movie Mario Lopez.

478
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,040
What if Mario Lopez had been a dog, the movie, based on the restaurant?

479
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,680
I don't think this needle is going to get threaded, gang.

480
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,040
Nope.

481
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,600
Well, listen, hey, we had a good effort and-

482
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
Hello, everybody.

483
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
It's me, Socrates, the inventor of jokes.

484
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,160
And I'm here to congratulate you on finding the impossible joke.

485
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,920
The joke that can't be told.

486
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,680
Oh, I knew we'd just- it only took us six years.

487
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,040
Thanks, Socrates.

488
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Thanks for letting us know now.

489
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,840
You've worked hard.

490
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,520
You found a lot of difficult concoctions over these past six years,

491
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,560
but you found the two subjects that cannot be combined to create humor out of it.

492
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,520
I'm Socrates.

493
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
You can keep trying, but you're only wasting your time and the listeners time.

494
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,400
If you're a listener right here and you are probably have already cooked up two or three hum diggers,

495
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
do not fucking-

496
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,920
No, I'm telling you, don't even tweet those shits.

497
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,560
They suck.

498
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm telling you, I'm Socrates.

499
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,040
Now, Socrates, did you discover the same combination during your time?

500
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,160
Is that how you know that there's nothing but darkness on this path?

501
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,480
I did.

502
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,520
I looked into the crystal lens.

503
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,840
I looked into the crystal lens and I saw Mario Lopez.

504
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,680
And I was like, yes, yes, yes.

505
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,120
Got a hand up under that toga, if you know what I mean.

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
I masturbated to the crystal.

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,640
And then I was like, what if he owned a restaurant for dogs?

508
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,560
And everyone thought that was so whimsical.

509
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,880
And they were all perched on the edge of their seats because I was performing at the Apollo.

510
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,640
It was a different Apollo.

511
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,160
It was like for the god.

512
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,640
And anyway, I just couldn't do it.

513
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
Just couldn't get, couldn't-

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
Is that why you got poisoned?

515
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,720
Sorry?

516
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
Is that why you got poisoned?

517
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,880
Was that you?

518
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Yeah, that was me.

519
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
They killed me right there on the spot.

520
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
And that's where the term to die on stage came from.

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
But I died happy, didn't I?

522
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
Looking at Mario Lopez.

523
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,840
So wait, you're looking at it.

524
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Let me get this straight.

525
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,160
You're looking at a lens of Mario Lopez in front of people beating it.

526
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
The crystal lens.

527
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,760
You were already on some fucking Andy Kaufman experimental comedy shit, huh?

528
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,080
Bros, this was like either Rome or Greece.

529
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm not sure sort of when I operated.

530
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,160
But anyway, yeah, that's like sort of common procedure.

531
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,360
You're not enjoying a good sporting event or a good joke or a wedding or a bar mitzvah.

532
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
Nope, we probably didn't have those back then.

533
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,880
But anyway, yeah, I was having myself a good old toga tongue.

534
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,440
That's why you had the togas in the first place, right?

535
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,560
Yes!

536
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,440
Now you're getting it.

537
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,280
Am I?

538
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,780
Am I?

539
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
Well, Socrates, thank you so much for coming by and saving us the trouble.

540
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
We would have just kept bashing our heads against this thing.

541
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,680
Yeah, nobody wants to hear that.

542
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm actually speaking to you through the crystal now.

543
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
Before I died.

544
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh shit, that's a paradox.

545
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
Oh shit!

546
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,440
That's weird.

547
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,400
His apparition just like deleted itself from-

548
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,040
That was weird.

549
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Just like barkio Lopez?

550
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
Is that like a thing?

551
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,200
Is that-

552
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,700
No.

553
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey, I'm back!

554
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,600
Oh shit!

555
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Oh my god!

556
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Oh my god! All my hypotheses!

557
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,840
They're ruined!

558
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
This changes everything!

559
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,720
Just barkio Lopez?

560
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,560
We're gonna enter into like universe B.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
All right, well, next question.

562
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,880
Here it comes.

563
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Man, I googled so many things in the last five minutes.

564
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
I need to close them before the FBI sweeps in.

565
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,880
I mean, I googled when will Mario Lopez die?

566
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
And I feel like that put me on a very short watch list.

567
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,200
It's just me and Mark Paul Gosler.

568
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,440
Okay, I live it.

569
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,280
Okay, my boyfriend and I go out on a very regular basis.

570
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,680
So we spend a decent amount of time in the car together.

571
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,560
I like to listen to music during transit and I love to sing along to songs.

572
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
My boyfriend will constantly ask me a question or try to talk to me

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
in the middle of a song I love to jam to.

574
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
I've told him I find this frustrating, but he still does it.

575
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,680
Am I wrong to want him to wait until the end of a song for a chat?

576
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,280
And that's cranky co-pilot.

577
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,840
This is the weirdest.

578
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,120
I'm imagining like me and one of you guys in the car

579
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,040
and just like one week just came on and I'm like,

580
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,680
time to show off my rap skills.

581
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Chickity China, the Chinese.

582
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,960
And then like one of you is like,

583
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,120
hey, did you see the new Star Wars trailer?

584
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,920
Like in the middle,

585
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,720
like while I'm in the middle of busting out those fucking raps,

586
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
do you know how angry I'd be?

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Car singing is the most intimate personal like thing

588
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,560
you could possibly do that doesn't involve a toga.

589
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,440
And I don't know why you would do that with another person in the car.

590
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,320
There are two reasons.

591
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
It's simply not done.

592
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,600
There are two reasons.

593
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
The center will not hold.

594
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
The two reasons are one for comic effect.

595
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
Like you saying very like way too intensely to someone

596
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
or you saying the words wrong on purpose.

597
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
Like that's pretty funny.

598
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,280
Jesus, we are just putting on a fucking workshop today, aren't we boys?

599
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,880
We're just putting on a fucking laugh clinic.

600
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,160
For example, my favorite one to do it for is that one song about like,

601
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,920
cause I like you, I like you.

602
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,520
But instead I sing, put your makeup on, take it off,

603
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
put it on again, try again.

604
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
Now some more, a little more makeup.

605
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,240
Okay, that's great.

606
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
And it's pretty funny.

607
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,920
Yeah, I bet it would be if I knew like what the fuck you were talking about.

608
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,160
I believe it's Colby Callie.

609
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,840
And then the other reason is if it is a musical number that is a duet.

610
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:19,840
So maybe your boyfriend doesn't get that he's supposed to join you in on the song.

611
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
So what you need to do is stop and throw it off to him

612
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,160
and just be like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

613
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,960
Now you!

614
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,560
And like give him like the two points, throw it off to him

615
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,720
and get him involved in the song.

616
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,680
You could sing like you're just mid-island in the stream

617
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,000
and you're just like, and ladies and gentlemen,

618
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
please welcome to the stage of the Sahara, Mr. Dillon.

619
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,880
And then just wait for Dylan to pick it up.

620
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,680
That would be aw-

621
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,840
If someone did it to me, I would feel so cool for like five seconds.

622
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
That it took you to realize you don't know the lyrics.

623
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,440
Yeah, nobody knows any of the fucking words.

624
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
Islands in the stream.

625
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
The stream.

626
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
That is what you are.

627
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,480
That is what you are.

628
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,880
Is that right?

629
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,440
Chasing waterfalls.

630
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't actually-

631
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
I can't actually-

632
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
Like a superstar.

633
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
And we're fishing now.

634
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,920
Come away with me to the island island stream.

635
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
That's actually what most people don't know,

636
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
is they're actually concurrent lyrics to islands in the stream.

637
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,000
Both of us are correct.

638
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I wish I'd been with Jimmy Buff the first time

639
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
we heard that fucking song.

640
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,960
And he was like-

641
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,840
Motherfucker!

642
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,560
What are you, why?

643
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,760
Why, Justin?

644
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
Like how did I not write this?

645
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,680
He doesn't seem, and now island definitely,

646
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,680
but he doesn't seem like a stream based performer to me.

647
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,840
Like islands in the bay.

648
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,400
Yeah, he doesn't like bodies of water that are landlocked.

649
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,720
Yeah.

650
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,440
Nobody knows that.

651
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't, I think, I gotta be honest.

652
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,920
I hate to like, I just think it's kind of rude.

653
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,120
I think it's a little rude.

654
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,280
To sing or to interrupt the song?

655
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,840
To sing with somebody else in the car

656
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
when they're trying to like,

657
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,080
you're in a relationship with somebody,

658
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,840
no one's ever been like,

659
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
listen, I knew the day I wanted to marry you

660
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,920
is because I never wanted to hear SWV's week,

661
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,440
that's Sisters of Voices.

662
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,720
I never wanted to hear that without you on the track.

663
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,520
And that's how I knew,

664
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
like you get together with somebody

665
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,320
so you can like talk to them and spend time with them.

666
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,640
And if like you're both singing a song that you like,

667
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,360
that's one thing.

668
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,560
But like, if you're just putting on a little personal concert

669
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
for somebody who's trying to operate a motor vehicle,

670
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,520
like how would you feel if like mid concert,

671
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
they just slipped earbuds in their ears

672
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
that they started listening to a podcast?

673
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
Like that'd be pretty savage.

674
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,400
That's kind of what you're doing to them.

675
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,480
This question asker is definitely asking,

676
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,320
like has asked the boyfriend not to do it anymore.

677
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,760
Oh, then you just seem to give indicates,

678
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,040
song comes on, you crank it up,

679
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,840
you look at him and go,

680
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm gonna sing now, talk to me after the song.

681
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,280
And you just go, communication just right there.

682
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,720
What is he supposed to do?

683
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
What does he do for the next three minutes?

684
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,800
It listens and enjoys, listens and enjoys.

685
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,840
Claps like a 10 year old, 15th century Lord.

686
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,320
Just like, yeah, it stands for me, Jester.

687
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,040
That's what you look for in any partner.

688
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,240
I think the ability to enjoy you in a childlike manner.

689
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,360
I can see a situation where I would be the singer

690
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,720
and I would get worried

691
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,160
about their non-participation in the song.

692
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,320
And like, if John Michael Montgomery's

693
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,400
sold the Grunty County auction came on,

694
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,040
and then I, of course, I'm gonna.

695
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,280
Hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

696
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,800
Give me a sign, I'll do anything.

697
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Of course I'm gonna like.

698
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,640
I thought we were gonna burn it down.

699
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Oh, yeah.

700
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
We've done this six years, have we not earned?

701
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,320
One fucking job.

702
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,280
I went down to the Grunty County auction.

703
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,960
I saw something I just had to have.

704
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,400
I can't, we gotta pay Bryce.

705
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,200
My mind told me I should proceed with caution,

706
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
but my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that.

707
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
He did a lot of research into auctions.

708
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
I said, hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

709
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Oh, that's good, no, I'm definitely not gonna sink you guys.

710
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,760
So this is gonna be like, oh, good, good, good.

711
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,640
I've never seen anyone, never seen anyone looking so,

712
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
never seen any, never seen anyone, never seen,

713
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,720
never seen any, never seen.

714
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,840
We're just gonna duplicate it so there's 19 of us.

715
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
All just different parts of the song.

716
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
It's a round.

717
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,920
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

718
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Give me a little sign, gotta have her,

719
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
she's one of a kind, about to bid my heart goodbye.

720
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,320
Going twice, I'm sold to the lady in the, give me a sign.

721
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,320
That's what you guys fucking sound like.

722
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
She said, I don't know, I think you were just.

723
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, I went down to the Grundy County, give me a sign.

724
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,800
That's you guys doing a little live remix.

725
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
Should I get my guitar?

726
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,360
Let me grab my guitar.

727
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
No, no, no, hey, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice.

728
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,480
Real quick, juice, real quick, before you do that.

729
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,860
Yeah.

730
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
Do you guys want a different yahoo?

731
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
Should we go to the Money Zone?

732
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,840
Money Zone, and here's an instrumental musical vocal

733
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,720
transition into the Money Zone.

734
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,400
It's the Grundy County Auction by us.

735
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,520
We recorded it afterwards in a professional studio,

736
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,200
and it sounds really good,

737
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,120
and I'm gonna play for you right now.

738
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,480
You wear underwear every single day.

739
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,440
On my butt, that's true.

740
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,640
Well, hold on, maybe you do, maybe you don't.

741
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
No, you probably do.

742
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,160
Statistically, you do.

743
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,480
Sometimes I wear, sometimes if there's a bad storm outside,

744
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
I'll wear a thunder wear.

745
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,800
Nice.

746
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,760
When you're wearing a suit-

747
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,040
Sometimes, if I'm very curious, I'll wear wonder wear.

748
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,440
If I'm feeling really religious, nunder wear.

749
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,160
That's good.

750
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,120
If I'm feeling like making some word jokes, punder wear.

751
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,760
Okay, so-

752
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
If it's the first day of the work week, munder wear.

753
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,080
I'm not gonna let you motherfuckers Dan McCoy me

754
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,440
through this advertising break.

755
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,200
You're just gonna have to just do yourself.

756
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
I feel like I've got two more.

757
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,640
If I'm in middle school-

758
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,320
Fine, I'm over here, I'm done, I'm out.

759
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,720
If I'm in middle school,

760
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
and I see something even remotely sexy, cunder wear.

761
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,120
Nice, okay.

762
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,640
If I'm planning on a day on the beach, sunder wear.

763
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Or, also concurrently,

764
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,080
if I'm planning on ripping things apart, sunder wear.

765
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,840
That's pretty good.

766
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm done.

767
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,520
Oh, if I'm about to go jogging, runder wear.

768
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,400
Okay, so let's do it.

769
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,680
I'm done, done.

770
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,880
Go ahead, go for a juice.

771
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,200
What if you're trying to catch sharks

772
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,280
with putting a lot of blood in the water?

773
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Oh, chumder wear.

774
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,600
There you go.

775
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
Mionis are the most comfortable underwear you can wear.

776
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,680
And that's what this company is dedicated to making.

777
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,560
They're made from sustainably sourced modal.

778
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,800
So, a few years from now,

779
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,280
your children will be able to enjoy watching modals

780
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,560
frolic through the trees.

781
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,640
Used to be to get one pair, you would kill a whole modal.

782
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,840
And you'd only use like 5% of it,

783
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,640
and you'd throw the rest right down into the modal well.

784
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
But they use every part of the modal now.

785
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,480
Yeah.

786
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
Yeah, it's twice as soft as cotton,

787
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
and nothing really describes the fit and feel of these

788
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,040
until you put them on your jinnies yourself.

789
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,800
Shipping is free in the US and Canada,

790
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
and you can save $8 a pair

791
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
with the Mionis subscription plan.

792
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
You can get the subscription or a single pair.

793
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
Either way, you get 20% off your first order

794
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,560
when you go to meundies.com slash my brother.

795
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,040
You're gonna adore these underwear.

796
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,280
So listen, if you wear glasses, sure, we all do.

797
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, the spectacle gentleman.

798
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
If you wear glasses, then you know

799
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
glasses are just an unavoidable part of life.

800
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,960
Try not wearing them.

801
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,920
Just try it.

802
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,560
You can't.

803
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
There are lots of people who like don't,

804
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,720
like they're-

805
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
You have garbage eyes.

806
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
Your eyes are made of garbage and you can't see shit.

807
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
What are you gonna do?

808
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,080
Go to some box glasses store and pay way too much?

809
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,160
No, that would be dumb, and you're not dummy.

810
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
You wear glasses like a smart person.

811
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,640
What you're gonna do is you're gonna go to Warby Parker.

812
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
You're gonna get contemporary prescription glasses

813
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,000
starting at just $95.

814
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,920
Like if you've ever bought glasses before,

815
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,160
you know that that is an amazing price.

816
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
You can get prescription sunglasses

817
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,600
starting at just $175, and that includes the lenses.

818
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Here's how it works.

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,840
They have a home try-on program

820
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,440
where you order five pairs of glasses.

821
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,720
They ship directly to you.

822
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,680
That's for free.

823
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
You try on all the frames.

824
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,920
You get a feel for them.

825
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,880
You actually get to look at them.

826
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
People get to look at you and say, that's great.

827
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
You get five pairs for five days,

828
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
and then you mail back the ones that you don't want.

829
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
You only keep the ones that you want.

830
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,840
It's an amazing system, and it really works.

831
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
You go to warbyparker.com.

832
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,320

or to talk about your Etsy business,

840

842

through his favorite podcast

845
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,120
and you paid money to like have them say,

846
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,800
James, please wake up.

847
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,600

Just go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

849
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,160
Do we have a message this week?

850
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,640
Yeah, I got one for Clementine.

851
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
It's from Aunt Jessica and it says,

852
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,240
welcome to the world.

853
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,920
I want your life to be filled with laughter

854
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,880
so my bim bam greeting seems like a good place to start.

855
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,520
I know your mom was a fan when you were in utero,

856
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,080
so you're already prepared for a world of majestic horses,

857
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,480
haunted dolls, and Garfield monstrosities.

858
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,880
We're all so glad to finally have you here.

859
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,960
So what's up, you cool baby?

860
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
So, I mean, she's probably seven by now,

861
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,560
but gosh, I'm just so happy to have Clementine

862
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,440
here on Earth and in high school.

863
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
I'm just really happy this is here.

864
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,040
So vote Clementine, 2016.

865
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,160
Vote Clementine.

866
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,400
Vote Clementine.

867
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,080
She's a mother of three and she's just doing her best to, okay.

868
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,960
So basically, welcome to the world and also we're sorry.

869
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,920
Yeah, welcome to Earth.

870
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

871
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,800
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

872
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,560
This is gonna be a really fun look

873
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,080
at things that I find curious,

874
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,920
whether it's a menstrual cup,

875
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
it might be the Romanov family,

876
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,160
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

877
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,520
I don't even know, who knows?

878
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

879
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,040
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

880
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,560
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

881
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm gonna be learning the things.

882
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

883
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,840
for you to expand your baby brains with me

884
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,120
and have a super fun time.

885
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,240
So I can't wait to see you

886
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,080
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

887
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
I started a new job and it's been great,

888
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,080
except one of the other employees

889
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,560
have been trying to give me friendly warnings.

890
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,720
Now that's in quotes,

891
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,040
but I thought I implied it with my tone.

892
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,600
You did great.

893
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,400
Now I know how to do my job and no one has complained,

894
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,720
but these warnings have gotten in my head more than once.

895
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,360
Their latest warning just annoyed me.

896
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,400
Quote, try not to get that done early,

897
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,600
so you can get in trouble.

898
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,000
What?

899
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,560
Let me do it like I think this person did it.

900
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,160
Try not to get that done early,

901
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
you can get in trouble.

902
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,160
What the fuck does that mean?

903
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,200
I don't know.

904
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,560
So brothers, how do I deal with a coworker

905
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,000
trying to assert dominance?

906
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
And that's from You're Not My Supervise.

907
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,320
You fucking shank him.

908
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
You fucking shank him right between the second

909
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,880
and third rib.

910
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
Just like give it to him right there.

911
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,400
I wanna, okay.

912
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,160
I side with the question asker here,

913
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,480
but I would pose that it's possible

914
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,640
they're not trying to assert dominance.

915
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,880
Maybe that's 100% how they're coming across,

916
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
but maybe like they consider themselves

917
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,400
a bit of like the welcome wagon for new employees

918
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
who they've really figured out how things work around.

919
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,560
They've been around the block.

920
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,280
They've seen new employees come and go

921
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,560
and they've really got the lowdown

922
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,000
and they wanna help you out,

923
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,520
but it's coming across like,

924
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
well, even as I said it,

925
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
it really does like I know it and you don't,

926
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,240
which is bullshit,

927
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,240
but it might not be consciously as shitty as it could be.

928
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Does that make sense?

929
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,720
Maybe they are on some level trying to help you.

930
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,320
They're just really shitty about it.

931
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,640
Some people actually like,

932
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,680
some people don't have a way of communicating

933
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,280
things about their lives

934
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,320
or like don't have that much interesting stuff in their life

935
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,440
or don't have much of a personality outside of their job.

936
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,400
Like their job is the way that like they define themselves.

937
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,640
So the way that they're trying to make a connection with you

938
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,200
is sharing,

939
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,320
because it's the only thing they know

940
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,440
that you have in common.

941
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,200
So they're trying to connect maybe with,

942
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
I may be being too charitable here,

943
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:00,640
but I've known people who they're so sort of embedded

944
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
in their job that it's really the only thing

945
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,320
they have to talk about.

946
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,200
Jesus, Justin, you don't have to fucking sub tweet me.

947
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm right here.

948
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,320
Yeah, I'm really obsessed with my podcast,

949
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,960
my video output,

950
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,400
but I'm not just one dimensional.

951
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,840
I get out there and do lots of stuff.

952
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,760
I go jet skiing almost every other weekend

953
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,120
just to work on my jumps on the jet ski.

954
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,320
But to be fair Griffin,

955
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,840
now you've talked about it on your podcast.

956
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
So now that is part of your podcast work.

957
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,600
Son of a, oh my God.

958
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
I think this person is trying to be the boss.

959
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,480
And the only way to be the boss is to beat the boss

960
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
and they're not gonna beat,

961
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,120
they're not going to attack their boss.

962
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Do you have some kind of like boss beating strategy guide?

963
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, I posted it in Prima games,

964
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,360
published it and it's also a boss guide

965
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,200
for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

966
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,120
So like, if you follow that,

967
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,800
then you'll be able to also attack your boss

968
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
and win in like a physical fight.

969
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,840
There's a lot of crossover,

970
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
just, you know, use a lightning type weapon.

971
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,520
I think that this is like really shitty.

972
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,120
The way that, it may just be entirely,

973
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,080
I might just be projecting

974
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,680
because of the tone of voice that Justin used

975
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,120
when he said this thing

976
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,520
or the tone of voice Travis used when he said this thing.

977
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,920
Maybe I should direct this aggression right at Travis

978
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,840
and maybe this is more innocuous than it sounded.

979
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,440
But this idea of this person being like,

980
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,680
do you try not to get that done early?

981
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,120
You can get in trouble.

982
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,280
That's some fucking Dorian Gray bullshit.

983
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,520
Is that his name?

984
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,640
Sure, it's also possible that this person

985
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
isn't actually trying to help you.

986
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,000
And by saying shit like, don't get this done early,

987
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I could see a scenario where you get it done early

988
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,480
and the boss is like, well, now I can give you more work

989
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,880
because I know you can get it done on time.

990
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,480
But like, I can't imagine an office scenario

991
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,640
in which you would quote, get in trouble

992
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,920
for completing tasks ahead of time.

993
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,960
We need, what we need, by we, I mean humans,

994
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,160
we need like fighting plumage.

995
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,520
Because like, obviously you can get your body really big

996
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,000
and you can like assert, you can reassert dominance

997
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,160
against them by like just showing them your big muscles

998
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,120
and like sticking out your chest

999
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,680
and making human fighting noises like, come on, come on.

1000
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
That's like our like fight sound.

1001
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,720
But I'm saying like, we need something

1002
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,800
like most frogs have where they like extend

1003
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
their throats out real big.

1004
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
And you know like, oh fuck, I gotta stay away from that frog

1005
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,840
or like birds that like shake their plumage

1006
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,240
to let them know like, if you're feeling froggy

1007
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,520
then fucking jump.

1008
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,720
But we don't have that as humans.

1009
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,480
Are you pitching a scenario in which like you get

1010
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,640
your hackles up and someone's going,

1011
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
oh, leave him alone, he's in a bad mood

1012
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,360
or like literally like someone comes up to you

1013
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,800
and they say something shitty.

1014
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,560
Like you might get in trouble and you're like,

1015
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,240
and they're like, oh shit, it's like a dilophosaurus.

1016
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,840
We need to leave that fucker alone.

1017
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,280
I'm saying humans need neck webbing or something.

1018
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,760
Got it.

1019
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,880
That they can really just like.

1020
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,520
And it's not just for, it's just to scare somebody off.

1021
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,800
You wouldn't use it in a fighting.

1022
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,080
Would it also be for mating?

1023
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

1024
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,760
You shake that in a certain way and it's like, all right.

1025
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,280
What if you keep your fists in satin bags?

1026
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,560
Uh-huh, okay.

1027
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm already up for it.

1028
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,720
Reel me in.

1029
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,760
Satin bags.

1030
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,800
All right, do the satin bags.

1031
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,920
Can you describe the satin bags?

1032
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
Because I really need you to paint me a picture right now.

1033
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,640
Yeah, you have, they're sort of like,

1034
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,800
imagine the crown royal bag with the red satin and you slip them over your fists.

1035
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,280
And on one of them, very decorative, is embroidered the word lucky lefty.

1036
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
Lucky lefty.

1037
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,760
And then on the other one is embroidered the word right boy.

1038
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,800
Is it the same for all people or does everyone have their own customized specific?

1039
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
Same words, custom fonts.

1040
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Okay, all right.

1041
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,560
Web dings, comic sans are popular options.

1042
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,440
So if somebody gets on your case and they're like giving you the business,

1043
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,040
then you just start slipping the satin bags off your fist as if it's time to say like,

1044
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,760
time for work, time to go to work.

1045
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,960
They'll get it from there because there's no reason that you would take them out of the bags.

1046
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,520
Because your fists, I mean, it's all just fists.

1047
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,040
What I love about that, Justin, is you only need to do that once

1048
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,320
to establish what it means when the bags come off.

1049
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,680
It's not like a learned behavior that you would only have to once

1050
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,640
remove the bags and punch someone and put them back on

1051
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,640
before everyone would be like, if he goes for the bag, back away.

1052
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,920
Don't break eye contact.

1053
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,040
Do not smile.

1054
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,640
That's a show of aggression.

1055
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,160
Keep your shoulders hunched.

1056
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,200
Just move away and then turn a corner as quickly as you can.

1057
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,720
This would make a bar fight way more interesting.

1058
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,000
I don't like watching people fight.

1059
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,120
Like, those videos pop up on Facebook and it's like, watch these 12 dudes knock the

1060
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,880
fuck out of each other at a baseball game.

1061
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,360
No, I don't want to watch men get hurt.

1062
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,160
No, thank you.

1063
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,480
But I would watch 12 men standing in a circle very slowly taking bags off their hands going

1064
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,240
like, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1065
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,400
Because it's the drama, it's the build up.

1066
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,840
It's the fucking drama, it's the build up.

1067
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,880
It's the Christmas Eve of the brutal attack.

1068
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,680
You know what would make human fighting so much better?

1069
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,720
So when deers, when male bucks fight, like deer, bucks, they like slam their horns together.

1070
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,920
And sometimes there's a chance that their horns become stuck together.

1071
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,080
And then they just have to kiss.

1072
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,360
That's nature looking out for itself.

1073
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,880
Like, hey, you two are beautiful.

1074
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,680
Don't fight.

1075
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,960
I'm gonna make y'all kiss instead.

1076
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,000
Clink, you're stuck.

1077
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,120
Smooch, smooch, smooch.

1078
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,080
But can you imagine if two like drunk people at a bar were like, we're gonna have to fight

1079
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,720
about this.

1080
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,240
And then they started fighting.

1081
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,160
But then by the end, like their arms were just like stuck together, like hooked together

1082
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,600
in a way that they couldn't get out.

1083
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,880
And they're like, oh, man, now we're both look like dummies.

1084
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,240
Now we're both embarrassed.

1085
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,560
And that smaller person took our drinks and we can't do shit about it.

1086
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,800
I think I like that.

1087
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,040
Something like that does happen, though, in boxing.

1088
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,440
Yeah.

1089
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Sometimes the boxers will get into like, they'll be so exhausted.

1090
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,920
Uh-huh.

1091
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,640
That they'll kiss?

1092
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,280
That they'll like, no, they'll just like wrap each other up and stand there for a second.

1093
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,320
And it's like, it's beautiful because it's both of them saying.

1094
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,960
I want to fight.

1095
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,920
I want to punch you so bad, but I'm so sleepy.

1096
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,120
I want to punch you more.

1097
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,320
But I'm so, one of them just whispers in the other's ear.

1098
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,760
First of all, I am tired.

1099
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,360
I am true of heart.

1100
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,240
And the other one whispers back, you are tired.

1101
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,280
You are true of heart.

1102
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,240
It's like this moment where they're both very human.

1103
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,480
Yeah.

1104
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,960
You know what I mean?

1105
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,720
Like it's very, they're very connected to each other and everything.

1106
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,320
Just the whole thing, you know?

1107
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,040
And then another one gets so angry.

1108
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,280
Yeah.

1109
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,040
That they let themselves become so vulnerable.

1110
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,280
Yeah.

1111
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
Using the energy to finish the fight.

1112
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,480
I think that's why it would be nice if you gave boxers like the chance to ring their

1113
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
own bell when they need a break.

1114
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:52,800
Yeah.

1115
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,280
Like they hug and they're like, do you want to take a break?

1116
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,960
We'll sit down on our stools.

1117
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,200
Someone will cut us and put like a cold quarter on our face or something.

1118
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,800
Or on the flip side, it's just like, I'm just going to stand here and hug

1119
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,920
you and take a nap.

1120
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,000
Because I don't want the man to cut my face anymore.

1121
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,560
And as long as I'm in here, I'm safe from the cutting man.

1122
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,600
You lean against me.

1123
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,720
I lean against you.

1124
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
And neither one of us has to sleep with our heads in the way.

1125
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,920
You know what I mean?

1126
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,400
Hey, man.

1127
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,480
I also am very afraid of the cutting man.

1128
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,960
Oh, good.

1129
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,760
I thought it was just me.

1130
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,160
Nah, dude.

1131
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,800
Just hug me here.

1132
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,760
I'll watch your cutting man.

1133
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,800
You watch my cutting man.

1134
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah.

1135
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,480
That sounds like a good arrangement.

1136
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,160
Please don't make me go back to the cutting man.

1137
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
Should we punch each other more just so they don't like ring the cutting man belt?

1138
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah.

1139
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,520
I guess so.

1140
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,360
Oh, man.

1141
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,800
I'm so sorry.

1142
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,600
I'm so sorry.

1143
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,360
That's what hurts so bad.

1144
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,240
My face is so tender.

1145
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,560
Please.

1146
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,280
I can't get cut.

1147
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,480
You have blunt and he has edged and I'd rather take a blunt hit.

1148
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,680
Please just punch me again.

1149
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,960
I don't want to punch you again.

1150
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,360
If you don't punch me, I have to go back to the cut man.

1151
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,080
Free me.

1152
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,400
Free me from the cut prison with your punch gloves.

1153
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,360
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1154
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,480
I don't want to go over there and I don't want to get my face all cut up to release

1155
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,360
the pressure in there.

1156
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,280
But I also don't want to get punched anymore.

1157
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,960
Do we have any way out of this?

1158
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,840
Can we save face?

1159
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,960
Can we both lay down?

1160
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,360
Do we got any kind of exit strategy out of this so we don't get to have to punch each

1161
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,080
other anymore?

1162
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,120
I'm just sleepy.

1163
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,400
You smell.

1164
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,960
Hey, dog.

1165
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,280
Hey, dog.

1166
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,080
You smell good.

1167
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:17,840
Thank you.

1168
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,560
Boxing is really the story of two guys trying to run away from their individual cut men

1169
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,240
and they just meet each other in the middle.

1170
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,920
It's like, well, I got to go through this guy because he is not altering his course

1171
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,480
whatsoever.

1172
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,960
And if you punch good enough, the referee doesn't make you go back to the punch man,

1173
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,840
to the cut man.

1174
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,040
I think there's some truth to what we're saying though, because every fight by like

1175
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,640
round three through ten, it's just like, not that I've watched that much boxing in

1176
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
my life, but it's just kind of peters out, right?

1177
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,920
And that first round, they go crazy.

1178
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,320
And after that first round, they get into a hug in the second round.

1179
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,000
They're like, hey, dude, I don't know about you.

1180
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,200
I just remembered, I do not like being punched.

1181
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,840
Yeah, me too.

1182
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,160
That's why when you see that like one punch KO on like the first punch of the mat, like

1183
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,960
at first the guy who punched the guy out is like, yeah.

1184
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,880
And he's like, oh, I didn't get myself hardly any break away from the cut man.

1185
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,920
I have to go right back.

1186
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,840
I was literally just there.

1187
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,480
I didn't get, I should have, I should have waited to knock that guy out so I could have

1188
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,880
at least like ten minutes where I wasn't with him.

1189
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,280
Oh, it's kind of sad.

1190
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,520
That's why it's called the beautiful dance for it.

1191
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,880
Do you want to go?

1192
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
Can I give you fucking Kanzayahu real quick?

1193
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,960
Yeah.

1194
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,240
It's by level 9,000.

1195
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,480
You know, you answers user.

1196
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,520
Sally, thank you, Sally, for this question.

1197
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,880
Sally asks, I have to go to a bully's birthday party tomorrow night and I do not know what

1198
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,840
to give them for a gift.

1199
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,120
Can anybody help me with this?

1200
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,400
No details.

1201
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,320
No details, huh?

1202
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,280
Is there not enough fucking, that's a beautiful short story.

1203
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,320
You were invited to, let's say Brock hit Lesnar.

1204
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,800
Brock Lesnar.

1205
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,520
Brock Lesnar.

1206
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,280
I would call him a fucking bully.

1207
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,120
You're invited to Brock Lesnar's birthday party and all Brock does is pick on you while

1208
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,760
you're at school.

1209
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,120
This is like, yeah, we're picturing this like a Muppet Babies, but it was like MMA and boxers.

1210
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,800
It's WWE Babies.

1211
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,600
I was getting there.

1212
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,320
Yeah, wrestling babies, wrestle babies.

1213
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,480
So you're in a wrestle babies situation.

1214
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,800
We've all been there and you're invited to this.

1215
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,640
You don't want to go, but maybe like your mom knows Brock's mom from church and she's

1216
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,520
like, we have to go.

1217
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,160
The Lesnar's, you know, they're in our Bible study.

1218
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,880
We have to go.

1219
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
What do you get, baby Brock?

1220
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,800
I mean, the obvious answer is a Jimmy John's sandwich or a Jimmy John's gift card.

1221
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,960
Is that a Brock Lesnar thing?

1222
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,000
Boy, that would be a fucking funny joke if either of you two knew anything about wrestling.

1223
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,680
I wasn't sure if that was a wrestling thing or just like a bully thing.

1224
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,160
Jimmy John, I'm just going to call him Jimmy John because he wears shorts as Jimmy John's

1225
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,640
on them and he's the only fucking wrestler who's allowed to wear like a logo on a thing

1226
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,320
and it's a fucking Jimmy John's pants and nobody knows why.

1227
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,040
Nobody knows why.

1228
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,080
I don't think he's getting money out of it.

1229
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,840
I think he just like loves that roast beef.

1230
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,680
He loves that hunter.

1231
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,240
Yeah.

1232
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,200
Loves that hunter.

1233
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,200
Maybe you could get him a book.

1234
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,720
I was about to say on not bullying, but what if you went the other way and got him a book

1235
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,000
on how to be a better bully and you were just like, from now on, like, I got your back.

1236
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,840
Like, I like that you're a bully.

1237
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,640
I not only want to support it, I want to make you a better bully.

1238
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,360
So when you bully me, I'm enjoying it too.

1239
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,560
Reverse psychology.

1240
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,440
Until he's like, I can't bully Travis anymore.

1241
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
He enjoys me being a better bully.

1242
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
What am I even doing?

1243
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,040
This is that fucking Hey Arnold, Helga Pataki, like nobody came to your birthday party because

1244
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,160
you're kind of a heel, but I came to it and I didn't want to at first, but now I'm learning

1245
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,800
a lot about you.

1246
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,680
You're learning a lot about me.

1247
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,080
You're still going to fucking bully me come Monday.

1248
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,800
But that Roger Klotz, if we may branch into a different, I like yours too.

1249
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,680
I just want to expand it because maybe we were talking to a little bit of a generational

1250
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,400
gap.

1251
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,360
Roger Klotz, he finds your diary, but he doesn't, he says he doesn't read it when you're afraid

1252
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,640
that he did, but he doesn't.

1253
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,840
And it turns out he's not such a bad guy.

1254
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,000
And then Biden can't sweat your shorts.

1255
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,120
He's a good character.

1256
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,320
And he puts, he puts the puzzle together.

1257
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,640
What?

1258
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,280
Ice cream.

1259
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,240
Cause he's magic.

1260
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:17,920
Wait, hold on.

1261
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,520
And he tries to, he goes to awful waffle you and he leans in close to your ear and he's

1262
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,920
like, I know my dad's a piece of shit too.

1263
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,160
And he lets you up and then you're free to go.

1264
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,720
And then sponge and donkey lips are there.

1265
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,200
And man, a good show.

1266
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,960
Allegra, Allegra pops out that window.

1267
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
She's like, hi, I existed.

1268
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,440
And also Eureka's castle.

1269
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:37,680
Okay.

1270
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,080
So much.

1271
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,960
I got a perfect gift.

1272
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,480
I got a perfect gift.

1273
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,280
Two satin bags for his fists.

1274
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,720
But listen, inside the satin bags.

1275
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,440
Itching powder.

1276
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,720
You got him, you got him, you got him, you got him, you got him, got him, got him, got

1277
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,840
him, got him, got him.

1278
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,240
Got him.

1279
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,440
Well, no, that's actually bad.

1280
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,240
That's actually maybe acid.

1281
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,600
Now his fists are literally itching to punch you.

1282
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,240
Yeah, that's, he's going to be withdrawing them all the time.

1283
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,800
He's going to be an object of living fear.

1284
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,240
Take it one step further, Justin.

1285
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,840
Itching powder, crazy glue around the inside rim.

1286
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,920
So he puts his hands in, itching, can't get the bags off to scratch him, goes crazy.

1287
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,240
Yeah.

1288
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,520
Hey, how are you supposed to work on a computer if you have satin bags over your hands?

1289
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,200
That's why you don't see a lot of bullies in the technical fields.

1290
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,120
That's why.

1291
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,120
That's why.

1292
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,920
I get it now.

1293
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,320
That's why.

1294
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,680
That's the answer.

1295
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,160
Okay, listen.

1296
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,520
I do just want to point out that the top answer on this question is somebody saying I would

1297
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,040
give them a book on bullying.

1298
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,800
So way to go, Travis.

1299
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,680
I did it.

1300
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,240
Or some stupid gag gift, like a roll of duct tape marked with to use over your mouth to

1301
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,440
prevent bullying.

1302
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,600
Really, I would do that in a heartbeat.

1303
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,240
Would you?

1304
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,120
Would you common sense?

1305
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,400
I think you would.

1306
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,560
Because it seems like you should have a funnier thing.

1307
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,080
If you're going to do a thing a bit, you should have a funnier bit.

1308
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,400
You should also not-

1309
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,080
Did you hear my thing about the satin bags?

1310
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,680
You should not use the phrase gag gift to describe something that would literally be

1311
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,120
used to cover someone's mouth.

1312
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,560
Because then that is-

1313
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,440
That's not what that means.

1314
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,200
I know, that's not- you're wrong.

1315
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,400
I want to go back to talk about wrestle babies because I really feel like it's a property

1316
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,360
we could expand on and be pretty rich off of.

1317
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,760
Yeah, I would love to just hear you two say basically anything about wrestling for a minute.

1318
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,480
Today wrestling.

1319
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,080
I don't want to hear any fucking Jake the Snake shit or honky tonk man bullshit.

1320
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,600
I want the current roster.

1321
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,520
Baby Undertaker, he's still in there.

1322
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,400
That's fucking cheating.

1323
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,520
That dude's 50 years old.

1324
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,520
Single H, which is baby Triple H.

1325
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,880
Okay.

1326
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,040
He hasn't earned the other two H's yet.

1327
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,840
That's fine.

1328
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,360
Do you think he would be Vince McBaby?

1329
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,680
Oh, and they would have play pin matches instead of cage matches.

1330
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,800
Okay.

1331
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,600
Heck of a sec.

1332
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,400
What?

1333
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,040
That's mine.

1334
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,480
I just took your thing because it worked here too.

1335
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,080
It's my thing now on this show.

1336
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,360
Hey listen, that's gonna do it for us.

1337
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,960
What about Goldust?

1338
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,520
Goldust, but he's just really little and he can sneak up at you through like toilet pipes.

1339
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,040
Oh God, I just gave myself a shiver.

1340
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,320
Well, birthday shiver.

1341
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,840
Well, anniversary shiver here for six years of podcasting excellence.

1342
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,080
I want to mark this occasion by thanking some folks for some stuff they sent us.

1343
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,640
Meredith and Carl, maybe Colin.

1344
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,720
I'm not real good at these notes here, but they sent us a save the day date.

1345
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,880
Um, Stephanie and Michael-

1346
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,840
Hey McElroy, save the day, Thursday.

1347
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,400
All of them.

1348
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,800
Stephanie and Michael sent us what I've noted here as an STD.

1349
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,640
I'm hoping I mean save the date there.

1350
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,280
And Tim and Mariah invited us to their wedding.

1351
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,520
Apologies to all of you that we didn't make it, but I'm sure it's gonna be a special day

1352
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,080
no matter what.

1353
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,600
Adrian sent us a $2 lottery scratcher.

1354
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,880
Didn't make any money off of that.

1355
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,120
Don't live in that state anyway, so I probably couldn't redeem it.

1356
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,200
Stephanie sent us a thank you note.

1357
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,880
Somebody sent us in a fuck you Ron mug, but there was no information along with that.

1358
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,640
Landon sent us a blizzard puck.

1359
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,360
A Huntington blizzard puck.

1360
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,560
I know, I know.

1361
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,600
We can share custody.

1362
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,880
Someone sent us juggling balls.

1363
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,720
Didn't appreciate that very much at all.

1364
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,240
They didn't have the-

1365
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,680
I have, I want you to know, I've been practicing.

1366
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,520
I also got those 2016.

1367
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,840
I'm gonna learn to juggle and then we'll have a juggler in the family.

1368
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,520
You'll just have to deal with it, dad.

1369
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,200
How many, how many flashes are you up to?

1370
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,320
Like not even one.

1371
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,200
I can't.

1372
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,280
I'm so bad at it, Justin.

1373
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,560
I'll give you some tips later.

1374
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,000
And also the Joyful Fox is the really cool Dr. Who clock, the Joyful Fox design.

1375
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,040
Oh yeah, that was really cool.

1376
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,920
You sent me a picture of that.

1377
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,600
That was, yeah, it was really neat.

1378
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,600
Um, uh, so that's, that's the gifts and I really appreciate everybody.

1379
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,240
P.O. Box 54, Huntington West Virginia, 2576 if you want to send us something.

1380
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,280
Travis has his own box.

1381
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,320
P.O. Box 909, uh, Van Nuys, California, 91408.

1382
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,480
You can find it all on McElroyShows.com.

1383
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,400
There's also like all of our shows and like the contact info and that kind of stuff.

1384
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,240
I want to say that I don't have a P.O. Box because I've sort of evolved beyond,

1385
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,480
um, owning physical possessions.

1386
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,200
But if you just want to think a good thought towards me today.

1387
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,680
Just like think like a positive, warm thought and just send some of that energy in my direction.

1388
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,880
I'd appreciate it.

1389
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,200
All right.

1390
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,240

1394
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,000
Please stop subscribing my box to horse magazines.

1395
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,640
Like I get it, but they still keep, they just keep coming.

1396
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,960
I have three Western Horsemen issues that I get every, I just would rather not.

1397
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,800
I helped Justin clean out his P.O. Box when we were in town for Christmas.

1398
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,320
And no kidding, guys, it's a fucking horse disaster in there.

1399
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,160
And this is not one of those funny things where we're saying don't do it so that more

1400
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,880
people will do it.

1401
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,400
And you're like, well, I'm going to do it.

1402
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,760
It's a waste of paper.

1403
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,520
And like, it's a waste of horse.

1404
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,040
It's a waste of horse information.

1405
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,840
But most importantly, it has become a logistical nightmare.

1406
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:16,880
Nightmare.

1407
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,720
When my boy Tim at the Veterans Memorial Boulevard post office, when I pull up,

1408
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,240
he's like, oh, this fucking guy.

1409
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:29,600
They have literal, they have literal tubs in the back room full of unread horse magazines.

1410
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,760
And it's, it is embarrassing.

1411
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,320
It is embarrassing, but postcards are nice.

1412
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,040
You can do that.

1413
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,760
Postcards are great.

1414
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,360
Unless one of those postcards ends up in one of the fucking folds of the horse magazines

1415
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,920
and we'll never see it because it got tucked away in there and we thought it was like a

1416
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,000
mailer for a second subscription.

1417
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,360
Just saying that the hazards of these horse magazines are unlimited.

1418
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:55,840
Justin, can I just say real quick too, as we near our 300th episode, it's so nice.

1419
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,360
Thank you everybody for listening.

1420
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,360
Like I, I've just every week struck by the fact of like, people still like this, huh?

1421
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,040
That's, that's crazy to me.

1422
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,160
And I'm so humbled by it.

1423
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,720
Thank you very much.

1424
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,800
We'll talk more about it at the 300th episode.

1425
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:16,960
Um, I, I will say I, I have now ended the submission line for the people, like the look

1426
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,280
back retrospective since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me soundbites

1427
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,040
cause I have so many of them and they're so good and I have to start working on it.

1428
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,240
So I can no longer accept new ones, but thank you to everybody who sent one in and hopefully

1429
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,240
I can get that all done in two weeks.

1430
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,520
I want to thank, say thanks to John Roderick in the long winter.

1431
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,240
She used our theme song.

1432
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,320
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1433
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,600
It's fucking great.

1434
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,160
Great album.

1435
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,800
Good to listen to.

1436
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,240
Good to hear with your ears.

1437
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,120
Good to taste.

1438
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,960

I do have a final Yahoo.

1445
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,520
Um, it was sent in by no kidding.

1446
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:08,320
Probably 19 people, 19 different people sent this in over email over Twitter.

1447

Thank you all.

Can anyone tell me how to get young Joseph Stalin hair

1451
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,400

We host the medical history podcast saw bones, a tour of all the weird,

1462
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,000
stupid, terrible, horrifying, hilarious ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

1463
