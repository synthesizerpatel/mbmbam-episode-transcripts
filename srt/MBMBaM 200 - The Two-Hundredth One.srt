1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,760
Inrich, don't you approve? Is that the song you're going with?

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,280
One who's just running around, one who can't move.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Let me throw this out. Let me throw this song out.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Where are the clowns? Okay, now try this song on. Are you ready?

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:20,000
As we go on, we remember all the times we had together.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,960
This is it. I couldn't remember the rest of the song.

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,160
It definitely doesn't spiral off into whatever that Zelda menu music you were just doodling.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,000
That was pop and circumstance, I think. What song would you like to sing, Griffin?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Just when I'd stopped opening doors. Justin has it on the nose.

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,400
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,760
Making my entrance again with my usual flair. Sure of my lies.

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,240
It's a little bit masturbatory, this introduction so far.

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
No one is there. It feels like those episodes of Quantum Leap

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,800
where Scott Bakula would jump into Elvis and be like, just because you wanted to sing.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Losing my timing this late in my career. It says in my writer,

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,320
Donald Bellisario, I get four singing episodes this season.

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
Where are the clowns? Quick.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,080
Big finish. Send in the clowns.

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Oh, fuck it. Don't bother.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,920
They are on fire. I haven't heard the song.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
We're here. The clowns. My brother, my brother and me.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
Don't need to send us in. We're here. Episode 200. It's huge.

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
Can we not play it up like we made all these big grand plans for the old-

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
We have a special guest star. Larry the Cable Guy.

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,120
Hey, hell yeah, get her done. All right, brothers.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Thanks so much for having me. Get her done.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,760
I want to say hello to all them little pygmy children out there.

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
Lord, I apologize. Get her done, data salad.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,040
Yeah, your side. I have been confused.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
We are Hivemind now. We are one of the blue-collar comps

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,640
who are fused into one man. We fell on a big pit of comedy acid

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
and now we're just a big gelatinous blob of country idioms.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Get her done, salad. I'm Larry the Fox High Decker

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,160
and I'm here to tell you that get her done, son.

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Please kill me. Please set me free from-

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,040
I've got seven arms. My mortal pain.

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,880
I'm in a flesh prison, y'all. I'm in a prison of flesh.

42
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,000
I have no mouth, but I must screen get her done.

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,080
Listen, we didn't do- It seems like a good episode to start with.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,600
It seems like it's pretty good so far.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,320
If you wanted to get somebody on board with the show,

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,800
this seems like the one that you would tell them to jump on with.

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,320
Episode 200. We have passed actually last month,

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,840
without comment, our four-year anniversary.

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,920
Oh, wow. 2010 is when this whole crazy journey got started.

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,720
And when will it end, Justin? When will it end?

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
December 12th, 2016, along with all of the rest of creation.

52
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
So mark it down.

53
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
That dude was so close. And by that dude,

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,760
I mean the entire Mayan culture, I guess.

55
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,680
Their whole- Their whole sort of thing.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,240
We're saving the juice for 500. We're not even fucking halfway there.

57
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,880
500? We'll destroy 500. We will have special guests.

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
We will get Billy Crystal.

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
We will have jet packs.

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
We will have jet packs.

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
We'll get Billy Crystal over to our studio with a jet pack.

62
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
I don't know what's more unlikely in that scenario,

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,920
that A, we will somehow get a hold of Billy Crystal.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,040
B, there will be jet packs.

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,480
Or C, that the three of us will somehow pool our resources to have a studio.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,560
I think it's actually most unlikely that we'll stick with this

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
for like another seven years. For another 300 episodes, yeah.

68
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,760
God, I hope not. Oh, God. Don't even say that.

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
I get a little scared just thinking about it.

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
Anyway, this is our Comedy Advice Show.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
My brother, my brother, and me, you're here.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,640
It's gonna be a lot easier to keep track of these

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,080
now that we're starting at 200.

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
It seems like counting has become hard.

75
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
187. Like, what does that even mean?

76
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
What is- What is 187?

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
What is 187? 200. What are numbers?

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
That's a big one.

79
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,240
So let's- Like, we're not gonna do that much different,

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
except just like help you.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
We're gonna check in with some old friends.

82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
We're gonna tell you about some snacks.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
And it's just gonna be like a regular show.

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
So it's gonna be great.

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,320
I hope you like it.

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,680
Hi, brothers.

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
I've been spending the last year or so getting fit and beefy.

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
I got designs drawn up for a couple tattoos that I've wanted for a few years.

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
I've told myself I'd only get them when I finally got my sexy right.

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,320
Now that I'm there, I feel like I might be too old to get my first tattoo.

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm 25.

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
I get the feeling getting your first tattoo is something for rebellious teens

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
or dipshit college kids.

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Did I miss the window or am I good?

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
That's from Hesitant in Houston.

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,920
What kind of world do we live in that at 25,

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,400
someone's worried they're too old to do something?

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,920
To do anything.

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,560
Oh my god.

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
If 25's too old to do anything, that is only exacerbating my panic attack.

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Please.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm 33 years old.

103
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
Please tell me that's not too old to do anything.

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Look at me.

105
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,920
25 got all my shit together.

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,040
Living up here in the adult life in this penthouse.

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,200
My old rotten bones.

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,360
Could stick it up at noon.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Wait, do you have Jack disease?

110
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,200
I didn't ask.

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,120
Do you have Jack Bauer disease?

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
Can I tell you guys something?

113
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,520
I think our advice would be a hundred times better

114
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
if we would stop assuming that everyone who asks us for advice has Jack disease.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,600
But it wouldn't be as applicable to that one person that does.

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,760
Yeah, I mean, one out of every-

117
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,320
No one's talking to me, the one guy with Jack disease.

118
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,120
One out of every hundred people does have progenitals.

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
What if, okay, I'm not talking about the actual disease.

120
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm talking about Jack disease.

121
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
The other thing's a real thing that is not funny.

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,520
No, most diseases are not known for their humor quantity.

123
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
Except for chuckle peas.

124
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,760
And jungle fever.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
Here's my advice.

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
One, two, three, and fuck it.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
Yeah.

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
It's you're 25, you wanna get a tattoo?

129
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
I think 25 is a great time.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
I think I was probably around 25 when I got my first tattoo.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Maybe younger, yes.

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,720
I think, here's the question though.

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,680
If you're a beefy dude, I'm gonna assume that this guy is like thick as shit.

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,920
Not chunky, but like-

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,280
Like Vin Diesel.

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
Like Vin Diesel, but maybe a little bit shorter

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,280
and a little bit thicker and a little bit broader,

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
but it's all muscle mass.

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,440
I'm thinking-

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
You are painting quite the word picture.

141
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm thinking of like the thing from the Fantastic Four.

142
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Lot of ripples and a lot of bulges.

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
And I think when you are that rippled and bulged,

144
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,520
you can't get a Triforce tattoo.

145
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
You have to get some tribal shit on your neck.

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh yeah.

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,360
Yeah.

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,040
You have to get a sleeve of tribal, I think just tribal shit in general.

149
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,040
I think the tribal tattoo industry is built upon the scaffolding of 100 beefy men.

150
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,480
Let me throw this out.

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,120
Tribal tattoo around your bicep, but you only tattoo three quarters of the way around.

152
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,480
And then when people ask why you didn't finish it,

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
you say, oh, it used to touch.

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
And then I started working out.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
That's my extra skin I got.

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,080
Oh, I was just like totally ripping, lifting, crushing, dipping, squatting, potting, jumping,

157
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
and crumping in the gymnasium with a lot of super heavy weights.

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
And I just looked down one day, I was like, oh no, my tattoo got interrupted

159
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,520
by the new skin that showed up with the extra muscles that I built.

160
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,240
Yikes.

161
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
I think tribal is absolutely the way to go.

162
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,280
I think it's got to look like,

163
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,080
it should look like a spiky alien is eating you from the inside, consuming you gradually.

164
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
That's what it should look like.

165
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,440
The dream is that it looks like the Venom suit mid-transformation, right?

166
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Correct.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,840
That's the idea with tribal tattoos.

168
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,480
Where do you get it though?

169
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm a fan of Nex-

170
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Prison.

171
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,020
Okay.

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,560
Wouldn't it be great to get a tribal tattoo while you were working with Greenpeace in a tribe?

173
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
And then when someone's like, oh, fuck a tribal tattoo, be like, yeah, I got this.

174
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah, but then you don't know, maybe the tattoo says Pussy Willow

175
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
and they wouldn't tell you that.

176
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,400
Or even better, you ask for that.

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
Can I get one that says Pussy Willow and it says like hard ass motherfucker

178
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,160
and you're like, damn it.

179
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Oh no, I definitely wanted Pussy Willow.

180
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
I want everyone to know that I am a gentle soul.

181
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
Griffin, how about Yahoo?

182
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,220
Sure.

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm glad we started off our 200th by not helping someone.

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,480
I mean, we told them exactly what kind of tattoos to get and where to get it.

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
So if that's not helping, I don't know what is.

186
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
The fuck it is the best advice you can get.

187
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
You're 25 years old.

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
You want to get a tattoo, get a tattoo.

189
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,560
Yeah.

190
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,200
What do I care?

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,520
You're pretty far from death.

192
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
You got a lot of ball game left to play.

193
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,180
Yeah.

194
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
You're still in early innings, optimistically speaking.

195
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,480
This Yahoo was sent in by Peter Steiner.

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,440
Thank you, Peter.

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:43,040
It's by a Yahoo Answers user who has been deleted from the Tron grid of Yahoo.

198
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,120
Thank you, Peter.

199
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,640
This mystery user asks, what are some hot guy names?

200
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Uh, this is in the section, pregnancy and parenting baby names.

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,480
So they're looking for hot guy names for their baby.

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,960
Okay.

203
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah.

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,080
Do they mean a hot, do they mean popular or names that would be fit a hot guy?

205
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,520
Hunky dude.

206
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
Like, like blaze.

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400
How about this?

208
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,160
Or steel with four L's.

209
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
Additional info.

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,340
Steel.

211
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,840
Steel.

212
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,160
Steel.

213
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,880
Yeah.

214
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,080
Just tell me guy names that sound hot.

215
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
Thanks.

216
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,280
Okay.

217
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,320
That clarifies it.

218
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
It's definitely steel.

219
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,360
I mean, they have a point, right?

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Rachel and I have been watching a bunch of Survivor because they just added a bunch of

221
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
that shit to Hulu.

222
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,960
And I feel like, you know, you don't even need to see the dudes.

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,000
You'll hear of like Noah and you're like, fuck, yeah, that dude's going to look awesome.

224
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,520
That's going to be one awesome looking guy.

225
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,400
Yeah.

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
Or dreams.

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Dreams.

228
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,760
Another one of my favorite Survivor.

229
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
My name is steel dreams.

230
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:14,960
So here's some, these are some suggestions from Yahoo.

231
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:26,080
Fool in the rain says Brody, Jake, Luke, Talon, Spencer, Jackson, Ethan, Heath, Jude.

232
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,560
Matt is usually a hot guy's name.

233
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,880
Matt?

234
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,020
Matt?

235
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
I can write from the top of my head name you five despicable mats.

236
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,280
I could name you five.

237
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,040
That was my favorite cartoon movie.

238
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
Sort of squirrely mats with weird hair.

239
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,080
I don't know.

240
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
What about Matt Mateus?

241
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,080
I don't know who that is.

242
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,480
I don't know.

243
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm just saying like that'd be a way hotter version.

244
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Oh, it's super, super hotter.

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, sorry.

246
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes, definitely.

247
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
Thank you.

248
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
What about Mateo?

249
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,520
What about Materia?

250
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,560
Matt-teria.

251
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,200
How about Bahamut?

252
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
How about Efreet?

253
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,000
Fight to the round.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,960
Hi, my name is Knights of the round.

255
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,200
Hi.

256
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,600
Hi, my name is Chocobob.

257
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, I get it.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
My name is Sid.

259
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
That's a much better one.

260
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
I should have used Sid.

261
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
It's like a real person's name.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,880
And can I tell you something?

263
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
It's a fucking hot guy's name.

264
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,760
Sid?

265
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
Yeah, I'm just going to just burn down it.

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,680
Travis.

267
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
Yes, somebody does actually say Blaze.

268
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,360
Silas Matthews.

269
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,080
How many Z's?

270
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,360
Just one.

271
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
Just the one regular.

272
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,840
Is it B-L-A with the apostrophe over at Z?

273
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,600
You mean Blase?

274
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,800
No.

275
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
No E.

276
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
B-L-A with apostrophe, Z.

277
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,960
Blaze.

278
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,520
Blutz.

279
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Silas Matthews, Preston James, Landon Edward,

280
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,640
Call Gregory, K-A-H-L, Indermichael.

281
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,600
Stop it.

282
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,840
Kane.

283
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,560
Whoa.

284
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,280
Wait, are these all?

285
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Wait, hold on.

286
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
Are these all like one name?

287
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
Like you would name a girl like Sue Ann?

288
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,560
I don't know what you're doing.

289
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Are you saying Indermichael as like a name?

290
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,200
Yeah.

291
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,800
I have a theory to run by you guys that I was just thinking about here.

292
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Okay, you know how the joke when like a rich dude gets a convertible

293
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,880
and everybody jokes that he's compensating for something?

294
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
What are you compensating for with your sports car, you know?

295
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,520
I feel like nerdy dads do this with their kids' names.

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:33,120
They will pick the like coolest, hardest sounding child's name

297
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,200
from popular fiction to compensate for,

298
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,160
like when I hear you named your kid Ender or Han, for example,

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,640
just to name two off the top of my head,

300
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,680
I feel like you're overcompensating for something.

301
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,440
You're trying to gird this child with a sort of veneer of rugged cool

302
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,080
that maybe has escaped you throughout your earlier years.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,240
But at the same time, I'm with you on that, Justin.

304
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
I genuinely am.

305
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
But at the same time, I've never met a Brody

306
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,400
that I wasn't like, damn, when I saw him.

307
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,560
When I saw, when I like maybe I became internet friends with them

308
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,840
in freshman orientation and then you see them for the first time

309
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,680
and you're like, God damn, Brody, you did great.

310
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
You got it right.

311
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
You did so good.

312
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
So is the reverse of that theory that if there was a dad

313
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
that was like super cool in high school,

314
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,680
so much so that he felt all this pressure to be cool

315
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,120
and behave the way that he did and he was like,

316
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,840
you know what, I don't want my son to be that cool.

317
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,080
No.

318
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm gonna name him Greedo.

319
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm gonna name him Bill.

320
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
Have you guys ever met a Bill that you were like, oh shit.

321
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,200
Is that short for William?

322
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,600
No.

323
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:47,920
No, it's not.

324
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,280
It's short for Billium.

325
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,120
It's standard Bill.

326
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
It's like the vanilla Bill.

327
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
Classic Bill.

328
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
I'm Vabila.

329
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,160
I think it's the inverse of the boy named Sue sort of strategy

330
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,560
where rather than having a less tough sounding name

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,480
that like crafts them into like a dynamic person,

332
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
what you're doing is like giving them a lifetime

333
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
of trying to live up to Riker.

334
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
Like they're just never gonna hit it.

335
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
They're gonna constantly fall short.

336
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,160
Y'all are dipping into some nerd ass shit

337
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
for your recommendations.

338
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
And I hope you understand that if a child is named Riker

339
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,920
or Ender or fucking lightsaber,

340
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,800
they're not gonna end up like a fucking Maurice.

341
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,080
You guys understand that yet?

342
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,600
Well, Maurice is probably not great.

343
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Drake.

344
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
Don't go with Maurice.

345
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
I like Maurice.

346
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
I do too, but that's not like a standard like,

347
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
oh, that's a good looking guy.

348
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,920
I bet just based on the name.

349
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,840
Oh, you're saying it's just not a hot guy name.

350
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,560
Not a hot guy name.

351
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
It's a subversive guy name.

352
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,400
I think you need a name that can evolve and change

353
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,080
as you get more or less physically beautiful.

354
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,240
Like if you, maybe you're Brodeus

355
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,840
when you're like a little,

356
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
you let yourself go a little bit.

357
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
You got some punch.

358
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,360
You're saying Brodeus is what happens.

359
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,440
Brodeus is like your full,

360
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,560
that's like someone says, hey Brody.

361
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,800
I don't deserve to be called Brody right now.

362
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,280
I haven't seen the inside of a gym for three months.

363
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,560
I am not Brody.

364
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,600
That's your sweatpants name is what you're saying.

365
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,200
That's your cookie pants name is Brodeus.

366
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,920
So that intimates that my entire life,

367
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,920
my cookie pants name has been Griffin Andrew McElroy

368
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
and that someday I'll get totally blasted

369
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,200
and I'll be-

370
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,580
Grifter.

371
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
Grifter with five Y's in the middle.

372
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,040
Yep, I am worried that when you two have boy babies,

373
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,640
you're gonna like dip into this bizarre well

374
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,120
of like hacker names,

375
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
like weird cyberpunk names like Grifter with four Y's.

376
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Deslin with three Y's.

377
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Deslin with three Y's and a zero and a one in there together.

378
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,600
We asked all of you for follow ups

379
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,840
if you gave us a question, we answered it

380
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
and you did or did not follow our advice.

381
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
We wanted to hear about it.

382
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Don't let this segment make you think

383
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,320
we've changed our mind about you

384
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
not doing the things we tell you to do

385
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
because you still definitely don't.

386
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,960
That definitely not.

387
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
So let's check in with a few of these.

388
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,800
Travis didn't really call them down to the good ones

389
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
so we'll just take a shot.

390
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
They're all good in their own special way.

391
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
You answered two of my questions

392
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
but I only took your advice on one because I'm lazy.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
In episode 159, you answered my question

394
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,360
about apologizing to a friend about dating her ex.

395
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
My cover name was Monster Engine.

396
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
That's a great cover name.

397
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
Good cover name.

398
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,920
I decided to take Travis's advice of Envino Veritas

399
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,040
and got drunk with her.

400
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,920
What of all?

401
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,160
What were we doing?

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
Well, sorry, what the fuck was Travis doing?

403
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,160
It did not devolve into Envino Punchitas, fortunately.

404
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,040
We laughed about it and she forgave me entirely.

405
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,240
In fact, she is now a listener

406
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,680
of your hilarious and amazing show.

407
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
You guys also read a Jumbotron from me

408
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
and my boyfriend Eric in episode 183, which is fantastic.

409
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
It was only a month after our anniversary

410
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,680
so don't sweat the fuck up.

411
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,520
Don't worry, I wasn't.

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
That is good to hear.

413
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm glad that that panned out okay for you.

414
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
I like this one specifically

415
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,840
because I cannot remember what we talked about,

416
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,720
but it's this.

417
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Hey brothers, you answered my question

418
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
on episode 104 concerning song choice at karaoke.

419
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,920
After your suggestions of don't choose a downer,

420
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,240
something good but would claim to like ironically

421
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
and smack my rep dick on the mic.

422
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,760
We didn't say, we would never.

423
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,560
I ended up choosing Some Like It Hot by the Power Station.

424
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,360
It was a hit that ended up getting people clapping

425
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,160
to the beat.

426
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,000
Unfortunately, I did not get the chance

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
to throw the goods around

428
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,920
but I'm sure it would have earned a standing ovation.

429
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Thanks for the help,

430
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,280
the artist formerly known as Thunderwaffle.

431
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,920
It's pretty good.

432
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,880
We couldn't have said don't put your dick on something.

433
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,920
That doesn't sound like us.

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
That doesn't sound like us.

435
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,760
We're very conservative with dick exposure.

436
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
Somebody put together this incredible video

437
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
of all of the final questions that we've done

438
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,240
throughout like the history of our show for four years.

439
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,680
It was an immense labor.

440
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah, it's like an hour long or something, it's crazy.

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
It's a lot.

442
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
And I listened to all of it

443
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,680
and I didn't remember anything before.

444
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,520
No kidding, 196.

445
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,080
Every so often I see like NBNBA and Wisdom

446
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
will tweet like a quote from the show

447
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,920
where I go, who said that?

448
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
Oh, it was me.

449
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,760
Okay, cool.

450
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
It was me three and a half years ago.

451
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,160
Weird.

452
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,920
And then there's some despicable things

453
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,680
that come from NBNBA and Wisdom.

454
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,440
I think, oh no, who said that?

455
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,400
That was very naughty.

456
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Yikes.

457
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,480
Those are very bad boys.

458
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
They have maybe gotten some more progressive views

459
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
about a couple of things

460
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,200
and learned a few things about how to be sensitive

461
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,840
and in the world.

462
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,680
Maybe since they said that, maybe they don't know that.

463
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,520
Maybe.

464
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,840
Yes.

465
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
Sure has been a good 200 episodes.

466
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
It's been a great 200 episodes and growing.

467
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,080
Humiliation.

468
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Oh, the growing.

469
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,800
Here's another one.

470
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Petting zoo boyfriend here from episode 162.

471
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,280
My lady and I decided to just have a kid

472
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,040
so we could take her to the petting zoo.

473
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Follow-up question.

474
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,160
How old does she have to be to go to the petting zoo?

475
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,720
She's about three months old by the time you read this.

476
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
Don't question the numbers, Travis.

477
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
That's Zany and Zaftik at the zoo.

478
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
That's Bathroom Monster, right?

479
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,600
This child is Bathroom Monster?

480
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
That was, yeah, absolutely.

481
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,300
Right.

482
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
Is that the same one that like,

483
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
you know what, we get a lot of questions like this.

484
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
It reminds me of the guy who got a lot of tickets

485
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
at like the showbiz pizza

486
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,560
and didn't know if he could hand them off to kids safely.

487
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,320
I'd like to hear from that person.

488
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
Kids are tricky, guys.

489
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
We get a lot of questions

490
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
that are from people worried

491
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,200
about looking like child abductors.

492
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,400
I feel like this is a very common issue

493
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,840
plaguing today's young people.

494
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,600
Or today's old people.

495
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
Or today's people.

496
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
Just like take a child.

497
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,000
I actually have been struggling with this

498
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
now that I have a kid on the way.

499
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,160
I want the child to experience everything.

500
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,200
I want to show them the world shining, shimmering, splendid.

501
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,720
But I want them to appreciate it when I go.

502
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,520
If I'm gonna lay out the money to do the Disney thing,

503
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
I gotta know that they're gonna be forging childhood memories

504
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,360
and not some vague, hazy, you know,

505
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
recall of a man in a mouse suit.

506
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,240
I can't have that.

507
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
It's gotta be crystallized memories.

508
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,800
But this puts me in an unenviable position of like,

509
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,320
so am I just not supposed to do anything good for five years?

510
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,680
Am I just supposed to stall

511
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
and wait till the kid is forming like

512
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,920
really great crystallized memories?

513
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,680
I don't know what to do with them.

514
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,600
I don't want to waste a bunch of time and energy

515
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
if the kid's not gonna remember everything.

516
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
Let me throw this out, Justin.

517
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay.

518
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,160
Tell the kid that you went to Disney World

519
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,360
with them when they were three.

520
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,160
Yeah.

521
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
So when they're like seven,

522
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
they're like, I want to go to Disney World.

523
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
You've already been there.

524
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Don't you remember?

525
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,840
We just took you there for years.

526
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,400
You just went.

527
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
We were just there.

528
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,080
We just got back in 2007.

529
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
I sent you a question for episode 108

530
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
about getting my sexy so right as a gamer.

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
You told me to get super fit, dress classy,

532
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
and not give any fucks about what people think about my gaming.

533
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,680
Well, since then, I've lost 10 pounds,

534
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,840
completed two half marathons,

535
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
and greatly improved my wardrobe.

536
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,680
Best of all, about a year after I wrote it,

537
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,040
I met my super wonderful girlfriend

538
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,720
who's as into games as I am.

539
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
Lately, we've been marathoning through this-

540
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
All right, man, I don't need to know everything.

541
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,520
We don't need to know about your perverse sexual habits.

542
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880
I lost interest.

543
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,000
I lost interest when it stopped being about how great we are.

544
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,680
But I introduced you to the show,

545
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,800
and now we listen every week.

546
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,440
Oh, thank you.

547
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
Thank you for the wonderful help and support over the years.

548
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,280
That's from formerly digitally distraught in Davis.

549
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,640
108.

550
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,160
That was 92 episodes ago.

551
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,560
That's insane.

552
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm just gonna throw this out.

553
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,560
If I run two half marathons in my life,

554
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,640
I tell people I ran a whole marathon.

555
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,920
But using that logic, Travis,

556
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,240
and I can say that I've probably run like 80 marathons just-

557
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,760
I take a hefty break.

558
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,040
Just with the cumulative total of walking,

559
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,800
of perambulating that I've done.

560
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,240
You ran a whole marathon?

561
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,720
Yeah.

562
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Yeah, I ran half of it,

563
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,080
and I had to catch my breath.

564
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
For two and a half years.

565
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,480
For two and a half years.

566
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,000
I didn't really think about what it meant

567
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
to complete the marathon.

568
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
And then I didn't want to overexert myself,

569
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,600
so I took a break.

570
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
I finished it later.

571
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
I don't think they let you do that.

572
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,440
You come back to the same marathon two years later.

573
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
No, I paid last time.

574
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
No, no, I'm gonna start up there

575
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
because it's where I got last time.

576
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
Is that cool?

577
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,160
Just come stumbling out for the woods with a giant beard

578
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,520
and you're same numbered outfit.

579
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
Where have I been?

580
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
Okay, I'm coming in with you guys.

581
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
I wrote in two to three years ago,

582
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
worried about being taken seriously by my employees.

583
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,680
Justin laid down some wisdom

584
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,600
about being lavish with my affirmation

585
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,040
or something mushy like that.

586
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
And then the advice wound up

587
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
including something about a rubber baby, I think.

588
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,080
Sounds about right.

589
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,800
Post advice, I actually did try to be more positive

590
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,920
with my employees.

591
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
This was to no avail, all right?

592
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,080
Listen.

593
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
Win some, lose some.

594
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,720
The situation actually got-

595
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Poe Buddy's Nerfick, baby.

596
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
The situation actually got really bad.

597
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
The employees threw things at me.

598
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Cool, cool.

599
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
There are all sorts of racially insensitive

600
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
and otherwise inappropriate language.

601
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Yikes.

602
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,920
Directed physical intimidation.

603
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
And these people were older than my parents

604
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,320
and acting like this.

605
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,160
So I quit and went to grad school.

606
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,280
I graduate next week

607
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,600
and will be working as an individual contributor

608
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
in a more professional environment.

609
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,280
It would be hard to find a less professional environment.

610
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,800
They do let us off the hook and say,

611
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm not sure any advice could have saved me

612
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,920
from the situation I was in.

613
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,240
Thanks.

614
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Thanks for that, I guess.

615
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm glad we could make it so bad

616
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
you had to get out.

617
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
That was our plan all along.

618
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,000
That was our plan.

619
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
Listen, we knew you were in an unwinnable game.

620
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,040
Yeah.

621
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
So we set into motion-

622
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,280
The only way to win an unwinnable game

623
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,640
is to change the rules.

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,440
Or quit playing.

625
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,800
Kobayashi Maru.

626
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,200
Find a different game that's not Kobayashi Maru.

627
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
Or find an easier game.

628
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
Kobayashi Maru's a hot guy name.

629
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,360
Yeah.

630
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,120
That's what-

631
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,160
It sounds like two kids.

632
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,240
This is my son Kobayashi and Maru.

633
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
That's what Kobe Bryant's full name is.

634
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Listen, Travis just said that

635
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,480
and then one of you fuckos out there just went,

636
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,800
Uh-huh.

637
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,840
Hello.

638
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,440
Let me jot this down.

639
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Dear diary.

640
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
Then Kobayashi and Maru.

641
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
Maru is actually would not be a bad person.

642
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,080
Anyway.

643
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
Especially their twins.

644
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,680
You guys discussed various social dynamics

645
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,720
of hugging vis-a-vis friend groups.

646
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,800
But what if you're in a situation

647
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,640
where you want to hug some of the people in the group

648
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,600
but not all of them?

649
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,000
I hang out with a group of friends on the reg

650
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,160
and mostly I don't see those people

651
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
outside the group situations.

652
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
I like everyone but I'm kind of picky

653
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
who I let in my touch bubble.

654
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,040
And-

655
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,520
Touch bubble would be a good name for a kid.

656
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Yeah.

657
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,440
That's a hot guy name.

658
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
This season on Survivor,

659
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,320
Hey, I'm touch bubble.

660
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Hey ladies, touch bubble here.

661
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,920
So hot to handle, too cold to hold.

662
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
Because he's got a very small touch bubble.

663
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,720
And only some of the people in this group qualify.

664
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,160
I want to hug them.

665
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,040
But I don't-

666
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,160
Because I don't see them much.

667
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Otherwise, I don't want to make the non-huggables feel bad.

668
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,760
Is there a way to negotiate this smoothly?

669
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,480
I need a hug.

670
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,880
That's from-

671
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,080
I need a hug but not from you.

672
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,640
Oh, that's so tricky.

673
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,000
It's so true.

674
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,160
You've got to start thinking like a velociraptor.

675
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,640
You have to separate the group.

676
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,040
You have to lead one off from the herd.

677
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,360
Hey Dylan, could you step in the bedroom with me?

678
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
I just want to hug you in private.

679
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,360
Well, not the bedroom.

680
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,160
If you're going to conduct a secret-

681
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,600
Will you step in the laundry room with me?

682
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,560
Secret hug business.

683
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,440
Physical, intimate act.

684
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,920
Yeah.

685
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
You don't do the bedroom.

686
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,520
You cannot-

687
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,280
Will you step into my hug panic room, please?

688
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
You cannot bust your touch bubble in the bedroom.

689
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
It is inappropriate.

690
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
I'm saying just weed them off.

691
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,960
Maybe it's just like a line of sight thing.

692
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,720
Where you come up from behind while the rest of the group is watching, you know, Eurovision

693
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
or something, and then you hug them.

694
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

695
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,200
Quick, now, now, now!

696
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,320
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

697
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,600
Well, you can't fucking rush it is the problem.

698
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,760
You can't dip in their stealth and then bust that bubble and then get out in like half

699
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
a second, because that's going to be a shitty ass hug.

700
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
You need to get a full embrace.

701
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,120
You need to go chin to shoulder.

702
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040
Can I throw this out?

703
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,560
This is the third time you said throw this out.

704
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,600
You've got to get-

705
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,320
Just do it.

706
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,440
Be more confident.

707
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
Let me interject this.

708
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:08,800
Okay.

709
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
Please allow me to insert this into the conversation.

710
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
Excuse me while I whip this out.

711
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,880
What if you just fucking do it and you look the unhuggables dead in the eye, and then

712
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,200
when Deborah's like, hey, how come we never hug?

713
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,720
Say, hey, remember that time when I tried to tell you about my meanwhile surgery and

714
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
you kind of cold-shouldered me?

715
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
That's why.

716
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,400
Or, or, while you're giving this other person a deep, deep chin to shoulder hug, you make

717
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:44,400
eye contact with the unhuggables and you whisper, unhuggable, just to really let them know where

718
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,960
they stay.

719
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,440
I get it.

720
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Like this happens a lot when like we'll go on these overnight trips with a big group

721
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,240
of friends and maybe we're standing at a lake house and just like bonding.

722
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,920
Oh, the tightest bonding.

723
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,360
Bonfire secrets and lakeside memories.

724
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
And then at the end, everybody's going their separate ways and you get that little bit

725
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,600
of summer camp tinge of like, ah, I'm going to miss you fools because we're not going

726
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
to hang out constantly like we did this weekend.

727
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,640
You start hugging everyone.

728
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,680
And then there's like, and then there's blaze that like your buddy works with who he brought

729
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,720
and he's fine, but like you haven't known him long enough to get those lakeside memories

730
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
going with blaze quite yet.

731
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,880
Like the only awkward time for the entire weekend was when you and blaze found yourself

732
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,280
making pop darts at the same time in the kitchen.

733
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,760
It was only the two of you.

734
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,240
Hey, man.

735
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,800
Hey.

736
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,120
Hey.

737
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,600
Hey.

738
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,720
Hey, pop darts.

739
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,040
You having a good time?

740
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,600
So silly, right?

741
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah.

742
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,760
Toaster pastry.

743
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,400
Who knew?

744
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Kyle seems cool.

745
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
Yeah, Kyle is pretty cool.

746
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,560
I've known him my whole life.

747
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,680
Blaze, who are you?

748
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,240
What are you?

749
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,720
Interloper.

750
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,560
I find myself in this situation with surprising frequency and I just do it.

751
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,280
Just hug them.

752
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,680
Whatever.

753
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,960
Just hug them.

754
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,240
Just hug them.

755
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,160
You're not going to start.

756
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,320
You have to start hugging blaze sometime.

757
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
You're going, listen, you're going to hug blaze.

758
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,440
That'll make it all the more special because like blaze sees you hugging everybody else.

759
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
And then one day seven trips in, you hug blaze and blaze is like, I'm in.

760
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,960
Have you ever, have either of you ever met somebody who is like a friend of a friend

761
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,000
who like all of your other friends know and you just haven't met yet.

762
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,320
And then they come up to you and they say, oh, hey.

763
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,360
And then they just go in immediately, immediately from the jump.

764
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
Yes, that person is named Travis Patrick Mackerel.

765
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,880
Okay.

766
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,520
But like outside of yourself, have you met a person like that?

767
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,800
And then not immediately been like, oh, I like that blaze.

768
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,640
You know what I mean?

769
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,560
Like they go, they just fucking go for it from the jump and it lets you know, like,

770
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,960
I can feel comfortable with this person.

771
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,720
I can feel comfortable getting to know this person because they're very warm, very inviting.

772
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
They go full blown chin to shoulder, guaranteed a hundred percent of the time.

773
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,080
What everybody wanted at the end of the day is to be liked, you know?

774
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,400
And I think that if you can give off that vibe that you like the person you're interacting with,

775
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,000
it doesn't take forever to build a relationship or a rapport.

776
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
People really respond to that.

777
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,680
So just go in for the hug.

778
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,000
What I like about it is it kind of skips a lot of awkwardness by saying like,

779
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,320
hey, even if we're faking it, we can be comfortable around each other.

780
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,920
Like we're, you know, like let's pretend like we've known each other forever

781
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,320
and just skip past all the shit where you don't know me.

782
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Skip the shit.

783
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,080
There's a lot of shit in getting to know somebody.

784
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,520
And it's this, it's this shit of are we hugging friends yet?

785
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,160
Fuck that.

786
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Just hug that creep.

787
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm hungry.

788
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
Is your I'm hungry trying to get in the money zone?

789
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,120
Yeah.

790
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,620
Okay.

791
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,520
Teach me how to snacky.

792
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't know what you mean.

793
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
You haven't said money zone yet.

794
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,480
Money zone.

795
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:38,980
Okay.

796
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,720
Kind of giving away what the contents of the money zone is.

797
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,400
I know a little preview taste for the audience.

798
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
Here's a little sneak sneak taste.

799
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
Snack sneak.

800
00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:03,920
It's going to, it will involve snacking.

801
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,200
You slide to the left.

802
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
That's not what that is.

803
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,320
No, that's it.

804
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,800
You slide to the left and then you get on www.naturebox.com

805
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,000
because you remember that you left your computer slightly to the left.

806
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,880
Just out of reach.

807
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,080
What do I do once I'm there, Jeff?

808
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,200
What do you do once you go to www.naturebox.com?

809
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Yes.

810
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,600
You're going to start snacking smarter.

811
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,680
Well, not eating all that bullshit.

812
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,560
Not instantly.

813
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:26,960
It's not.

814
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,160
You click on the website and then you have, there are snacks in your mouth.

815
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
Griffin, do you know what makes the best sauce?

816
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,400
What does?

817
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:50,160
Worcestershire.

818
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,600
You dumb piece of shit.

819
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,320
For a second, I thought you were talking about a food product

820
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
on the nature box website.

821
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,600
Okay.

822
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,720
So you click on the website.

823
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,320
You immediately have food in your mouth.

824
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
What else do you have to do?

825
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,160
You got to choose the snacks you want.

826
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,640
They got BBQ kettle kernels.

827
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,600
They got everything.

828
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,400
Bagel sticks.

829
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,240
I heard there's some stuff with seaweed that's pretty good on Twitter.

830
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,760
Somebody told us that.

831
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,000
The South Pacific plantain chips.

832
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,880
There's over a hundred more.

833
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,680
There's a ton of stacks.

834
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,760
They're all like healthy enough trans fat or high for just corn syrup.

835
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
And they're not genetically modified or any of that garbage.

836
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
They're just healthy and good for you.

837
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,320
And they're cheap.

838
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,800
Because if you use our special URL, then you can get 50% off your first box.

839

That's half off.

I don't not only that, but free shipping always.

841

Oh yeah.

842
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,800

Stay full.

848
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,840
Stay strong.

849
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,240
Get those caramel pretzel pops because God damn.

850
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,880
It's all delicious.

851
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
Thank you nature box for sponsoring our program.

852
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,280
Yeah.

853
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,560
And thank you to Squarespace who's also supporting my brother, my brother, me.

854
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
It's the all in one platform that makes it super fast and super easy to make your

855
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,320
own professional website or online portfolio.

856
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
They got updates.

857
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
You thought you knew Squarespace.

858
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
You don't know shit.

859
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
Shut your mouth.

860
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
It's uninformed.

861
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,040
They got beautiful designs you can start with.

862
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
You can start from scratch.

863
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
They got style options.

864
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,600
Whoa.

865
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,160
Whoa.

866
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,960
Style options.

867
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
Nobody told me there'd be style options.

868
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
Style options is a pretty hot name for a kid.

869
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,880
It's like a hat for your website.

870
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,720
And you put it on there and it's something new with the style options.

871
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,760
It sounds pricey.

872
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,880
It's not pricey.

873
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,760
You understand that these people are paying us to talk about their awesome product.

874
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm not saying it sounds like it's going to be expensive.

875
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
This sounds the worst.

876
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,360
It's not.

877
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,000
It's awesome.

878
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,520
It's $8 a month.

879
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
And that includes a free domain name if you sign up for a year, which is a steal.

880
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
Justin has bought so many domain names.

881
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,080
So maybe he can speak to like how much those cost normally for Fart Patrol.

882
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,520
And what's the other one?

883
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,120
What's the fartpatrol.com?

884
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,400
You got the dot com on that one.

885
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
What's the other one that you just bought?

886
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,920
And fartpatrol.gov.

887
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
I wish I had fartpatrol.gov.

888
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,200
I cannot get that.

889
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,520
The NSA actually has that, believe it or not.

890
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,960
What is the other website?

891
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,000
It was like the smoothest, smoothest, smoothest face.

892
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,640
My smooth face.

893
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,120
Hold on one second.

894
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,600
I'll tell you.

895
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,560
Let's see.

896
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,440
I own fartpatrol.com.

897
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,760
Yeah.

898
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,360
griffinspacejam.com.

899
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,480
You own that?

900
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:46,800
Yeah.

901
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,840
That's mine.

902
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,560
Mysmoothface.com is what you're thinking of.

903
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,440
We're going to get rid of that.

904
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,200
We're going to sell that off for fucking...

905
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,720
We'll retire.

906
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,400
We will retire off My Smooth Face.

907
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,960
If you go to our website, but you don't use fartpatrol.com to get there,

908
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't know what's wrong with you.

909
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,040

Hold on.

927
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,120
Spencer Ohan is a thoughtful, energetic Bay Area pop musician

928
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,080
who idolizes Prince and They Might Be Giants equally.

929
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,360
And for a lot of the same reasons, their dress sense.

930
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,760
His brand new album called Blue Circle is available now in vinyl and digital formats.

931
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,560
He sang, wrote and played it all himself just for you.

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,880
That's one word.

935
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,440
My brother.

936
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,160
Justin, are you listening to this album right now?

937
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
I thought I'd lay it down underneath.

938
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,360
Kind of like...

939
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay.

940
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,440
Oh, I like this.

941
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,240
Yeah, it's good, right?

942
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,760
This is it work.

943
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,320
Some dumpy...

944
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,280
For Blue Circle.

945
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,080
Dumpy bass.

946
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,320
Leave it on the ground.

947
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
Maybe he's going to sing here or should I sing?

948
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,120
Let's play this over our next one.

949
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,160
Turn the treble all the way up and turn everything else down because that's how I like to listen to

950
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,560
the music.

951
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,200
Oh, this is good.

952
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay.

953
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,240
This is at thespencerohan.com.

954
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay.

955
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,840
You understand that this is arguably the worst way to listen to music.

956
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,880
We're not doing Spencer Ohan.

957
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,840
I don't disagree.

958
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,800
But like, what are we going to do?

959
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,360
Edit it in?

960
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
I have a message for Pizza Zach.

961
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,200
And it's from Caramel.

962
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,560
I love that.

963
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,440
Uh, who says, happy belated birthday to my best friend.

964
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
Hope you enjoy this birthday message because I couldn't think of anything else to get you

965
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,240
that wasn't yoga clothes.

966
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh, Pizza Zach.

967
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
Your interests are so single faceted.

968
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,800
And who else?

969
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,440
Do you know, Zach?

970
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,560
He only likes two things.

971
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,840
This podcast about hot guy names and pizza and yoga clothes.

972
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,560
So three things.

973
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, he eats the pizza while he does yoga.

974
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,320
It's really fast.

975
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,640
He eats pizza.

976
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
That doesn't mean he likes it.

977
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,600
If somebody invents a yoga that you do while eating pizza, they're going to be rich.

978
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,440
And who else could help appropriately celebrate this milestone than the McElroy brothers themselves.

979
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,960
So happy quarter of a century.

980
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
And here's to getting it done in 20 forward.

981
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
Hashtag blessed.

982
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,400
I don't like thinking of my age as being above a quarter of a century.

983
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
It bums me out in pretty big way.

984
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
We're all dying.

985
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,680
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

986
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,240
Hello, my name is Graham Clark.

987
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,360
My name is Dave Shamka.

988
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,560
Together we host a show called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

989
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,520
We're from Canada.

990
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

991
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,120
And every week we're lucky enough to be joined by a guest, sometimes a comedian,

992
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,840
or sometimes just somebody that we like and somebody probably you've never heard of.

993
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,080
But trust us.

994
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,240
If you followed us this far into the promo, just try it out, please.

995
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,400
Do we sound too desperate?

996
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,120
Stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

997
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,560
Let's check in with somebody else.

998
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,400
Who's also dying.

999
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,680
Stop it.

1000
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,440
You're killing me.

1001
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Wait, pretend I said that.

1002
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,040
Pretend I said something else.

1003
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,360
I got advice from you in episode 130, Holy Terror.

1004
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,160
I wanted to send you an update for episode 200 check-ins.

1005
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
You understand that's check-ins, not check-ins.

1006
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,280
Hey, check-ins.

1007
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
Hey, I got a hot check-in for you.

1008
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,280
And I wrote in asking if it was okay to have a friend slash ex-girlfriend help me pick

1009
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,680
out a gift for a current girlfriend.

1010
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,600
I loosely followed the advice Travis gave me and had my friend who you dubbed Large Mark.

1011
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,680
Why would we do that?

1012
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,280
Note she is actually a petite Asian girl.

1013
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,560
Recommend some hip stores rather than a specific gift.

1014
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,360
And with that, I was able to pick out a nice gift myself.

1015
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,680
The present was a hit with my girlfriend.

1016
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
We are still dating to this day and very much in love.

1017
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,960
Because of that present.

1018
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,800
In addition, I got a chance to introduce my friend and my girlfriend, and they hit it

1019
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,160
off really well.

1020
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,160
I've been listening to the show since around episode 16, and I'm a max fund donor.

1021
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,960
Thanks for the great work.

1022
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,400
Looking forward to the next 100 episodes.

1023
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,040
Thanks again.

1024
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
Gift blind guy in Minneapolis.

1025
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,920
Okay, that one turned out really fucking well.

1026
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,280
That is incredible.

1027
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,320
You are welcome.

1028
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,160
So let me follow that up with this one.

1029
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm hungry and awkward.

1030
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,960
The guy who wondered if his Chinese delivery guy was flirting by adding extra things in

1031
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,760
my order.

1032
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,440
I weighed the value of the food against the awkwardness of the situation and decided to

1033
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
say screw it and asked him out.

1034
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,400
Wasn't gay.

1035
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,040
He had no idea about the extra stuff.

1036
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Turned out the dude was just a friendly guy.

1037
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,520
Luckily, it was a totally not awkward situation.

1038
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,440
We both laughed it off, and I'm still able to order my whole grilled fish and weird spicy

1039
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,720
sauce without problem.

1040
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,200
He even pointed out another dude who works there who was gay, but sadly that did not

1041
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,320
work out well.

1042
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,440
Satisfied and secure.

1043
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Well, you're welcome.

1044
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,520
You're welcome.

1045
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,040
I mean, you definitely did.

1046
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm almost certain.

1047
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,520
I don't remember this specific question, but I'm almost certain we would not tell anybody

1048
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,680
regardless of their gender or sexual preference to ask out a person that delivers food to

1049
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,560
them professionally.

1050
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,600
But I'm glad it didn't work out.

1051
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm glad it didn't work out because we told you it wouldn't and didn't.

1052
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,120
Don't lie.

1053
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
Here's a good one.

1054
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,280
Back in episode 87, I asked you how to gain weight for a movie role and signed an irritatingly

1055
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,040
thin Portland hipster.

1056
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,520
I ate a ton of bread because that's what I could afford, and I gained 10 pounds.

1057
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,640
I did not, as Travis suggested, do a ton of squats to try to gain the weight all in my

1058
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:06,960
legs.

1059
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,760
That was a quote.

1060
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,240
Quote, all in my legs.

1061
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,680
But I still looked a little bigger, and it read well on camera.

1062
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,440
I'm now slightly less than LA Hipster, and the movie, A Tale of the Light, comes out

1063
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
on video on demand this month.

1064
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,400
Thanks, Brian.

1065
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,440
I'm glad that worked out for you.

1066
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,640
And the movie, Yum Yum Bread Boy, comes out on video on demand this month.

1067
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
Silly Billy the Bread King.

1068
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,400
And the movie, Johnny Huge Legs, comes out on video on demand this month.

1069
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,080
Can't wait to catch it.

1070
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,840
This is great.

1071
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,800
Writing a follow up on advice given about my friend's fantasy football league I had

1072
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,640
been forcibly drafted into.

1073
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,080
Your advice was threefold.

1074
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,520
One, get out of the league.

1075
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,120
Two, moneyball.

1076
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,440
Three, something about looking at players' teeth.

1077
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,400
Well, just wanted to let you know that my friend got in trouble at work and lost his

1078
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,920
internet privileges, so the league collapsed before it even began.

1079
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,720
Happy endings all around, thanks for the advice.

1080
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
That's from Sam from Lakewood.

1081
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,520
Wonderful.

1082
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,640
Wonderful.

1083
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,400
We solved another one, gang.

1084
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,480
We actually reported your league commissioner to his boss at work.

1085
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
That actually would have been a much better idea.

1086
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,520
I wish we had created that, because that would have been a great plan.

1087
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,920
Well, that's some Machiavellian shit.

1088
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,960
I don't think we could have...

1089
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,560
I don't think we're capable of generating...

1090
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,680
Sun Tzu nonsense.

1091
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,800
You must undo him.

1092
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,960
Y'all want Yahoo?

1093
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,920
Yep.

1094
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,840
This Yahoo was sent in by Campbell Bird.

1095
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,720
Thank you, Campbell.

1096
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,080
That's a great fucking name.

1097
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,240
That's a pretty hot guy name.

1098
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,800
Super hot.

1099
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Liv who asks,

1100
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,840
"'How to command attention and have a presence?

1101
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,880
"'When I walk into a room, I want to look like I mean business.

1102
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,800
"'I want to have a thing about me that makes people look up and pay attention

"'Is it something to with appearance...?'

1106
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,840
Oh, God.

1107

"'Is it something to with appearance, the clothes I wear?

"'How can I fix this?''

1114
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,280
You can wear a t-shirt that says swag.

1115
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,800
That's pretty good.

1116
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,880
I mean, it says it all.

1117
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,240
Not great for...

1118
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,800
Says it all.

1119
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,080
It does say...

1120
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,480
Who doesn't look good?

1121
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,800
Who doesn't command attention on a sweet t-shirt with simple type swag?

1122
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,560
I don't think I would look great in that, Travis.

1123
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,640
I think you would, Griffin.

1124
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,560
I think I might actually look pretty bad in that.

1125
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,640
Can you get a pallbearer?

1126
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,200
I'm sorry.

1127
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
Like the wrestler, not an actual...

1128
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,760
Oh, yes.

1129
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,440
You need a hype man.

1130
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,640
We're coming for you at Summer Slam, Hogan.

1131
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,560
Uh, I'm sorry.

1132
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,680
I asked if you wanted fries with your hamburger.

1133
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,040
We're coming for you.

1134
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,360
How about an animal mask?

1135
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,000
How about George the Animal Steel?

1136
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,360
What about Coco Beware?

1137
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Can you get Coco Beware to follow you around?

1138
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,760
It's gotta-

1139
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,480
Justin, I feel like you're really thinking inside the box on this one.

1140
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah, I can't get myself out of the box.

1141
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,560
Give me the high points of the question again.

1142
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,240
How to command attention and have a presence.

1143
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,520
I want to look like I mean fucking business when I walk in a room.

1144
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,080
What is it?

1145
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,640
Posture?

1146
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,200
Clothes?

1147
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,400
How do I present myself?

1148
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,360
I'm invisible now.

1149
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,160
Sincerely, the invisible boy.

1150
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
How about you set your shoulders on fire?

1151
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,280
Like in what?

1152
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,160
Like in the Hunger Games.

1153
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,640
Like the-

1154
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,360
Like just, yeah.

1155
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,720
Just as you're about to walk in the room,

1156
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,880
set your shoulders on fire.

1157
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,160
Every time you walk in a room,

1158
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,960
be wearing a magic dress that Lenny Kravitz made you

1159
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,360
that when you spin around, it turns into fiery birds.

1160
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,400
I don't see why you're having such a hard fucking time with this.

1161
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,600
That's 101.

1162
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,480
That's 101.

1163
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Lenny Kravitz will make you a magic dress.

1164
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,840
Call Lenny Kravitz.

1165
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,080
Call Lenny Kravitz.

1166
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,040
1-800-LENNY.

1167
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,200
1-800-LENNY.

1168
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,240
He's sitting by the phone.

1169
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,840
He's sitting by the phone, waiting for your call.

1170
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,240
He will make you a magic dress.

1171
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
Lenny Kravitz's are standing by.

1172
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,880
They're multiple Krav-I.

1173
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,240
They will make you fiery dresses.

1174
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,960
Wasting our time.

1175
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,880
Make sure it's a big room, though.

1176
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,600
Those fiery birds don't know where the fuck to go.

1177
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,720
They're made out of fire.

1178
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,960
Lenny Kravitz makes you promise to use it only outdoors.

1179
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,920
I'll give you this fiery dress-

1180
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,280
And only for good.

1181
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,400
I can't go back to jail, man.

1182
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,480
With fiery Lenny Kravitz dress comes great responsibility.

1183
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,840
Spider-Man 3 in theaters now took a couple liberties.

1184
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,880
Organic web shooters?

1185
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,600
What are webs?

1186
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,080
What are webs?

1187
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,560
There are no ends to this.

1188
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
What is a spider?

1189
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,320
Uncle Ben is Lenny Kravitz?

1190
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,240
That seems like you're retconning a little bit.

1191
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,160
Sally Field also Lenny Kravitz, huh?

1192
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,480
Okay.

1193
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,080
I don't remember there being so many fiery dresses or birds.

1194
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,720
Excelsior, I guess.

1195
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,200
Stanley is in it, though.

1196
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,680
He's the voice of one of the fiery birds.

1197
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,040
Hail, true believers.

1198
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,440
Look at my beautiful Lenny Kravitz dress.

1199
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,680
Sorry about your hair, lady.

1200
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,640
I set it on fire, Excelsior.

1201
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,320
I like how his uncle is named Ben

1202
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,520
as if we just forgot about that rice.

1203
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:17,760
Yeah.

1204
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,360
Same guy.

1205
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,400
Same guy.

1206
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,960
That's how Peter can afford to do all this science shit.

1207
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,600
Exactly.

1208
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,680
Guys, is it just confidence?

1209
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,960
Is that how you command shit?

1210
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,280
I don't know.

1211
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,280
I'm pretty confident, and I don't feel like I command anything yet.

1212
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,000
The problem is you're not hoving into enough people's field of view.

1213
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,880
If you stand in one place in a room, people only address you

1214
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,080
or are made aware of you when they're looking directly at you.

1215
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:53,360
You've got to get on the hustle to start getting in front of people more.

1216
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,840
What the fuck did you just say?

1217
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,040
I mean, you need to move throughout the room more

1218
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,640
so people have to address you more often.

1219
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,320
I want them to turn around and you're there again.

1220
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,280
Maybe with doing a very quiet, almost an audible techno beat under your breath

1221
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,440
as you chug a chug around the room to be in front of everybody all at once.

1222
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,240
Just oots, oots, oots, oots.

1223
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,240
You know Mysterio from the Spider-Man 3 movie?

1224
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,280
It seems like he could pull this off.

1225
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,680
It turns out that Mysterio was the one in charge of all the confusion

1226
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,520
and all the fiery bird dresses and stuff.

1227
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,080
It was a trick to make Spider-Man forget he was ever born.

1228
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,560
If you want more people to notice you, you just have to be in all places at once.

1229
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,760
You have to have a glass dome on your head like Mysterio.

1230
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
Allow me to leave you with this.

1231
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,920
Okay, leave us with something.

1232
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,560
Rather than asking people to look at you, dare them not to.

1233
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,000
Next question.

1234
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,800
What is that?

1235
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1236
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,640
Griffin, you seem very concrete about it being time for the next question.

1237
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,440
I'm sorry, but when Travis uses that voice, I have to comply.

1238
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Starting next month, two of my friends and I will be moving into a new house together.

1239
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,120
Each of us will have our own bedroom,

1240
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,800
but there's an extra medium-sized room downstairs no one will be using.

1241
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,040
The room has no egress window, so we don't want to make it into a bedroom.

1242
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,120
Got some code issues there, dig it.

1243
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,760
But we're at a loss for what we should do with it.

1244
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,160
I was hoping the brothers could come give us ideas about what we could do with this extra space.

1245
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,640
Any thoughts?

1246
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,720
That's from MiniProblem in Minneapolis.

1247
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,720
P.S. for what it's worth, we're all guys.

1248
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,940
Hot guys?

1249
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,520
All hot guys.

1250
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,440
Sincerely, Chad, Brad, and Blaze.

1251
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,080
Did you say Blizz?

1252
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,480
Three-

1253
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,040
And Blizz.

1254
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,000
Three hot bros.

1255
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,440
Blizz, Blaze, and Blonce.

1256
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,360
Just kidding, two of us.

1257
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,480
Blonce is the goofy one.

1258
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,360
Yeah, the goofy one.

1259
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,680
But it's still so hot.

1260
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,360
It's still super fucking hot.

1261
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,240
Incredibly gorgeous.

1262
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,200
Great work, Blonce.

1263
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,760
Blonce?

1264
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,960
He's Austrian.

1265
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,320
Guys, I didn't know egress windows were a thing.

1266
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,360
Because the first apartment we lived in, in the 13th story, which is great for starters,

1267
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,520
just in terms of fiery luck, we made Eric sleep in that one room that didn't have any windows in it.

1268
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,000
I think once you're on the 13th floor, Griffin, you don't have to worry about egress windows.

1269
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
Yeah, I don't think that's going to do you much good at that point.

1270
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,520
So how about this?

1271
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:42,560
Guys, lock the door to said room after filling it with like child's bedroom furniture that

1272
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,240
you've covered in dust and cobwebs.

1273
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,200
You're just leaving a little surprise for the next person that tries to remodel this place.

1274
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,720
Every time your friends come over and go,

1275
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,320
oh, I want a tour of your house.

1276
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,200
Yeah, this is the kitchen.

1277
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,840
Here's the living room.

1278
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,640
Our bedroom's upstairs.

1279
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,440
What's in that room?

1280
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,800
We don't go in there.

1281
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,080
We don't go in that room.

1282
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,000
Not since the boat accident.

1283
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,040
Travis, you just took that idea to 10.

1284
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,520
I'm about to take it just a little bit farther to 11.

1285
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,400
Can you wallpaper over the door to that room?

1286
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,640
Because then nobody's going to find it for 40 goddamn years,

1287
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,640
and it's going to have a level of authenticity at that point that I think is just going to-

1288
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,040
Ooh, and then in the center of the room, copy of Jumanji.

1289
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
Oh, wait a minute.

1290
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,680
The movie.

1291
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, you lost me.

1292
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,800
That's great.

1293
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,760
That's real great.

1294
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,560
That's great.

1295
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,280
That's great.

1296
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,920
That's great.

1297
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,240
That's great. That's real great.

1298
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,560
That's too funny.

1299
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,840
That can be where you smoke all your pot.

1300
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,600
That's always important.

1301
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,880
Drug room?

1302
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,480
This is our drug room.

1303
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,960
The laziest panic room.

1304
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,040
Just go in there.

1305
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,800
Close the door.

1306
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,840
Dude, this is tricky because I've worked from home for a long time

1307
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,960
in a couple of places, including the house that I now own with my wife.

1308
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,240
One of the bedrooms is where I sleep,

1309
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,440
and the other one is where I work because it's my office,

1310
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,120
and it's like I get two rooms?

1311
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,400
That doesn't really seem fair.

1312
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,200
That doesn't really seem like an equitable situation.

1313
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,800
You could trade off and say like Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

1314
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,040
the room can be whatever guy A wants,

1315
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,000
but then Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, it's whatever guy B wants,

1316
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,080
and then Sunday, you share it free for all party room.

1317
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,760
If you guys had an extra room in the houses you live in now,

1318
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,880
what would you do with it?

1319
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,080
Yoga studio.

1320
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,760
Did you say yogurt studio?

1321
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,040
Because then maybe.

1322
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,160
Yeah, it's where I paint yogurt.

1323
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,880
I think, gosh, I don't know.

1324
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,600
We just did like a big purge of all our stuff.

1325
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,360
We had one extra room, and that was for the kids,

1326
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,480
so I guess I don't have any extra rooms anymore now.

1327
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,600
I don't know what I would do with it.

1328
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,920
Maybe like just more storage?

1329
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,400
Oh, man, you really shot the cannon indoors with that one.

1330
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,240
Here's what I would do.

1331
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,280
I'd put a bunch of newspaper clippings

1332
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,680
and pictures of people around town on the wall,

1333
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,840
and then with thumbtacks and pieces of string,

1334
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,240
connect all of them with certain people's faces.

1335
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,400
I have always wanted a room like this.

1336
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,640
Yeah, that's like what does it all mean?

1337
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,600
Where'd the money go?

1338
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,840
What happened with the case?

1339
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,680
You know, just all over it.

1340
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,200
That's just there for people to walk into and go,

1341
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,240
what is, and like, I've almost got it.

1342
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,200
I've almost got it.

1343
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,760
It's right there on the tip of my tongue.

1344
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,200
I've almost solved it.

1345
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,480
And then usher them out of the room.

1346
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,720
So basically, Travis, you want an all-purpose goof room.

1347
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,840
Yeah, I want like a room of requirement

1348
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,200
that every time you open the door,

1349
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,120
it's a different punchline to a joke.

1350
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,400
Sure, okay.

1351
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,320
And a team of people that changes it out

1352
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,720
betwixt the goofs. And they live there.

1353
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,560
Can we just please have a bedroom here?

1354
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,960
Please, you call us in here.

1355
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,680
No, you can't.

1356
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,840
This is our all-purpose goof room.

1357
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,400
We will sleep on the inflatable mattress

1358
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,280
in the dining room.

1359
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,360
Because that's, I mean, we gotta have our goofs.

1360
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,480
We're human.

1361
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,840
What are we supposed to do, not goof?

1362
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,280
We're human.

1363
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,800
Humans have to goof.

1364
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,160
Humans gotta goof.

1365
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,360
Always be goofing.

1366
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:19,920
That's us.

1367
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,400
That's us.

1368
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,600
And that's our show.

1369
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,120
So I want to wrap up.

1370
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,680
Let's get one more of these follow-ups.

1371
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,520
This was the one I was most excited about reading,

1372
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,560
so I saved it for the end.

1373
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,000
I wrote in asking advice on how to get our babysitter

1374
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
just to skedaddle after my husband and I

1375
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,520
returned from a date night.

1376
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,600
You guys offered many practical solutions,

1377
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,680
and we naturally chose Justin's about faking

1378
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,120
explosive diarrhea immediately upon our return

1379
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,400
to apply to our next night out.

1380
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,440
So good.

1381
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,600
However, the fates intervened and it seemed

1382
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,680
it didn't smile on our planned dishonesty,

1383
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,520
as we didn't need the faking illness,

1384
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,400
and I got horribly carsick on the drive home from our date.

1385
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,240
It did end up rushing through the door

1386
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,640
and making it rain dollars on the babysitter

1387
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,920
on my way to the bathroom.

1388
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,720
So in that way, our plan was a success.

1389
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,400
Thanks so much for all you guys do.

1390
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,360
Really enjoy your show.

1391
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,160
Happy 200.

1392
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,480
Is karma punishing our listeners?

1393
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,520
It's not karma.

1394
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,880
It's not karma.

1395
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,560
It's fucking clairvoyance.

1396
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,040
We are the diarrhea mediums.

1397
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,400
Starring Patricia Arquette.

1398
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,720
I knew we'd be good for something someday.

1399
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,520
Predicting people's diarrhea.

1400
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,640
Don't get on our-

1401
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,440
At some point in the future, you will have diarrhea.

1402
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,880
Don't get on our bad side ever, listeners.

1403
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,120
Don't you hit that unsubscribe button.

1404
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,480
Jeff, who will have diarrhea on June 7th

1405
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,640
at three o'clock after eating that weird hot pocket

1406
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,280
in the back of his freezer he shouldn't have ate?

1407
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,520
They don't even make the meatball one anymore, Jeff,

1408
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,880
for this explicit reason.

1409
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,200
Enjoy your diarrhea, though.

1410
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,040
Maybe think about subscribing again in the future

1411
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,920
and becoming a donor.

1412
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,040
Only then will we repeal our curse.

1413
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,960
Well, that's gonna do it for us here

1414
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,600
on my brother and brother me episode two hundo.

1415
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,760
Gosh, I can't believe we made it,

1416
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,840
and we're so thankful, so, so, so thankful

1417
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,680
to all of you for sticking with us through thick and thin.

1418
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,000
We really do love you.

1419
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,600
I know, we don't say it enough.

1420
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,400
We don't.

1421
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,280
Thank you so much.

1422
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,520
This show is a crazy, crazy,

1423
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,280
I can't even call it a dream come true

1424
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,360
because like what psychopath would dream of something

1425
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,560
like what we do, it's crazy,

1426
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,160
and it's the best thing ever,

1427
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,320
and we're very, very, very thankful for it.

1428
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,200
Thank you to people tweeting about the show

1429
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,040

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1434
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,160
And thanks again to Naturebox.

Go check it out, naturebox.com.

1438
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,240

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,160
you'll get 50% off your first order.

1440
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,800
Go check it out.

1441
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,480
That's gonna do it for us, right?

1442
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,760
No, no, we're not even close.

1443
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1444
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,120
for the use of our theme song,

1445
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,280
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1446
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,440
You can get that wherever good music is sold.

1447
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,760
Don't go looking for it in the bad music store.

1448
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,880
You will not find it.

1449
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,960
I wanna remind you about BoatParty.biz,

1450
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,560
the Atlantic Ocean Music and Comedy Festival.

1451
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,360
They are still selling tickets to that,

1452
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,400
and it's gonna be amazing.

1453
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,320
You can go on a cruise to Jamaica,

1454
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,400
and they announced three new acts.

1455
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,960
The Antebalas, Afrobeat Orchestra, Lake, and Matt Braunger

1456
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,800
are all gonna be there.

1457
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,240
And a ton of like funny people

1458
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,080
and W. Kamau Bell and John Roderick and-

1459
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,200
Of the Long Winters.

1460
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,080
Of the Long Winters.

1461
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,120
Of fame.

1462
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,760
BoatParty.biz, go.

1463
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,960
Next week, we're probably gonna have to do a weird app.

1464
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,400
I'm not sure what it's gonna look like,

1465
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,000
but I'm going out of town for a while.

1466
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,440
We need to start saving up shit

1467
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,320
for the crazy three podcast day

1468
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,000
that we have coming up in a couple of weeks.

1469
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,240
So next week is probably gonna be,

1470
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,280
what is it gonna be, Juice?

1471
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,160
You wanna know my best of?

1472
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,800
Best of?

1473
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,840
Yeah, you and I can work on a best of.

1474
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,600
But still, go ahead and send in questions.

1475
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,960
Please, please, please, please.

1476
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,160
We gotta do three shows.

1477
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,480
We are bone dry in the Yahoo department.

1478
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,040
I need Emerald member Drew Davenport.

1479
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,160
I need Ira Ray.

1480
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,760
Are you out there, Ira Ray?

1481
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
How about Jacob Locker?

1482
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,600
Where you been, buddy?

1483
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,320
Krista Whalen.

1484
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,120
Krista Whalen.

1485
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,640
Guys, I need some help.

1486
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,240
I need some serious help.

1487
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,280
Also, we are in the final stages

1488
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,640
of planning for a live show in June.

1489
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,000
With our app next week,

1490
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,080
we may or may not be able to announce it

1491
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,720
when it's all done.

1492
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,400
So make sure you're following,

1493
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,160
check us out on Twitter

1494
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,920
and check mybrotherandmybrotherandme.com

1495
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,880
or maxfun.

1496
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,240
And we will announce that as soon as it's up

1497
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,680
and make sure everybody gets a chance

1498
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,160
to get tickets.

1499
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,720
It's gonna be in Los Angeles if all goes well.

1500
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,200
So make sure you stay tuned

1501
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
and pay attention to our Twitter feed.

1502
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,080
And we're trying to figure out a way to do more.

1503
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,760
That's all I'll say for now.

1504
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,440
That's all I'll say for now.

1505
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,560
But we're doing a lot already this year for us.

1506
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,600
For us, it's a lot.

1507
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,440
For a throwing shade, it's not very much.

1508
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,560
They're very good at this.

1509
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,120
We're very bad.

1510
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,640
We're very bad.

1511
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,600
Anyway, that's it for us.

1512
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,800
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1513
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,280
Thank you.

1514
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,160
You're all the best.

1515
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,720
We love you.

1516
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,360
Please share the show with a friend.

1517
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,480
Maybe not at this episode.

1518
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,520
It seemed kind of hit or miss,

1519
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,800
but like another one, a good one.

1520
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,000
Have them-

1521
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,320
One that's already proven to be a classic.

1522
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:50,800
Right.

1523
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,200
Who knows?

1524
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,920
Maybe this will ascend to the annals of comedy history.

1525
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,640
It's hard to say.

1526
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,960
But that's gonna-

1527
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,320
Thanks. I mean, thank you.

1528
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,960
Thank you.

1529
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,440
That's it.

1530
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,720
Griff, do you have a last yahoo?

1531
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,120
Yeah, let's-

1532
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,560
Oh, and before we go, hold on.

1533
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,280
Whoops.

1534
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,920
I got one more.

1535
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,760
Thanks to Max Fun.

1536
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,480
Yeah.

1537
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,320
On like episode like 32, we joined Max Fun,

1538
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,160
and it's just been super great since then.

1539
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,080
We wouldn't have been able to do, you know,

1540
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,880
the last 170-some episodes without them.

1541
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,000
If you don't listen to all the other Max Fun podcasts,

1542
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,480
go to maximumfun.org and fix that right now,

1543
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,440
because they're all amazing.

1544
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,840
And it's a super great place to be a part of.

1545
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,520
So thank you to them.

1546
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:27,920
Thank you.

1547
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,800
Thank you.

1548
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,840
Go listen to all the shows.

1549
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,120
Yes, definitely do that.

1550
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,240
This final yahoo was sent in by Michael R.

1551
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,960
Thank you, Michael.

1552
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,600
It's by yahoo answers user Glenn.

1553
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,480
Pretty hot boy name.

1554
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,480
Glenn asks,

1555
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,080
how to get Cosmo Kramer hair.

1556
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,240
I'm Justin McElroy.

1557
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1558
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1559
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,880
It's been my brother, my brother.

1560
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,000
May kiss your dad.

1561
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:01,600
Skull and lips.

1562
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,480
Maximumfun.org.

1563
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,520
Comedy and culture.

1564
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,640
Artist owned.

1565
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,600
Listener supported.

1566
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,480
Hey folks, this is Kevin Allison of the Max Fun podcast,

1567
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,040
Risk, where people tell true stories

1568
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,200
they never thought they'd dare to share.

1569
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,720
If you've never heard Risk,

1570
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,600
why not start with our 150th episode?

1571
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,960
It's an all star lineup of jaw dropping true stories

1572
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,320
from Aisha Tyler.

1573
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,680
This being the nineties,

1574
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,800
I was drinking malt liquor.

1575
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,240
Don't fuck you with your racist thoughts.

1576
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,400
You're all racist for laughing.

1577
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,400
Tom Lennon.

1578
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,040
Whenever I walk into a place that's called Mr. Binkies,

1579
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,680
I'm expecting Armenian bumblebee to be like,

1580
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,440
I got jack off pills for you.

1581
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,640
Yeah.

1582
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,600
Jay Moore.

1583
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,360
Me, public school in New Jersey.

1584
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,560
I didn't need to know anything

1585
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,840
because everybody knew you got pregnant

1586
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,040
by peeing in each other's butts.

1587
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,320
That's how we knew.

1588
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,360
Andy Dick.

1589
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,040
We've had a monogamous relationship for five years.

1590
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,880
I barely cheated on her.

1591
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,640
And The Daily Show's Jessica Williams.

1592
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,520
Oh my God.

1593
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,400
I have like this need to be responsible for some reason

1594
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,080
that doesn't really benefit me.

1595
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,880
So like, Jessica, clean it up.

1596
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,560
Look for Risk on iTunes

1597
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,680
or of course at MaximumFun.org.
