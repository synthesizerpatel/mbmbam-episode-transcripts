1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better it's better with you

8
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,540
It's better it's better with you

9
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Hello everybody and welcome to saw bones and marital to you are a misguided man

10
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,380
Just didn't hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,260
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle. It's probably

12
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,260
a little pregnant

13
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,740
That positive right now with triplets. I'm your middlest brother Travis the effervescent

14
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,980
Oh McElroy, do you stop saying your last name and it's like that's our fucking brand dog

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,940
No, but like that's how a flourish works like Peter the Great wasn't like I'm Peter Smith the great

16
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,600
That wasn't it

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,500
I'm Griffin McElroy this the youngest of them and

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,020
So glad so glad to be here. I just want to say I just want to take this opportunity. It's from a heart

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,780
I just want to apologize to you too. I've been watching a lot of in Canto lately

20
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,440
Yeah

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,920
and it makes me realize how hard it must have been for you guys to grow up in my shadow because I'm kind of like

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,540
A mix of like both Louisa and Isabel strong and perfect. Yes, exactly

23
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,900
And I'm it's making me realize now how much you guys must have felt like I don't like a Bruno

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
or

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,020
Maybe you know like even like a Mirabelle just completely no power

26
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,200
I felt more like one of the dirty rats that lived in the walls. That's just like nobody gave a shit

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,100
I feel like I feel like Kirk McElroy is the Bruno right like cuz we don't talk about Kirk

28
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,220
No, no and Kirk live in the walls

29
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
Little Griffin the rat. Yeah

30
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,660
He'll tell you that but don't ask him Kirk kicked ass

31
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,060
I did like kicking it with him cuz he was like way more loosey-goosey than the than the rest of y'all

32
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,260
He's kind of one of us that's pissed off about cancel culture. You know, I mean like

33
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,540
We curbs that vibe Kirk gives off. I do

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
crypto and he keeps calling it curbed oh

35
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,580
And then he moved out and he's he's high on the hog at this point

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,980
he has a dinner plate and he like always has it on him and I'm like, yeah, what's up and he's like

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,020
a Bitcoin and I say no and then he shows me that he did draw a dollar sign on it. Yeah, and there's

38
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,820
And that there is bite marks all over. Yeah that he put on that he put in there. That's Kirk

39
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,620
We've had so many fictional brothers, which is so cool whenever we post a picture of us with

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,580
Any person who's not us and they're like, oh, there's Kirk. So I've just stopped taking pictures of people who aren't you two?

41
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,300
Yeah, it confuses even my children in a big way

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,740
Especially if you do a photo of the two of us of two of us with one of them not in there

43
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,460
But somebody else is there and they're like man Travis looks fucking buck wild and it's like that's

44
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,740
Travis doesn't look as strong and perfect as he usually does. Yeah

45
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,920
He's not covered in donkeys and flowers like he normally is right because you're a fusion of the

46
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm not saying I'm literally a fusion Griffin. I'm like, it's not like there was some kind of like transporter accident and it combined

47
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,260
Luisa and Isabella, I'm saying that I represent

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,880
The strength and perfection of both of them. Yeah, you guys are struggling to come out from under my beautiful perfect shadow

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
I have an unrelated announcement. Okay, I

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,480
have an announcement for all the

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Listeners of this program all of them and the haters and the haters

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,560
No, just listeners. I now know uh-huh

53
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,920
That dr. Pepper. Yeah is making a berries and cream flavor. Oh, I have this information

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Okay, I have the information from you and you and you and you and you you and you

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
okay, I got it. Yeah, they're making a I

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,360
Let that go that part of myself is in the past

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,960
yeah, I am moving on to new projects much like

58
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,760
Gordon Lightfoot stop playing the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald because he didn't want it to overshadow the rest was great

59
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,040
It's the rest of Gort's gold the launch of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which was the prequel he wrote right and the model of the

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Will never crash

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,420
Nothing is ever going wrong with this bitch. Hey wait, Gordon

62
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
I don't think that's what we would say

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Terminology

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Gordo didn't make that one up

65
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,360
Gordo I think

66
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,640
further alienating our listeners, but no like

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Yep, I got it. You don't have to tweet it

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,000
But just it or Facebook it or or signal it or gab

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,160
I just have it. You don't put it on parlor for me anymore. I got it. No more periscopes. No, no, no

70
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Got it run to all of it

71
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,600
I got it

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,520
But Justin you can't shut down the pipeline that has served you so well like

73
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Charlotte combs never went to the bigger street or regulars and just like I get it. Somebody's murdered

74
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,400
It's just I can't I can't explain to you guys what it feels like I know we've addressed this topic before

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,160
But now when corporations are gonna make

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,640
Mondo money off of this and it's like thank you Justin. Thank you for this great corporate. Give it

77
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,320
It's like you're for to give you should have thought about that. Yeah before you accepted all that money from dr

78
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,680
Pepper to launch the berries and cream sounds on

79
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,480
TikTok so that they could launch this it's all been building for this and now you're biting the hand that feeds you and and drinks you

80
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,520
Um anyway, oh, you're just not gonna address. I'm not

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
berries and creamy

82
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,120
I'll just say this. I think that's that sounds like a kick-ass flavor. It sounds good. It sounds really good

83
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,840
They need it in a diet though. I don't I died. Dr. Pepper's

84
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,200
Berries and cream zero, I'd never drink anything else. I get out of here now Justin

85
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,320
You said you do other things and I would like you to list some of them, please. Yeah. Yeah

86
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,560
I get remember I used to do the doll thing. Yeah, that was like that. Yeah, okay. I got a

87
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,760
I

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,360
Got a shorty award in 2008 for what for a tweeter? Yeah, I was the AP

89
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Regional AP award winner for my business writing and the regional AP Awards

90
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,480
I had a really good Facebook memory about that back from 2008 that you posted on my Facebook wall a link to your shorty award and

91
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,000
You said something like eat my balls or something. Yeah, it was we both up for that

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
I don't think we were both up for it

93
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,280
But I think I know word for how good a single tweet was it's so fun when you think about how different

94
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,720
things things were what is that 14 years ago that you won a shorty award and you were the type of person that went on your

95
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
younger brother's Facebook wall and posted a

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,320
Link to your shorty award and just said eat my balls

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,900
Different time. I will say though in 2008 that could have been a reference to the hit meme

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,040
About different characters eating your balls. Yeah, it definitely was that but still I don't think that changes the point that the odds were a different

99
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,800
Time would you do that now Justin?

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Would you win an award for a tweet you wrote and then go on Griffin's Facebook page and post a link to that award? I

101
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,720
Think you'd probably get like a scarf my ass. Oh

102
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
Yeah

103
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,720
Scarf huff my farts kind of deal. Yeah, it's huff my farts harder edge

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Seems like much more of a commitment like if someone's gonna eat some balls versing huffing farts huffing farts could almost be a passive

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Sorry, I found it. This was from February 12 2009 and Justin posted a link to a CNN article about the Shorty Awards, which

106
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:12,040
Wow, it's pretty wild and he just put any just wrote and on his younger brother's wall on Facebook for everyone to see

107
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
Suck on this Wow

108
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,480
Suck on this CNN article that doesn't even load anymore

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
I

110
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't know man, you've been rooting against me like I don't remember this

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
working for

112
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Polygon or joystick at that point. It's

113
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
It's I forget the timeline, but I did I guess that made me feel small Justin

114
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
I just want to say there's a part of me

115
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,240
Why didn't you post on my wall that I could suck on your shorty award was I not on the social media at this point?

116
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Was I not probably not you're too busy in college or something. I listen in 2009 Justin. I was 24

117
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Yeah, you did go back there for a bit. Oh, yeah. Oh wait. I did didn't I did? Yeah, you did

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Oh you did. Yeah, I did go back to college for a while. That might be true. God good times

119
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,800
Thanks everybody for strolling down this memory lane with us. Yeah, that's gonna do it for us this week's folks

120
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,900
Oh, no, no, we're ahead of I sure we're gonna help people. Yeah, okay

121
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm gonna visit my sister next month. And while I'm there I use her guest room

122
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Yeah, one problem her sheets suck. They feel like burlap. Would it be rude to gift her sheets for the guest bed or

123
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,720
Any advice y'all could give thanks. That's from sleepless in San Antonio

124
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,480
Now listen it is it is

125
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Fine to give a host a gift. So you could be like and I brought my own sheets now. Here's the thing

126
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
Unless your your sister is completely obtuse

127
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,520
It will be pretty obvious. Yeah, pretty clear. I brought these sheets for me to sleep on

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Go ahead and put them on now, please

129
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
I'll wait

130
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,880
It can't be a preference thing, right?

131
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,680
I'd like I prefer burlap like nobody I it they've got to be sleeping on some

132
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,840
Silky stuff and yeah, I don't think that I just don't think they care. Yeah, they're it's a guest bed

133
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,800
It's getting used to what maybe maybe once a month. Maybe probably never used

134
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,320
I mean, it's a very good chance that she doesn't know see this is why drug communication is so important

135
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,800
You got to go in and just say hey, I I love you as a person your guest bed sheets are trash

136
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,240
I mean, they're trash. That's one that's one option

137
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,200
another option is you show up day one and you're like ghost costumes and

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
Then you have her put on those and so she can feel it all over her body

139
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,520
And then when you guys are done playing ghost costumes and scaring people around the neighborhood saying that you're a ghost

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
She can be like, you know what?

141
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,680
I just had these on my body when I was pretending to be a ghost earlier and they suck

142
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,700
They're terrible. It doesn't matter because there will be holes cut in them. The problem has solved itself with ghost costume now

143
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,540
Hold on. It depends where the holes are put because what two holes that's gonna stop you from using sheets. Come on

144
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:09,340
Mr. Moneybags, I didn't realize that two holes was all it took before you stopped using sheets

145
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,580
No, my my child my also you're not using fitted sheets for those costumes Justin

146
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,380
You'll look like a sack of cash look like grimace

147
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,140
Okay, that's here. That's a good point

148
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,220
You look like a bruised up sack of testicles like grimace and maybe maybe you could help in this

149
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,140
So you get the sheets and you throw them in to the washing machine with some shoes?

150
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:40,080
Okay, and fabric softener and then you just run them, you know, you run over that shit. Maybe that could like

151
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,700
Soften them up a little bit. So it's a little more pleasant for you

152
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,540
I'm just saying that like if someone came to me if

153
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,700
If one of my brothers the one that I loved the most he came to my house and said hey

154
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah

155
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,380
I think fabric softener works. I

156
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,580
Assume it's acid that breaks down the bonds

157
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,660
I have to be involved in it. It doesn't actually soften it though. It's not magic. I mean it it does softer

158
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,060
So like why do I have to be involved in that? I thought I just reduced static. No

159
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Are you whoa?

160
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,380
Are you serious? What did you okay when you when you put a sheet in the dryer? What's that for?

161
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,580
Well, I I use woolen balls in the dryer. Trust me. I bet you do. What's that supposed to mean, sir?

162
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,620
Nasty dog. Anyway, I'm an adult after works. That's proven. Go ahead Travis

163
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,180
I'm just saying that if the brother that I love the most which now might be evident

164
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,460
Came to my house and said hey these sheets on your guest bed suck

165
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,900
And I brought you other ones to put on there and I'll put them on myself. I'd be like, okay

166
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:54,160
I don't care like it's like yes, but it really has zero impact on me. And in fact of anything, this is a net gain

167
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,540
Because you brought the sheets you put them on it cost me nothing

168
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,440
You don't you don't even have to you don't even have to say against this sheet

169
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:09,000
You don't have to say anything bad against the sheets. Hey Becky. I hate to be a pain, but my doctor said

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,840
I have Paragribitis. I have to use these prescriptions

171
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,320
Hey, I got special sheets that I'm gonna leave here. There's special sheets that I'll leave here

172
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm leaving them everywhere. I could possibly sleep but because of the Paragribitis I have I have to use these prescription sheets

173
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,640
There's also a good chance you could just change out the sheets and like secret away the old sheets and your sister would never

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,480
Know never know if anything your sister might one day years from now

175
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,000
Approach this to change the sheets on the guest bed and think are these the sheets I put on the guest bed

176
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know. I don't mind

177
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
unless

178
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Unless your sister's just crazy about these Shrek ass sheets. Oh, I love exfoliating my guests. Yeah

179
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,920
Hey, can I approach the wizard? I wish you were cool

180
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,400
We got a this one was sent in by so many people and it's it is how to make a Star Wars movie. Oh

181
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,400
Well, oh, yeah. Yeah, just for just for fun

182
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,360
You might like to toy around with making the next big episode in the Star Wars saga using your own home filming gear

183
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
I would it won't be as spectacular as Hollywood's special effects

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,040
But you assume but provided you focus on the fun of making a movie and use your creativity

185
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,600
You'll enjoy the experience and learn things in the process

186
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,840
Awesome. It probably won't be the next big episode in the Star Wars saga

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,360
So you did I feel like you opened with a pretty huge salvo there of like do you want to be Borj Lucas?

188
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,440
And then you like immediately dipped out of that

189
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,280
But I do like that they used they couched it though by saying it probably won't they weren't like this

190
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,000
Definitely won't be the neck. They're like, hey, listen, I'm a fucking no man. Yeah, maybe

191
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Listen, I'm gonna be a friend. It probably won't let's I don't know. Listen, we can do this ourselves

192
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,080
This can be a fun little game that we play. So step one think up some characters

193
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,080
You can't do anything until you got a couple main characters. You don't have to flesh it all out now

194
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,960
Just have enough to build a story around a good guy and a bad guy

195
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Just make sure you have enough to start your plot

196
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,160
Now obviously we could also I mean if it's a next in the series we could use some of the ones society there

197
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
This is Chewie's big movie, you know what I mean?

198
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,840
Like that guy hasn't gotten enough to do right we start the problem is if you do that

199
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:35,720
Then you get in trouble with Lucas and okay come up with new guys a new good guy a new bad guy. Okay? Boy, I'll leave you right alone

200
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,880
spork

201
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
No

202
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,320
Spork magnificence. The first name has to be normal, right?

203
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,560
Josh my Josh is great. Yeah, Josh

204
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,480
G

205
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,000
e o s a yeah, right. Yeah

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's cool

207
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,180
That's how they spell it on Bova bean, which is the yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This one's Josh dawn Tretter

208
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,160
John

209
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,560
Now that's hitting me a little fantasy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What about

210
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,320
It's got to be something celestial and then a mode of transport

211
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Yeah

212
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,200
Josh Sun truck

213
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,760
Josh Sun runner Sun trucker

214
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Josh Sumner's cool. That's

215
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,060
Pretty good way of making a cool name

216
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,560
Fine it's John John Josh Sun runner

217
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, then we can make if you want we can make the villain like that's John

218
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Trucker and it's very confusing. They're always getting confused everywhere. They go. Dr

219
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,960
Lucas made it easy on us for this one cuz first name is Darth and then the second word is just a nasty sounding word

220
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,680
So Josh Sun runner hates his dad Darth

221
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
It can't be his dad. That's taken

222
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,720
Darth

223
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
Darth

224
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,700
Dark, this is the bad guy. Yeah, dark. What's the good guy? Josh Sun runner? Josh Sun runner?

225
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Darth flippin's

226
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,660
Vader you know what I mean? Like it's gotta be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Darth scab. Darth shit scan

227
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,380
Dar dar dar dar

228
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
well, you can't be Darn-der-dar

229
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,720
Dar-dar Darn-der-dar Dar-dar-dar Dar-dar-dar Dar-dar Dar Denar. Darf Dar Dar sauce

230
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Will Dr. Dar I

231
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,960
See your forces as powerful as my

232
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Wait, is this another villain talking to Darth Dardar?

233
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Are these two villains fighting to see who gets to be Josh Sunrunner's dad?

234
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Your mother loves me more, I want to be your new dad.

235
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Yes, so this is like we're combining Star Wars and Daddy's Home at this point.

236
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Okay, so from Darth?

237
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Dardar-dardar-dardar-dardar. No, please call me Darth Dardar for short.

238
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Darth Dardar versus Darth Scabulous or something.

239
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Scabulous.

241
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Darth Scabulous.

242
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Darth Hematoma.

243
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Darth Scabulov.

244
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh, love is a cool one to put in there.

245
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Dark Scabulose.

246
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Okay, we can agree that dark Scabulov is the cool one, right?

247
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
It's not Darth Dardar.

248
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
We're rooting for Darth Scabulov.

249
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Well now, don't assume whom I'm rooting for, Justin.

250
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm rooting for the underdog.

251
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
You gotta keep the fuel under the fire

252
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
under the writer's room.

253
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
And that's us right now, so let's keep it going.

254
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
Who's writing this down?

255
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,320
Step two, the wiki.

256
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,160
Step two, come up with a plot.

257
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,560
And can we agree that Marisa Tomei's playing the mom?

258
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Can we just establish that now?

259
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
Well, I'm not casting her right now.

260
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm just in this room.

261
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,280
Oh my god.

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,520
Okay, but I can't picture it with-

263
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
Okay.

264
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,720
Also, there's no moms in Star Wars.

265
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
Only aunts.

266
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,680
That's, okay.

267
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,120
And we can't make Marisa Tomei another aunt.

268
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,960
That is true.

269
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
You know what I mean?

270
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,620
That is true.

271
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,460
Okay, so come up with a plot.

272
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,300
Awesome.

273
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,140
Start with the main idea. Got that.

274
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,120
The main conflict of the movie.

275
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
We got that.

276
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,140
These two Darths want to beat Josh's dad.

277
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,400
Next, think of some things that could happen along the way.

278
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay, okay.

279
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,760
They take him out for a drive in the pod racer.

280
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
Yeah.

281
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,180
No, they take him to a pod race.

282
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,840
But Darth Scabulov bets on the pod races.

283
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,680
Awesome.

284
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,200
And that's good or bad?

285
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,440
We don't like that.

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
Oh, we don't like that.

287
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,120
Well, it's kind of up to the-

288
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,940
Yeah.

289
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,800
Oh, and through a series of misunderstandings,

290
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,540
Darth Dardar is in the race.

291
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,380
Oh, that's funny.

292
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,200
He shouldn't be.

293
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,040
He shouldn't be.

294
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
He was looking for the bathroom

295
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
and he went in the wrong door

296
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,040
and suddenly he's out there in the pod race.

297
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,280
Okay, focus on a theme of your own.

298
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,960
You might want to make it really original,

299
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,800
like the Great Sith War or the New Republic.

300
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
No, that's too big.

301
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,520
That's too much, like that's too much lore for me.

302
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Yeah.

303
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
I like this.

304
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,120
I want to establish that this is a quiet time

305
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
in this galaxy, far, far away.

306
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,120
Right? Sure.

307
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Everything's pretty much,

308
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm not even going to say simmering at this point.

309
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,920
This is just like, everyone's like,

310
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,520
well, I don't feel like doing anything right now.

311
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,800
So the Darths have some free time for romance.

312
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeah, to fuck around.

313
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
Okay, so step three is-

314
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,720
They're not fucking around, Griffin.

315
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,800
They're looking for love.

316
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,500
Right, and all the wrong places.

317
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,960
And this next step is going to really be in our wheelhouse

318
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,240
because it's the literal next step

319
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
in this WikiHow article.

320
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
And it does say, make it funny.

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
Oh, hell yeah.

322
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,400
Humor will improve the amateur-

323
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,920
Keep your grades up.

324
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Keep your grades up, make it funny.

325
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,040
It'll improve the amateur moving,

326
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,800
allowing for much forgiveness

327
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,320
for the amateur setting and storyline.

328
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,000
Add a few jokes and punchlines to your movie.

329
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
It wouldn't be a good one without it.

330
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
Make sure that you understand people's styles

331
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,240
and make the humor fit each of them.

332
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,280
Here's an example scene they have.

333
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,100
Rebel 1 and Rebel 2 are walking.

334
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,420
Rebel 1 collapses.

335
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,440
Rebel 2 calls for his commanding officer.

336
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,800
Rebel 2, sir, my partner collapsed and is not breathing.

337
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,640
What should I do?

338
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,680
Commander, make sure he is dead, then tell me.

339
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
Rebel 2 shoots Rebel 1.

340
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
Rebel 2, now what?

341
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh my God.

342
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,120
That's a killer. Wow.

343
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,400
That person's dead now. Hey, can I punch up that joke?

344
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,240
Yeah.

345
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
Rebel 1 collapses.

346
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,320
Rebel 2, I think he's dying.

347
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,000
Rebel 1, nah, it's just I was sleepy and I shit my pants.

348
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Okay. Funny.

349
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,920
That's funny to me too.

350
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,400
You could also have Josh Stargitter.

351
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
Sunrunner. I forgot his name.

352
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Starrunner come up and everybody's like,

353
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,280
wow, fucked up, we just saw a murder on the screen.

354
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
But then Josh Sunrunner comes up

355
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
and takes the laser out of him.

356
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
And now he's okay again.

357
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh my God.

358
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,840
Do you know what I mean?

359
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,760
Because then that way you do get the really funny joke

360
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,580
that they come up with,

361
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,840
but you don't have to feel guilty about it

362
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,360
because you watched someone die.

363
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Oh, okay.

364
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Because he took the laser out.

365
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
Uh-huh.

366
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,600
So that's cool.

367
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
And you might be saying like that,

368
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,960
but that's not an established Star Wars power.

369
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,240
And to that, I would say, watch anything.

370
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,020
Watch any Star Wars shit that's come out

371
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,320
for the last 10 years, guys.

372
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,520
We're just having fun with it at this point.

373
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,360
Yeah.

374
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,760
Oh, this does occur to me, Griffin,

375
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,000
because we hadn't established,

376
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,680
this is probably knowing Star Wars canon,

377
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
something we should have decided early on.

378
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Yeah, sure.

379
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,560
Is Josh a chosen one of some sort?

380
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,400
Of course.

381
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said on this show.

382
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Yeah, of course he is.

383
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,160
Of course he is, yeah.

384
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,360
So Josh, and also he can turn into a wolf.

385
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,200
Part four.

386
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,080
Hell yeah, dude.

387
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,920
Produces script.

388
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, dude.

389
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,680
Like a force wolf?

390
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,380
Yeah, of course it's a force wolf, Travis.

391
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,640
That's the second dumbest thing you've said.

392
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,480
Wait, before we move on,

393
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,640
what have we established so far?

394
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,440
Josh Sunrunner is a chosen one.

395
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
He is a chosen one.

396
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,600
He is a chosen one.

397
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,440
He is a chosen one.

398
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,360
He is the nephew of.

399
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,880
He's got a, there has to be some,

400
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,380
like you gotta have something set up

401
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,000
so that in episode, like the third or fourth episode

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
of this show, like fucking Greedo walks in

403
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,640
and everyone's like, ooh!

404
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
And that's them nutting.

405
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,560
Yeah, he's Grogu's nephew.

406
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,400
He's Grogu's.

407
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,220
No, no, no, no, no.

408
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,840
I don't want tied up with the Mandalorian-verse.

409
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,680
Like.

410
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah, it's gotta be its own.

411
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,360
Ooh, even though Timothy Olyphant

412
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,860
is in the Mandalorian-verse.

413
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,960
That's great.

414
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't know why that changes the point, like.

415
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
Well, he's gonna come in at the end

416
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,520
and sweep the mother-aunt off her feet.

417
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
Is he maybe related to Kit Fisto or something?

418
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,140
Oh yeah, or Porkins?

419
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,980
Yeah.

420
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,080
Oh, yeah.

421
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,100
Wedge Antilles, perhaps?

422
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,320
Yeah, he's the Death Star's grandpa.

423
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,400
Anyway, and then the Death Star shows up in the sky

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,120
and everyone's like, oh yeah, baby!

425
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,520
I love that big ship.

426
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,160
He's half, well, he's half-Jawa.

427
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,000
He's half-Jawa, he's half-Jawa.

428
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,820
He's half-Jawa.

429
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,660
All right, all right.

430
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,500
He's half-Jawa.

431
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,320
Griffin, you're an architect

432
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,880
in the Star Wars universe specifically with regards to Jawa.

433
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,020
Yeah, I got my fingers all over the Jawa pulse.

434
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,120
Produce a script.

435
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
You'll need this for the actors to follow up.

436
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh, well, fuck, I didn't know

437
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,940
that was part of writing a movie.

438
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,280
Yeah, it starts to get less fun.

439
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,240
Do you know how fucked up it is

440
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,280
that Griffin's here doing this

441
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,720
and he did actually write

442
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,280
it's part of the Star Wars extended universe?

443
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Yeah, that's why I'm so good at this part.

444
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
Oh, okay, that makes perfect sense.

445
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,440
Yeah.

446
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
Well, then just break off a couple lines, Griffin,

447
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,040
that feel inherently Star Wars.

448
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,880
You know what I mean?

449
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Like from the script?

450
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,120
Yeah, like what's something that,

451
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,160
because listen, you can't just be like,

452
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,200
hey, how's it going, man?

453
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,040
That's not what someone in Star Wars would say.

454
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,880
Sure, sure, sure.

455
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,700
So, like, what's a Star Wars-y way there?

456
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay, so this is like, episode, this is the pilot.

457
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,560
Yeah.

458
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,380
Because I just decided it's on Disney Plus,

459
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,100
this series, and it's not a movie.

460
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,920
And Josh Sonaraj is like, I just feel something calling.

461
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,820
And he's got like a British accent, right?

462
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,320
So he's like, I feel something.

463
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,360
How old is he?

464
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,920
He's 31.

465
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,760
Okay.

466
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,360
I feel something calling to me from the stars.

467
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,000
Is that Michael Caine?

468
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,080
Let me finish.

469
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,920
Okay.

470
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,120
I feel the stars, there's something in there

471
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,760
moving for me, and I can feel the power grow.

472
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,440
Is that fucking Greedo?

473
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,280
Oh!

474
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,440
Now, wait, is that the sound of Josh nutting

475
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,280
over seeing Greedo?

476
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
No, it's him trying to get into a wolf.

477
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
Oh, right, of course.

478
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
That happens when he nuts.

479
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Let's get some humor in there.

480
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,040
He turns into a wolf when he nuts, like in Teen Wolf.

481
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, and at this point, I think I've decided

482
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,360
we shouldn't do the two dads thing.

483
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,200
Oh, okay.

484
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Okay, which of the Darceel are you rid of?

485
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Probably Dar-Da-Dar, because that's not gonna,

486
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,000
we can't make toys of him.

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
Can it be an unrelated storyline

488
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,480
that is happening off-screen that people keep waiting

489
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
for it to intersect?

490
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,440
People love the books.

491
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,100
It doesn't even have to be B, I mean, it could be D.

492
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,800
Extras, remember, Star Wars is full of extras.

493
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Gotta find extras.

494
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,920
Hey, guys, we're doing this kick-ass movie

495
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
about, can I see the script?

496
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,800
Well, we've got one line written so far.

497
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,640
Yeah.

498
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,640
And we've made some major cuts.

499
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
But listen, we-

500
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,320
Yeah!

501
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,480
Okay, I know, I get it, the problems

502
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,440
with only having one line, but if you're like,

503
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,800
be in my movie, and the one line is-

504
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
Kicks ass like that.

505
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,880
I feel something calling to me from the stars.

506
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,400
Is that Greedo, a wolf howl?

507
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah.

508
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,060
Like, I'm in.

509
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,840
You can sell that shit in the room.

510
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,880
You don't have to give a script to the extras.

511
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,720
They don't have lines.

512
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,200
No way, no way.

513
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
They just are gonna react to Josh turning into a wolf,

514
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,320
and that's what we're selling this series on.

515
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,160
It's first full, oh my God, this next part beats ass.

516
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,840
All right, this is creating the backdrop and effects, okay?

517
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,320
Part one, make a set.

518
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,280
You'll need at least one set to film against.

519
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,120
Yeah.

520
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,780
If you live near a city or in one,

521
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,000
you could make it in Coruscant.

522
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,840
Awesome.

523
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,680
Huh.

524
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,080
What, where do you live?

525
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,920
Cleveland.

526
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,640
You can make Cleveland look like Coruscant.

527
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,480
Easy.

528
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,300
Yeah.

529
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,140
Easy.

530
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,960
One to one.

531
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
Just film the tops of the buildings, one to one.

532
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,180
If you live in the woods, it would be a good idea

533
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,760
to make the movie in Kashyyyk or indoor.

534
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
Indoor.

535
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,420
Yeah, of course.

536
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,260
Yes, obviously.

537
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,080
Obviously, you didn't need as many.

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,020
If you live in Arizona, in parentheses, desert,

539
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,720
you could make it on Tatooine.

540
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
Awesome.

541
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,380
If you're in the mountains-

542
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,760
But I wanna create a new planet.

543
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,720
Mountains can be Hoth, big field can be Naboo.

544
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,240
If you live near a swamp, make it Dagobah.

545
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Welcome.

546
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
This is my planet, Backyardia.

547
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,880
I mean, it looks just like it's someone's backyard.

548
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,620
And these are the Backyardigans.

549
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,460
Kip-kip.

550
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,360
I have long been the mayor of Kroger parking lot,

551
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,400
but I am thrilled.

552
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,840
You've made this long journey, Sunrunner.

553
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
And it looks like they're asking us to leave

554
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,080
because we didn't acquire any permits.

555
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,480
Let us move to mom's basement here.

556
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,000
It's a storm trooper.

557
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,600
My name is Carl.

558
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,800
Get out of my fucking Kroger's.

559
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,300
Get out of my Kroger's.

560
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,920
Do you wanna be in my movie?

561
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
Yeah?

562
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,680
Of course.

563
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,440
There's a lot of lines in this article

564
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,680
that beat absolute ass.

565
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,220
And this is another one.

566
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,120
Step three, find suitable music.

567
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,600
You can play it on your guitar,

568
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,520
but you can make it better by adding the real deal.

569
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,360
Hell yeah.

570
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,800
What?

571
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
Hell yeah, dude.

572
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,960
Get some real jizz in there.

573
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
Get some real space jizz in there would be so cool.

574
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
But how much cooler would Star Wars have been

575
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
if it was like,

576
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,460
down to the down, down, squirrely, woo, woo, woo.

577
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,300
And people would be like,

578
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,160
well, this isn't the real deal music

579
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,240
because it's just a guitar, but damn.

580
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,080
That's good.

581
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,900
But what if it was more like,

582
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,080
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

583
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,920
Oh, that's good.

584
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,480
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

585
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,000
Do you think that George went to John,

586
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,960
did John Williams do the Star Wars?

587
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,780
He did, right?

588
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,620
He did some of it.

589
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,460
He did some of it.

590
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,760
And then he was like, so he,

591
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,600
and George was like,

592
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,960
so are we new to music for this scene in a bar?

593
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,280
And then John Williams was like,

594
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,600
That's a really good George Lucas.

595
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,440
Thanks.

596
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
And John Williams was like,

597
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,960
okay, I think it'll be like,

598
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,320
buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

599
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,220
And then George Lucas was like,

600
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,780
no, make it stupid.

601
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,720
Like, beep, beep, beep, beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

602
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,520
Make it sound like a child's toy.

603
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,160
Make a dumb, like dumb jizz.

604
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,000
What?

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,260
What'd you call it, George?

606
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,600
Did you mean to say jazz?

607
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,240
Uh, no, I meant jizz.

608
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
I wasn't thinking of jizz when I said that.

609
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
That's what they call it in space.

610
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,480
Wait, George, you're saying that they call music jizz

611
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,200
and say, yeah, I'm George Lucas.

612
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,280
I gotta go work on Howard the Duck.

613
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,800
The only thing wilder than the moment

614
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,480
that a person learns that George Lucas called the music jizz

615
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
is the music that George,

616
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
is the moment that George Lucas learns

617
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,880
that semen is called jizz.

618
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,760
That would be the only thing wilder than-

619
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,580
That's it too?

620
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,860
Is it too late to, oh, what's that?

621
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,280
People will only know about it

622
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,440
if I talk about it in interviews?

623
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Well, I can't stop myself from talking about jizz.

624
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
I got it.

625
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,720
When you've got jizz in your heart,

626
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,220
you've gotta let it out.

627
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,040
What's a funny story, isn't it?

628
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
Get some actors.

629
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,280
Remember how Harrison Ford flew the Millennium Falcon

630
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,600
in circles just to lose the Imperials in the asteroid field

631
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,680
and the Empire Strikes Back?

632
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,920
Well- Spoilers.

633
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,960
Well, to get characters with good personality like Solo,

634
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
you need actors with equally good personalities.

635
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
Why do you have to tell us- So Tom Holland.

636
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,720
Tom Holland's, his brother.

637
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,160
Get Tom Holland, get Marisa Tomei.

638
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
We're gonna get Robert Downey Jr.

639
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes.

640
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,360
Get Zendaya in there.

641
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,600
And of course, what would the film be

642
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,840
with old Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe?

643
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
We gotta have him.

644
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
We need him.

645
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,860
Gotta get Willem.

646
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,700
This is the thing,

647
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,540
because not a lot of people-

648
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,260
Now wait, now stop the show.

649
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,280
Griffin just said Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe.

650
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Yeah.

651
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,960
That's what it is.

652
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
It can't be the other way.

653
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,640
I think the sentence I said was,

654
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,880
what would the film be with Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe?

655
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,320
As if like, I was pitching that to you guys.

656
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,640
Yeah, you're pitching a parody of your own movie

657
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,480
that you haven't made.

658
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I love this.

659
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,920
The rest of this article kind of-

660
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,240
I think it might go a little something like,

661
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,800
now give me a job that Willem Dafoe might not normally have.

662
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
Right.

663
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,440
I'm hearing sex therapist.

664
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,040
The rest of this article is boring,

665
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,960
except for there's one last step that says,

666
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,120
create the DVD.

667
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
Once you're satisfied,

668
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,080
send the movie to a menu making program like IDVD

669
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,200
or others that work for you.

670
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Make a cool menu design,

671
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,760
then burn your movie to the disc.

672
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,920
This is your prototype.

673
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
If you're happy with your movie,

674
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,080
then burn some more.

675
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,280
Sell them on the street or something.

676
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,360
Maybe make a trailer.

677
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,040
If someone came up to you on the street and was like,

678
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,040
hey, do you want to buy for $10 the Star Wars movie I made?

679
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,480
The answer to that will never be no.

680
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,520
It would, yes.

681
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
I would actually rather do that

682
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,840
than if someone says like,

683
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,560
I have a bootleg copy of a real Star Wars DVD

684
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,520
for like 10 bucks.

685
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,680
Versus one I made from scratch,

686
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,680
starring Willem Dafoe as himself as Josh's Sunrunner.

687
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,120
His last, we just don't,

688
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
I'm changing the movie again,

689
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,280
cause I do feel like I'm taking a sort of

690
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,840
like directorial role at this point.

691
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,680
Does it feel that way?

692
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,520
I would say more,

693
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,200
it feels more like an executive producer to me, but.

694
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,040
Yeah, more of an EP.

695
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,760
Well, here's what I'm thinking is that.

696
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,800
Cause you're constantly kind of

697
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,640
butting in.

698
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,480
Yeah, sure.

699
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,040
Listen, I'm happy just being there to shepherd

700
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,400
what I consider now my baby.

701
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, yeah, but I've.

702
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
As the writer.

703
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,280
I got my hands on the scissors.

704
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,800
We can co-make it, Trav.

705
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,640
We can be like the Russo.

706
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,600
Did you almost call your brother Charlie?

707
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,080
No, Travis Russo.

708
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
Yeah.

709
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,760
And Justin Russo.

710
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,580
Like the Russo brothers.

711
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,600
Yeah, and I can be like a powerful movie producer.

712
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,520
And there's honestly only,

713
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,000
I can't think of too many of them.

714
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,040
And a lot of them are pretty bad people.

715
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,880
Pieces of shit.

716
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,720
Yeah.

717
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,560
So let me just say that.

718
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,280
Are you Kevin Feige?

719
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, let me do say this.

720
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,800
No last name for the protagonist.

721
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,080
He's just Josh.

722
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,920
No, I don't like that.

723
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,680
Hey Justin, can you join me over here in my trailer?

724
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah, I'd love to.

725
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,360
Yeah, I'm sure.

726
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,200
And Willem Dafoe as Josh.

727
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,440
I think we gotta cut Griffin out.

728
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,400
No, wait, we gotta give him a different name.

729
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,120
We gotta give who a different name?

730
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,960
Griffin.

731
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,780
You can't just be Griffin.

732
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,620
That's our brother.

733
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,960
He's the producer of the movie.

734
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,720
Yeah, we gotta cut him out.

735
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,560
He needs a new character though.

736
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,440
So we're gonna give Griffin a character

737
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,720
and then cut that character out of the movie?

738
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,200
No, no.

739
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,040
I'm saying in the rich fiction we're developing,

740
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,360
Griffin can't just be Griffin.

741
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,120
Okay, Josh too.

742
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,800
We gotta cut Josh too.

743
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,060
Okay, yeah, I agree.

744
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,280
Let's go back out of our trailer.

745
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,560
Okay, hey, do you wanna handle it?

746
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,900
What'd you just drink?

747
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,740
I'll take care of it.

748
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,580
Griffin.

749
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,840
What do you guys think about Pete Davidson

750
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,960
as a new sort of-

751
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,760
Fuck, wait, hold on, Justin, come back over here.

752
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,360
That's a really, it's a really good suggestion.

753
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,200
It's really good.

754
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,020
It's really good.

755
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,860
Let me talk to Griffin.

756
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,700
Griffin, hey, Griffin.

757
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,960
And he would be like a hutt, like a crazy hutt.

758
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,480
Oh wait, Justin, step back over here.

759
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,320
I don't like that.

760
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
I don't think, I don't want,

761
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,120
I want Pete in the movie obviously, but not as a hutt.

762
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,740
That's it, I'm striking out on my own.

763
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,580
What?

764
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,420
It's a solo project now.

765
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,240
No, they already made solo.

766
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm producing and directing.

767
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,080
This is my body of evidence.

768
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,920
This is my-

769
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,520
I'm gonna make my own, then I'm making my own movie.

770
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
Okay, we'll run them next to each other simultaneously.

771
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,960
Hey, we need to take a quick break.

772
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,520
And then when we get, we're gonna go to the Money Zone

773
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,540
is what is gonna happen.

774
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,080
I mean, that's what's happening.

775
00:34:45,080 --> 00:35:00,360
Oh, I say that might just sound like Babble to you,

776
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,520
but I was actually speaking a foreign language.

777
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,400
And that's because I learned it on Babble.

778
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,160
This is not, that is not a ringing endorsement

779
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,720
for this actual advertiser.

780
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,040
Yeah, unless you're speaking, are you speaking Atlantean?

781
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,360
It's an actual service.

782
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,000
Because I can say it's so edifying

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,640
to learn another language.

784
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,520
It can make travel more fun.

785
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,560
It could just keep the fucking neurons firing.

786
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,400
You know what I mean?

787
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
Just like make you feel like you're making progress

788
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,640
in your life, even though some other things

789
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
might've run aground, you know?

790
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,520
And if one of your other friends knows the language,

791
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,160
you can bad mouth a third friend in front of their face

792
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,280
and they'd never know.

793
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,120
That's so funny.

794
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,080
Babble's 15 minute lessons make it the perfect way

795
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,000
to learn a new language on the go.

796
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,600
Choose from 14 different languages,

797
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,040
including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Pig Latin.

798
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,880
Plus-

799
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Just learn them all at once.

800
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,560
That's what I did.

801
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,400
Just learn them all at once.

802
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,880
Babble's speech recognition technology

803
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,800
helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent.

804
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,560
Yes, I studied English there.

805
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,000

806
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,480

Hey, Griffin.

815
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,520
Yeah.

816
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,280
It just seems like you got a lot on your mind.

817
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
No, I'm doing great, actually.

818
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,160
Yeah?

819
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,720
Yeah, I'm having a pretty good day.

820
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,640
Okay, cause you seem pretty stressed out.

821
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,880
Seem to be stressed out, yeah.

822
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
No, guys, I'm doing great.

823
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,840
Well, why don't you take a moment

824
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
and just check in with yourself, Griffin?

825
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,920
Don't need to.

826
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm awesome right now, actually.

827
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,280
Oh, God.

828
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
He's really freaking out.

829
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,400
Griffin, have you considered maybe doing like Calm

830
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,720
to like clear your head

831
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,160

Oh, well, let me try it.

838
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,600
Okay.

839
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,320
Oh, yeah, I was fucked up.

840
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,840
Yeah, I knew it.

841
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,280
I was saying that I was actually good,

842
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,200
but as it turns out, I was pretty fucked up.

843
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,440

862
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Hi, I'm looking for a movie.

863
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh, I got you.

864
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,840
There's that new foreign film with the time travel.

865
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,080
There's an amazing documentary

866
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,720
about queer history on streaming.

867
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,400
Have I told you about this classic

868
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,040
where giant robots fight?

869
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,880
Or there's that one that most critics hated,

870
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,720
but I thought it was actually pretty good.

871
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,160
Ooh, I know the one with the huge car chase.

872
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,480
And then there's that scene

873
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,320
where the car jumps over the submarine.

874
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
Wow, who are you eclectic movie experts?

875
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Well, I'm Evie Whiteyway.

876
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm Drea Clark.

877
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,120
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

878
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,320
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

879
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,880
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

880
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,960
And together we host the movie podcast, Maximum Film.

881
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,800
New episodes every week on MaximumFun.org.

882
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,680
And you actually just walked into our recording booth.

883
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,520
Oh, weird.

884
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,720
Sorry, I thought this was a video store.

885
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,000
You seem like a lady with a lot of problems.

886
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,960
Well, Manolo, we have a show to promote.

887
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
It's called Dr. Game Show.

888
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,280
It's a family-friendly podcast

889
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,640
where listeners submit games

890
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,080
and we play them with callers from around the world.

891
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,160
Oh, sounds good.

892
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,600
New episodes happen every other Wednesday

893
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,480
on MaximumFun.org.

894
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,560
It's a fast and loose oasis

895
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,400
of absurd innocence and naivete.

896
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Are you writing a poem?

897
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,000
No, I'm just saying things from my memory.

898
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,200
And it's a nice break from reality.

899
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,160
Is that, are we allowed to say that?

900
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,640
I don't know, it sounds bad.

901
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,240
It comes with a 100% happiness guarantee.

902
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,080
It does not.

903
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,440
Come for the games and stay for the chaos.

904
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,840
I have to do my laundry at a laundromat.

905
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,880
And I often find that people will leave their clothes

906
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
in the dryer long after they're finished.

907
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,080
And I need that dryer.

908
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,440
You don't mind know where this is going.

909
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
You're gonna throw away their clothes.

910
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,240
You can throw away their clothes in the garbage.

911
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,640
I don't wanna just pull their laundry out

912
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,440
and put mine in, that seems rude.

913
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,240
And the laundry will get wrinkly.

914
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,960
So I fold the clothes and put them on top of the dryer.

915
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,680
I know that's weird, but is it too weird?

916
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,080
No one has caught me yet.

917
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,880
Well, that's not a good followup for the question,

918
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,240
is it too weird?

919
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,480
I have no idea what I would say if someone caught me.

920
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,760
I just don't want their clothes to get wrinkly,

921
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,080
but I also need to use the dryer and I don't wanna wait.

922
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,560
Do I need to stop doing this?

923
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,160
That's from Secretly Folding Laundry in San Antonio.

924
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
I don't know.

925
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,720
I'm fucking stumped, man.

926
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,560
I got nothing.

927
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,680
I don't know what weird is anymore.

928
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,920
I've lost all kind of like perspective.

929
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
Yeah.

930
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,240
Oh, you know who could help?

931
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
Let me call Chris Gethard real quick.

932
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,320
Cause he actually...

933
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,720
He's not gonna take your call.

934
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
Well, let me see, hold on.

935
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,840
He's so busy.

936
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm dialing.

937
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,840
Beep, boop, beep, boop, beep, beep.

938
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,080
Beep, boop, boop, beep, beep, boop, beep, boop.

939
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,480
Beep, beep, boop, boop, beep, beep, boop.

940
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Wow.

941
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,440
Sometimes it feels like you just dial with your heart.

942
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,880
That was just me making noises with my mouth.

943
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,080
Okay, now I actually call him.

944
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,800
Now I got him on speed dial.

945
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,120
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

946
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
That's not what speed dial means.

947
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,840
It also is way too many numbers.

948
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,680
Where is he?

949
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,520
I can't hear him.

950
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,360
Who is this?

951
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,200
I'm really fucking busy.

952
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,040
Who is this?

953
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
I told you.

954
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Hi, Chris.

955
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,400
Chris Gethard, welcome to our phone call

956
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,240
that we're having together, a real phone call.

957
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,160
Thank you for calling, but do you know how much

958
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
it cost me to get the custom number

959
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,960
when you wish upon a star?

960
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,960
That was supposed to be Boba Blacksheet.

961
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,080
Boy, is my face red.

962
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,600
I think we may have just doxxed you, Chris Gethard,

963
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,200
for our more musically inclined listeners.

964
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,120
Yeah, it's like a vanity plate, but phone number.

965
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,200
Right.

966
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,120
Once I was on TV for the first time,

967
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,400
I demanded the phone company give me

968
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,320
when you wish upon a star as my phone number.

969
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,360
Yeah, yeah, they did it

970
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,920
because you're one of the Hollywood elite, that's right.

971
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,760
Big time.

972
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
I'm known for it.

973
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah.

974
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,880
It's synonymous at this point.

975
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,760
When someone's like, you know, like a famous person,

976
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,680
like a Chris Gethard, yeah.

977
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,640
Yes, yes.

978
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,040
And then someone says, who?

979
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,320
And they go, he was on the office after Steve Carell left.

980
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,400
He played Dr. Gary LaMarche on NBC's Blindspot.

981
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,600
Show some respect.

982
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Blindspot isn't Blacklist.

983
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,440
No.

984
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,280
Thank you, Justin.

985
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,720
That's really, that's a helpful mnemonic device I use

986
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,400
to keep Blindspot and Blacklist separate in my mind.

987
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,240
Yeah.

988
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,500
My mother-in-law, for every Sunday

989
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,620
when we'd come over for dinner,

990
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,960
for literally 18 months in a row,

991
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,640
would say, have you guys started watching the Blacklist yet?

992
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
I'm thinking about it, man.

993
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,620
It's worth it just for James Spader.

994
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,960
Every time the pitch is the same.

995
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,800
Yeah.

996
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,400
Hey, Chris, we had a laundromat question come up.

997
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,240
You had no way of hearing it,

998
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,400
so I just wanted to sort of recap for you.

999
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,240
Basically, someone wants to use the dryer

1000
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,920
at the laundromat, but there's clothes in it,

1001
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,840
and they take them out and fold them,

1002
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,520
and they want to know if that's okay.

1003
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,280
And I just want to get like your take on it,

1004
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,320
sort of a, you know.

1005
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,120
You're a real clothes horse, and we know that.

1006
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,040
Like, you're big into fashion,

1007
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,240
and you wear Supreme stuff all the time,

1008
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,400
and so we just figured you'd know

1009
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,120
your way around a laundromat.

1010
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
Well, I actually have pretty strong opinions on this.

1011
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,960
Okay, cool.

1012
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,280
Because I lived in Queens, New York, for many years

1013
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,520
in a building that had shared laundry

1014
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,600
and way too few machines for way too many residents.

1015
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,440
Mm, yeah.

1016
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,000
And you are absolutely allowed.

1017
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,520
Well, there's like a certain set of social graces

1018
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,360
you have to go through.

1019
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,340
There's steps you have to take.

1020
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,920
You have to go in, you have to realize

1021
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,000
that the dryer's sitting there full of laundry.

1022
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,360
You have to get kind of huffy about it.

1023
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,760
You have to look around.

1024
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,960
You have to open the door of the dryer.

1025
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Then you have to look around again

1026
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,000
to see if anybody's coming.

1027
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
Shut the door.

1028
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
Then you have to quietly simmer

1029
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,880
that someone has put you in this position.

1030
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1031
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,080
Opening the door and shutting the door.

1032
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,980
Is that like a trap, a distraction?

1033
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,820
What's the purpose of that?

1034
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,960
Is it performative?

1035
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,320
Is it to draw attention?

1036
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,040
You open it because you realize

1037
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,680
you're being put in the bad position

1038
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,960
of having to touch someone else's clothes.

1039
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,800
Oh, okay.

1040
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,640
So you check it out.

1041
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,920
You're gonna give them 10 more seconds

1042
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,040
to get down here and handle this.

1043
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,240
And then you open it again.

1044
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,960
But you give it that cursory open,

1045
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,100
like I cannot believe another human being

1046
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,520
did not set a timer or pay attention

1047
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
to their timer on their phone or whatever.

1048
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,800
They are putting you in a bad position.

1049
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,600
And at that point, if they haven't arrived,

1050
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,800
you are allowed to toss all of their clothes

1051
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
into one of those rolly racks

1052
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,240
and leave their clothes there.

1053
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,640
And I've been on both ends of this.

1054
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,760
I've tossed my fair share of clothes into rolly racks.

1055
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,240
And I'm not proud to say on one or two occasions,

1056
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,800
I've come down to a laundry room

1057
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,080
and found my clothes in a dryer and I deserved it.

1058
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,920
I deserved that.

1059
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,280
And I know that I put that person

1060
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,320
through some mental duress,

1061
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,560
but never fold another person's clothes.

1062
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,400
There you go.

1063
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,220
Thank you.

1064
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,060
That's serial.

1065
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,440
I would rather walk up to someone

1066
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,640
at a nice steak restaurant and then reach down

1067
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,760
and pick up the steak off their plate

1068
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,400
and then set it back down,

1069
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,160
then interface with their clothes on such a deep

1070
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,880
and intimate level required to fucking Marie Kondo

1071
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,320
that shit on such a large scale.

1072
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,800
That makes me want to be sick.

1073
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,780
And listen, you could say, listen,

1074
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,400
one could make the argument that at that moment,

1075
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,120
it's the cleanest the clothes could be.

1076
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,760
And then you're sullying them with you.

1077
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,680
If I came in, and also I like my shirts

1078
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,840
folded a particular way.

1079
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah, they're going to fold it wrong.

1080
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
That's what I was going to say.

1081
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,120
They're going to fold it wrong.

1082
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,880
Not the way, the special way you like to do it.

1083
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,400
And also you're going to find out I left

1084
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,840
like a paper towel in my pocket

1085
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,080
and now there's scraps everywhere.

1086
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,480
And you're going to know that I lazily threw my jeans

1087
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,320
in there or whatever.

1088
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,140
I get it.

1089
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,420
You're going to come across like a sweater

1090
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,540
that should have been laid flat to dry

1091
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,920
that I clearly didn't give two shits about.

1092
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,760
And you're going to judge me.

1093
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,560
That's my secret shame.

1094
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,360
You're not supposed to know about that.

1095
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,280
If I came upon a pile of my own clothes

1096
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,200
that had been folded by a nameless, faceless stranger,

1097
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,060
I would have to throw those clothes away

1098
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,320
and I'd have to move out of that building

1099
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,960
if it was one of my special buildings.

1100
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,240
Because someone would have that on me forever.

1101
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,080
Yeah.

1102
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,900
Right.

1103
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,540
It's just such an invasion.

1104
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,080
I mean, for starters,

1105
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,960
what if your silky drawers are in there?

1106
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,800
You know?

1107
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,640
Exactly.

1108
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,880
What if your silky, sexy drawers are in there?

1109
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,800
Or worse, your lazy day drawers.

1110
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,240
Your lazy day drawers.

1111
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,020
Like you don't want someone pawing all over

1112
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,080
your unmentionables.

1113
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,360
That's a huge problem.

1114
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,300
And then, you know, also,

1115
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,460
what if they do something weird,

1116
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,080
like fold your underwear?

1117
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Like you don't,

1118
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,780
like I would never fold my underwear

1119
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,880
in any scenario in my life ever.

1120
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,720
Do you roll it?

1121
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,000
No, you wad it up and jam it in.

1122
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,140
There's no, I'm a finite person with a finite life.

1123
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,520
Like I'm not going to fold my underwear.

1124
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,760
No one will ever see it.

1125
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,880
Like you jam it in.

1126
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,700
Yeah.

1127
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,540
Now, Chris-

1128
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,380
Anything else is a waste.

1129
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,880
Do you roll it in or do you wad it up and jam it in?

1130
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,500
You wad it up and jam it in.

1131
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,160
You can say, just jam it in.

1132
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,120
Take yourself a step.

1133
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Now, Chris, when you lived in New York

1134
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,020
and you had this issue,

1135
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,480
did you never just like go out to your window

1136
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,240
and put all the clothes on the clothesline

1137
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,320
that ran between your building

1138
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,560
and the building across from you?

1139
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,920
Watch the kids play a stick ball on the street below.

1140
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,020
And you hear kitty cats having fights in trash cans

1141
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,720
and somebody yelling about a pizza or something.

1142
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,040
While the gangs of New York did battle down on the street.

1143
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,880
Yeah.

1144
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,700
The ice man.

1145
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,840
The guy selling, who'd shaved down some ice

1146
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,920
off the big block of ice was clanging his old bell.

1147
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,760
Oh yeah.

1148
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,960
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1149
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,880
As they collected dead from the plague, you know.

1150
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,720
I'm doing it.

1151
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,960
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1152
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,240
Every once in a while I'd do that, sure.

1153
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,280
Yeah, okay.

1154
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,400
Because it seems like I would take advantage of that.

1155
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,280
If I get like, I don't want downy fresh clothes,

1156
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,040
I want the smell of the city on me.

1157
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,680
Like at all times.

1158
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,520
Mm-hmm.

1159
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,400
And then some detective sidekick,

1160
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
a little put-upon boy in a newsboy cap,

1161
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,080
he'd yell up at me,

1162
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,560
hey mister, don't hang those clothes there.

1163
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,880
This is a active investigation, mister.

1164
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,720
Right.

1165
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,900
And you'd say like, I saw something, but I ain't talking.

1166
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,740
Yeah.

1167
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,840
And then they would come put the screws to you, I imagine.

1168
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,680
And also it's good,

1169
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,240
because when you put your clothes on on that clothesline,

1170
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,520
if someone falls out of a building,

1171
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,680
they can land in your unmentionables,

1172
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,120
and that's gonna help break the fall and be comical.

1173
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,280
I have another problem.

1174
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,960
On top of the dryer is the dirtiest place in my house.

1175
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,520
It's covered in lint.

1176
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,440
That's disgusting.

1177
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,120
Now you just in-linted their garments.

1178
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,960
That's horrific.

1179
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,040
That's the punishment though.

1180
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,640
I would say to Chris's point from earlier,

1181
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,520
if they wanted to avoid the in-lintening,

1182
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,640
then they should have been down there

1183
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,680
before the timer ran out, not after.

1184
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,080
Like if it's gonna take like 48 minutes or whatever,

1185
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,160
you set your timer for 43 minutes

1186
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,620
to give yourself time to get down there

1187
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,720
and be poised and ready to remove your clothes as,

1188
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,280
like your hands should be on the handle when the buzzer goes.

1189
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,560
Chris, I have a judgment call for you,

1190
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,640
because you have more experience in this.

1191
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,760
Less weird, folding someone else's clothes

1192
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,560
or taking their clothes and putting them back in the washer.

1193
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,200
And when they come down, just like, you must begin again.

1194
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,480
Like it needed more.

1195
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,000
The cycle starts anew.

1196
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,480
Putting them back in the washer is such a fuck you.

1197
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,600
I looked at them, they were still dirty.

1198
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,340
Had to go one more again.

1199
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,440
What if you pulled them out

1200
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,200
and then you piece by piece hid them separately

1201
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,200
around the room and left a note like,

1202
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,960
yes, your clothes are clean and dry,

1203
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,520
but it's up to you to find them.

1204
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,920
You have all the clues.

1205
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,960
That would drive a person truly insane.

1206
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,640
If a person came down to the laundry room

1207
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,440
in their building and was like, I am positive

1208
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,320
I switched these from the washer to the dryer.

1209
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,920
Why are they back in the washer?

1210
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,920
That's like an Edgar Allen Poe level psychological torture.

1211
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
We need a third device.

1212
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,440
We need a third appliance in the clothes cleaning process

1213
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,840
where you wash and then you dry.

1214
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,960
And then we need like a proving drawer

1215
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,320
where extra clothes can be stored

1216
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,640
so that someone else can get down on the washer.

1217
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,600
Well, if we're trying to avoid, maybe you just put it in

1218
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,000
and it just bounces them around for a while, right?

1219
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,200
It's not really doing anything

1220
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,800
except they can't settle into wrinkles, right?

1221
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
It's just keeping them vibrating.

1222
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,000
That's good, a vibrator.

1223
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,400
We could just call it a vibrator.

1224
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Just call it a vibrator.

1225
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,720
I feel like wrinkles is a burden.

1226
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,200
If you let it go longer than the dryer

1227
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,360
and you are not there to get your own dryer stuff out,

1228
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,400
promptly, I mean, ideally before the buzzer goes off,

1229
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
certainly within three to five minutes after it goes off,

1230
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,240
if it goes past that window,

1231
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
wrinkles are your burden to bear.

1232
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,920
That's your penance to pay.

1233
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,960
And you know that.

1234
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,880
And that's part of the social contract of living in a city

1235
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,600
where you shared laundry rooms.

1236
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,560
If I was on an elevator in a building,

1237
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,800
unsure if one of the other people in there

1238
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,200
had at some point folded my clothes for me,

1239
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,120
I would have to be dead.

1240
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,480
I would have to find a way to turn off my heart and my brain

1241
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,560
because I would never be able to look anyone

1242
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,760
in the eye again.

1243
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,840
Wrinkly clothes are an accepted,

1244
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,080
everyone knows that when you live in a society,

1245
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,040
there's certain actions that have consequences

1246
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,720
and not getting to the dryer promptly

1247
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,480
means you might have wrinkly clothes.

1248
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,520
I'd much prefer wrinkly clothes on my own terms

1249
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,680
than folded clothes on someone else's.

1250
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,440
And I'll die on that hill.

1251
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,400
Also that way, when you're walking around the building

1252
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,520
wearing wrinkly clothes,

1253
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,160
or if you spot someone else doing it and you're like,

1254
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,240
that's them.

1255
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,200
I know that's the person who leaves the laundry in there.

1256
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,720
Now, Chris, let me ask you this,

1257
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,440
cause I'm dying to know.

1258
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,680
Would it be better or worse

1259
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,240
if the question asker had printed up some business cards

1260
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,840
with their face with a picture of them

1261
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,200
and their name on it and like their apartment number

1262
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,160
that said like, listen,

1263
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,240
I don't want you to worry about this.

1264
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,080
I did it.

1265
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,480
I folded your clothes.

1266
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,080
And this is my schedule should you choose to avoid me

1267
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,920
for the rest of our lives.

1268
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Or like, or it says on there like,

1269
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,360
hey, I'm trying to get into business for myself.

1270
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,800
Only the first one's free though.

1271
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,040
So if you would like this kind of attention to detail

1272
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,400
in our white glove service in folding laundry.

1273
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,280
If you came down and they were tied up

1274
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,080
in some like parchment paper

1275
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,920
with like a twine.

1276
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,160
Oh, that's so nice, fuck.

1277
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,840
Like on a cruise ship when you get them

1278
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,360
and they all got the little tags in their basket.

1279
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,560
I feel like that's going to turn this from like weird

1280
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,400
to ooh la la.

1281
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,000
I've got like a fairy godmother.

1282
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,840
Yeah.

1283
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,760
Chris, what else do you got going on?

1284
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,720
What's going on with you, bud?

1285
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,360
You want to just stick around and rap for a while?

1286
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,480
Just what's going on, bud?

1287
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,320
Yeah, what's going on?

1288
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,040
What's going on with me?

1289
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,120
I'm a dad now.

1290
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,640
I got a beard now.

1291
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,480
Everything's changed.

1292
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,920
Whoa.

1293
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,160
Did they happen simultaneously?

1294
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,600
I mean, they all tie into a midlife crisis.

1295
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,920
That's very clear.

1296
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,120
The child triggered a larger midlife crisis

1297
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,640
that has now reflected itself in facial hair.

1298
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,480
Yeah.

1299
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,240
That's why you called your baby Corvette.

1300
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,920
I get it now.

1301
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,760
I didn't understand.

1302
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,920
I actually got a Vespa with the first baby

1303
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,480
and then I was like, that was fucked up.

1304
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,760
And then with the second baby,

1305
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,600
I like reflexively got another Vespa.

1306
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,400
Yeah, that was weird.

1307
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,240
Now I'll tell you, Chris, when my first was born,

1308
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,880
I had a very long beard

1309
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,400
right up until she was about nine months old

1310
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,920
at which point she was able to make full blown fists

1311
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,480
and attempt to remove my beard from my face

1312
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,680
at which point I shorn it down to quite a short level.

1313
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,440
So just, I am not quite certain how old your baby is

1314
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,960
but you've got that to look forward to.

1315
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,680
He's about to be three.

1316
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,520
And I cannot grow enough facial hair to have him,

1317
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,240
he already punches me, kicks me, gales in my face.

1318
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,000
He's at that age already where,

1319
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,480
I'll tell you the exact window he's in

1320
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,600
because I've heard that most kids go through this is,

1321
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,080
he can pee in the potty, no problem,

1322
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,280
but he gets really embarrassed about pooping.

1323
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,560
So he poops in the diaper

1324
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,920
and then when you go to change the diaper,

1325
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,360
he's humiliated and shamed

1326
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,640
and reacts with rage and violence.

1327
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,600
That's the exact window.

1328
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,080
That's how I feel when I poop too, just like still.

1329
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,280
It's gross, it sucks that we have to do that.

1330
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
It's so weird and our parents told me

1331
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,780
I was the only one who did it.

1332
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,760
That's fucked up that they said that to you, Trapp.

1333
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,080
Yeah, I know, it's really weird.

1334
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,080
Hey, you got a new essay coming out from Scribd Originals.

1335
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,620
Oh yeah, I'm promoting.

1336
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,880
I wrote a thing called Dad on Pills.

1337
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,840
It's on a service called Scribd.

1338
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,880
It's not quite book length, but it's up there.

1339
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,260
You can get an audio book or ebook.

1340
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,280
And it's all about, I think a lot of people

1341
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,440
of our generation, it's like we're the first people

1342
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,160
who started openly saying like,

1343
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,760
hey, I take Depakote, I take Xanax, I have anxiety,

1344
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,540
I have depression, we're all gonna talk about these things.

1345
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,640
But I wrote a thing that's all been all about

1346
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,840
how I'm reconciling that with being a dad.

1347
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,840
Because a dad, like you're supposed to be a role model.

1348
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,840
Mole rattle?

1349
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,680
Mole rattle.

1350
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,500
A mole rattle.

1351
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,340
You're supposed to be a mole.

1352
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,200
You're supposed to be a Moe Rocca.

1353
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,420
My father was a fantastic orator

1354
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,920
and a fine mole rattle for me growing up.

1355
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,000
I've spent my whole adult life feeling sort of like broken

1356
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,640
and not like a god, I don't feel like a man

1357
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,680
by the traditional standards.

1358
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,300
And now I have a son, that's ridiculous.

1359
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,840
So it's all about that.

1360
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,960
And it's pretty funny and I like it.

1361
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
And it's raw and it's real.

1362
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,060
Can I ask you a question, Chris,

1363
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,240
that I was struggling with last night?

1364
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,080
Sure.

1365
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,960
And this is a little more serious,

1366
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,200
but we have raised a lot of guesses.

1367
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,760
It's not heavy, it's just like one more thoughtful.

1368
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,880
My kids are like talking but not communicating.

1369
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,520
Just like, you know how kids are just sometimes like,

1370
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,200
I just gotta make some noise.

1371
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,040
Oh yeah.

1372
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,280
And they were both doing it

1373
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,440
and I was really getting stressed out

1374
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,960
because I get too much like noise, people talking,

1375
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,400
and then you're feeding the kids

1376
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,500
and it gets like just because of the way

1377
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,280
my brain's all put together,

1378
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,480
I got like unduly frustrated

1379
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,960
and like really in my head about it.

1380
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,760
And I really struggled with should I like,

1381
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,240
should I tell my kids that like,

1382
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,460
it's hard for me when this has happened?

1383
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,000
Like, it was a real struggle.

1384
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,600
Like I didn't know really how to handle it.

1385
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,220
Like I felt weird telling them

1386
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,120
that they had to modify my behavior

1387
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,720
because of my, you know, mental illness.

1388
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,940
And like, I feel like as a parent,

1389
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,160
sometimes I have this urge

1390
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
that I should just like keep trucking

1391
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,000
and keep on pushing through no matter what,

1392
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,800
but it did feel like admitting a frailty to them.

1393
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,720
And I don't know, I just wanted to get your thoughts

1394
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,280
on that sort of broader idea.

1395
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,160
This thing that I wrote,

1396
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,520
it's exactly about all those questions like that.

1397
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,000
And I'm with you.

1398
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,840
Oh, so you're saying I gotta get the black guy.

1399
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,680
You gotta pay for it.

1400
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,120
He's gotta get his nut milk away.

1401
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,360
I gotta get his nut.

1402
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,000
Plug, plug, plug.

1403
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,560
No, but I'm with you and it's exactly,

1404
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,800
just I sit there and I have all those instincts too

1405
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,080
of like, I better put the poker face on

1406
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,760
and I better make them think everything's okay

1407
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,720
and I gotta be strong for my son.

1408
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,480
And my dad did all those things for me

1409
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,840
and he's a great dad.

1410
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,820
But then I also think about how many years

1411
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,820
I've unwrapped so much of those exact things in therapy

1412
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,500
and how that mentality of feeling like you need to be tough

1413
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,880
in the face of stuff and how you shouldn't show emotion,

1414
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,480
like how much that built to boiling points for me.

1415
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,860
And I go, oh, this is all stuff that instinctively

1416
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,920
I'm feeling like I have to do

1417
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,680
because that's the only example I know.

1418
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,840
Maybe some of it's example, some of it's biological.

1419
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,920
I don't know, but it didn't work out well for me.

1420
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,440
All those traditional, like, I wish that maybe at,

1421
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,800
I'm not the only person of my age

1422
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,320
who probably wishes my dad could have been

1423
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,920
a little more emotional,

1424
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,820
who could have let his guard down at times

1425
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,020
and maybe that would have let me let my guard down.

1426
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,520
And I sit here and I'm like, man, I am a mess.

1427
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,720
I'm an actual mess.

1428
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,120
I had an incident, we moved to our house in Jersey

1429
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,620
and I write about this in the thing that I'm plugging,

1430
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,620
but I started to have like an attack.

1431
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,120
Like I've had these panic attacks,

1432
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,640
these anxiety attacks over the years.

1433
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,000
And I realized I hadn't looked up the mental hospital

1434
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,160
closest to me at my new house.

1435
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,960
So I looked it up just in case I had to go.

1436
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,560
And it was one that we used to,

1437
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,840
when we were growing up in Jersey,

1438
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,720
one big thing that people like to do for fun

1439
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,840
is they go and they break into abandoned mental hospitals.

1440
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,560
Yeah, it's really fun.

1441
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,040
And I was like, oh, it's Greystone Hospital.

1442
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,200
I've broken into the abandoned parts of that.

1443
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,160
Am I really gonna go be,

1444
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,960
is that the full circle moment of my life?

1445
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,400
Like when I was 16,

1446
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,840
I used to break into this mental hospital for fun

1447
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,520
and now I'm gonna go be a patient there.

1448
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,280
And I'm in my yard holding my son.

1449
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,480
It's the circle of life.

1450
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,940
That's the real circle of life.

1451
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,720
And I'm like Googling that with my phone in one hand

1452
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,760
while holding my son in the other and crying.

1453
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,360
And I'm just like, oh, I am bad at being a dad

1454
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,160
in the traditional sense.

1455
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,380
So how do I do this?

1456
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,160
And when I went to look for advice on it,

1457
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,080
there wasn't much out there.

1458
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,360
So I just wrote a thing that is funny.

1459
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,760
I'm not qualified to give advice,

1460
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,360
but it's like a funny look at stuff like this.

1461
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,200
It's never stopped us.

1462
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,360
Yeah, we've been doing it for 13 years.

1463
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,200
There you go.

1464
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,840
Yeah, you build up, right?

1465
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,320
You just start getting honest.

1466
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,760
You just gotta start getting honest.

1467
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,000
You can also, Justin, you can just do what I do,

1468
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,760
which is I'm very open about my emotions

1469
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,040
and my mental health and my kids,

1470
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,560
but then I also tell them stories

1471
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,800
about different wild animals

1472
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,360
that I've been in fist fight with

1473
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,520
and how much I've embarrassed those animals

1474
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,200
and be like, yeah, there's one time three bears came in

1475
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,480
and I whooped their asses.

1476
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,380
I do that too.

1477
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,880
I'm like, yeah, I know I'm crying

1478
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,400
about this McDonald's commercial I saw

1479
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,760
and I don't seem to be very okay,

1480
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,800
but I built that table you're eating on, kid.

1481
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,720
Yeah, right, right, right.

1482
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,320
Oh yeah, I just watched 30 seconds of Homeward Bound

1483
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,800
and yeah, now I'm sobbing,

1484
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,920
but also watch me pick up this heavy chair.

1485
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,080
I can't listen to Sola Salute from Seussical,

1486
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,280
so what, kid?

1487
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,120
Get off my case.

1488
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,440
Well, I got a punch to the drywall.

1489
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,760
I got 50 cigars.

1490
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,120
Hey, you're going on the road again.

1491
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,960
Yeah.

1492
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,040
That's gotta feel, gotta be exciting.

1493
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,880
Oh, it's the best.

1494
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,720
I had started going on the road last year

1495
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,080
and then the Omicron shut it down.

1496
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,920
Oh yeah.

1497
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,760
Pushed it back five months.

1498
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,580
Oh yeah, baby.

1499
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,420
Yeah, baby.

1500
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,560
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1501
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,200
I got it all scheduled starting in May.

1502
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,780
People can go to ChrisGeth.com

1503
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,840
and I got, I mean, dates all over the country

1504
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,840
of Florida and California and Portland and Seattle

1505
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,480
and guess where else?

1506
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,880
West Virginia.

1507
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,720
That's right.

1508
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,540
For the first time.

1509
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,380
Come to Morgantown.

1510
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,200
For the first time.

1511
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,040
Have you never been to West Virginia

1512
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,880
or have you never performed?

1513
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,560
I've driven through West Virginia

1514
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,620
and in my past life, I used to work at a book series

1515
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,780
all about haunted places and conspiracy theories and stuff,

1516
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,160
so I've driven around West Virginia

1517
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,000
in relation to that.

1518
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,280
I went to the Trans-Allegheny Asylum there.

1519
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,480
There's a huge abandoned mental hospital

1520
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,800
that they turned into a haunted house.

1521
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,640
Tasteful.

1522
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,480
Love that.

1523
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,920
Love it.

1524
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,760
Yes.

1525
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,880
Yeah, we did, when we had all our tours planned out

1526
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,160
for 2020 and I can remember very clearly

1527
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,220
having this discussion of like,

1528
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,060
well, we had to cancel the March shows,

1529
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,720
but I bet this will be all set by April.

1530
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,880
And I was right,

1531
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,240
it turned out to be April 2022.

1532
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,080
Yeah.

1533
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,920
Oh, so you guys got your tour dates back up?

1534
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,760
Oh, yeah.

1535
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,580
Yeah.

1536
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,420
Good, good.

1537
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,480
I wanted to name the tour something

1538
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,640
like the God Willing and the Creep Don't Rise tour

1539
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,880
or the Tempest.

1540
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,880
This time for sure.

1541
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,180
Yeah, the Pending to, the Hubris of Man tour.

1542
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,420
That's at KrisGeth.com.

1543
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,660
Scribd is where you can find

1544
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,360
Kris' new, not a book, I know.

1545
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,800
It's like a novella, but it's a novella.

1546
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,400
It's called Dad on Pills.

1547
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,220
You'll like it.

1548
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,060
Dad on Pills.

1549
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,760
And well, Kris, I appreciate you being here, bud.

1550
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,600
Thank you.

1551
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,420
Oh, thanks for having me.

1552
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,240
And we didn't even talk any smack about J.D. Amato,

1553
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,080
which we could have done.

1554
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,920
Oh, we will.

1555
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,240
Oh, that fucking clown.

1556
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,720
Join us for the NBNB AM after show.

1557
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,660
Yeah.

1558
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,940
Uh-huh.

1559
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,640
Thank you, that was so fun.

1560
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,960
Thank you so much.

1561
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,800
Thank you.

1562
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,600
That was, no, that was for Kris Gethard.

1563
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,720
That wasn't for you.

1564
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,540
Damn it.

1565
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,380
How dare you?

1566
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,400
Don't try to steal one of Justin's precious thankses.

1567
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,460
Well, I was just so excited.

1568
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,360
You know, like on Great British Bake Off,

1569
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,640
when Paul Hollywood goes in for the handshake

1570
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,360
and another contestant will swoop in

1571
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,280
and take the handshake and then Paul's like,

1572
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,120
damn it.

1573
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,480
Yeah, I touched you.

1574
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,160
Sorry, I was gonna shake your hand,

1575
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,440
but then Tom Rick came over and took it.

1576
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,480
Tom Rick is the name of every contestant on the show.

1577
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,240
Anyway, thank you, Kris Gethard,

1578
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,600
and thank you to you for listening.

1579
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,640
And I guess thank you to Travis.

1580
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,480
Yes.

1581
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,300
Yes.

1582
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,140
I don't need your thanks.

1583
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:47,980
Yes.

1584
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,800
I don't need it.

1585
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,640
Fucking got it.

1586
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,800
Travis, do the promotions.

1587
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,640
You're good at that.

1588
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,480
Oh, right, right, right.

1589
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,600
So we're really excited.

1590
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,360
We're going back on the road.

01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,440
You don't have to say the states.

01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,200
Oh, Mashantucket.

1599
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,680

01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,160
People aren't going to be like,

1602
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,280
oh, you mean San Diego, North Carolina?

1603
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,120
You know?

1604
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:23,940
Well, I know, but I was trying to get,

1605
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,160
I was trying to pump it up, you know,

1606
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,280
because sometimes people just like hearing

1607
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,820
the name of their state, you know what I mean?

1608
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,660
Yeah.

1609
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,640
That's how I feel when I hear Ohio.

1610
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,760

We're trying to catch up here.

for the virtual show on Saturday.

1628
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,040
That hasn't happened yet.

1629
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,160
No, but it will once people listen to this.

1630
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,000
We haven't done it yet.

1631
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,040
How do you know if anybody joined?

1632
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,880
Maybe nobody joined.

1633
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,140
Well, at least dad will be there.

1634
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,920

1635
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,920
You can still watch that now at bit.ly slash NBNB AM virtual.

1636
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,760
Maybe you'll be the first.

1637
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,580
Maybe you'll be the first to see it.

1638
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,420
Well, I doubt they'll be.

1639
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,520
NBNB AM virtual.

1640
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,360

I know, bit.ly slash NBNB AM virtual.

1642
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,880
There's no way they'll be the first.

1643
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,520

and benefits the Huntington Children's Museum.

1663
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,040
Also, I'm on Twitch.

1665
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,960
Hey, thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

1666
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,120
My Life Is Better With You.

1667
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,160
If you're in the mood for dope tracks,

1668
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,880
she just did a new single with David Byrne

1669
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,280
called Always Be You.

1670
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,120
Possible.

1671
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,940
Impossible.

1672
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,780
Nobody's that cool.

1673
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,760
It's possible she is that cool.

1674
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,160
And yeah, thank you.

1675
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,740
Thank you, Montaigne.

1676
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,760
And that's it.

1677
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,680
We don't have a final Yahoo ever again,

1678
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,920
but instead let's just-

1679
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,760
Will you do-

1680
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,580
Short prayer?

1681
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,560
The thing is you're doing a new bit.

1682
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,400
Yeah, maybe.

1683
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,280
Oh, Griffin, maybe this is your final point

1684
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,520
sign off to a college graduation.

1685
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,020
This is your don't forget to wear sunscreen

1686
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,860
or something like that.

1687
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,720
You do know that I am doing that in a couple of places.

1688
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,960
Oh, then this is great practice.

1689
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,800
We haven't talked.

1690
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,300
Listen, Griffin, we don't have time

1691
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:08,400
to get into that because it will be a thorough conversation

1692
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,240
when we do address that topic.

1693
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,780
Well, then I will say that go out there

1694
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:20,120
and just fucking go ahead and just go out.

1695
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,360
Sorry, it's go out there.

1696
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,200
Go ahead.

1697
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,240
Tonight-

1698
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,240
That sounds like you're holding the door open

1699
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,400
for the graduating class.

1700
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,860
Tonight, make the most of it.

1701
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,840
And go out there.

1702
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,660
Go out there.

1703
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,500
Go ahead.

1704
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,680
Good shit, Applebee's.

1705
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,800
Why didn't Justin-

1706
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

1707
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1708
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,760
This has been my brother,

1709
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,840
my brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1710
01:06:44,840 --> 01:07:07,840
It's better with you.

1711
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:14,840
My life is better with you.
