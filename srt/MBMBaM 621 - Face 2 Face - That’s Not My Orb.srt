1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,160
And their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,560
Travis insists he's a sexpert.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,000
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,040
so the babies out there will know

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,540
how cool they are for listening.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,760
What's up, you cool baby?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,280
One, two, three, four.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,280
It's the start of something beautiful.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,760
It's ripened into a precious friendship.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,160
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,000
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My life, it feels like life.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
Ah, it's better, it's better with you.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,920
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,920
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,280
My life, ah, it's better with you.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,520
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,440
and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:52,520
And I'm secret agent Damien Ice.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm secret agent Damien Ice Blade.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
It's Griffin's first time wearing a tuxedo.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Who, who the fuck is Griffin?

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm Damien Ice Blade, secret agent,

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
government agent for the spy one.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Oh, wait, Ice Blade of the Nantucket Ice Blades?

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Yes.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I heard you were fired in disgrace

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
for playing by your own rules.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,520
But they needed me when the terrorists did a,

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,520
did the, did a disease bomb.

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Good luck picking something that isn't happening

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,520
in the real world now.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
It's a, it's a small.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
It's a narrow window.

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Small sliver.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
And who knows when this will air.

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Yeah, right.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
By the time this episode goes out, no matter what you say.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
They knew about the Jell-O disaster.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
How could they joke about it?

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Bring them in.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Bring them in.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
They knew too much already.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,520
I hate this.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
You hate what?

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
You hate being fancy and dressed up?

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I miss my tuxedo t-shirt for so many reasons.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,520
The first of which being that it breathes

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,520
quite a bit better than my current attire.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Okay.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Okay, but hey.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,520
You're the one who after Fox was like,

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm sick of being the not.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
So sloppy, the sloppy one.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Yeah, I want to be the not sloppy boy.

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Everyone knows me as the sloppy one.

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
No, no, no.

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Yeah, no.

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
It seemed like a great idea at the time.

65
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Okay.

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Hey, do you all want to hear, as long as you're here,

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
do you want to hear a story?

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Is this about how the elephant got its tail?

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
No.

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Griffin, are you going to leave the sunglasses on?

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Probably.

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Yeah.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Although this is fucked up.

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,520
I can see my own eyeballs because of the lights.

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm going to spend this entire show

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:00,520
delivering all my incredible jokes to myself point blank.

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Now, Griffin, you mean you can see the reflection

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
of your own eyeballs, right?

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,520
I don't even know anymore where, it might be Damien.

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I think he wants out.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,520
My, did you make a deal with Khonshu?

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Because this could be a problem.

83
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
I want to hear Justin's incredible story.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,520
You all know my Grandpa Dan?

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,520
He's Sidney's grandfather on her dad's side.

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Grandpa Dan?

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
He went to Auburn?

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Okay.

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
He's a southern fellow and he kind of talks like this

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
when I do an impression of him.

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
It's more the essence of Grandpa Dan.

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
It was, the story starts off sad.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,520
He had a fall and he's so old that he couldn't get up from it.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Why are you laughing at that?

95
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
That's so mean.

96
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
We're not to the funny part yet.

97
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Still laughing.

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
You monsters.

99
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
So he fell over.

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
He fell and he couldn't get up.

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
What's funny about that?

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
He fell and he couldn't get up or get to the phone

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
or call anybody and eventually we went over and he'd been,

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
and we had to take him to the hospital and we thought.

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Pretty funny, huh?

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah.

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Pretty funny stuff.

108
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Shuckle busters.

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Keep it going.

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Let me get past this part, okay?

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Yeah, no, please, Justin.

112
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,520
No, Justin, they're relishing in it.

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
They're loving this.

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Yeah, their sides are slitting.

115
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
They're going to have to go to the hospital now

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
to have their sides stitched up.

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
He thought he was going to die.

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Yeah.

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Because he's old.

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
All right.

121
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
He's not.

122
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,520
He didn't, which is not the story,

123
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,520
but it is important to know that Grandpa Dan

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
has been a reserved man his whole life

125
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,520
and he's never done a lot of stuff that you've done,

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,520
like, for instance, go to Taco Bell.

127
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,520
So my 88-year-old Grandpa Dan this week went to Taco Bell

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
for the first time in his life.

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Now, is this...

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Are we calling this like a backdoor Munch Squad light?

131
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
No, it's not.

132
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I mean, it is important to remember that brand eating

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
affects all of us in different ways.

134
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Right, sure, yeah.

135
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,520
So Grandpa Dan goes to Taco Bell.

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
That's my favorite children's book, by the way.

137
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Yeah.

138
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Grandpa Dan goes to Taco Bell,

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
and as he related the story, he said...

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Well, I looked at the menu and I just...

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,520
I had no idea what to order.

142
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
It's overwhelming.

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
So I got a taco.

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,520
He got...

145
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,520
It could be worse.

146
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
He could have ordered a bell.

147
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,520
He got a taco with beef and lettuce,

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
and he said he was not impressed.

149
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,520
No.

150
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
You've really tied Taco Bell's hands behind its back.

151
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Not only that, but I love that no one had told Dan

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
up to that point,

153
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
if your expectation is to be impressed...

154
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Well, no, you're not going to be impressed

155
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,520
with a crunchy hard shell taco and beef and lettuce.

156
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
No one would be.

157
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
So Tommy got on his case.

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
That's Sidney's dad.

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
He said, oh, you should have let me take you

160
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
because Tommy's got a whole thing, right?

161
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
He's banging out a customized crunch wrap

162
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
with beans and nacho cheese on there

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
and like a quesadilla and stuff like that.

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,520
And I was telling Sidney, he can't do that.

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
No.

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,520
You can't jump 40 years of Taco Bell evolution.

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
There's got to be a middle ground there.

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
You're handing a caveman a Swiffer wet jet at that point.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,520
He can't contextualize what are floors.

170
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,520
You know, like he can't contextualize a Swiffer wet jet

171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
in much the same way that if you hand that man

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
a naked chicken chalupa.

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
No way.

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
He's down on the ground again.

175
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
He's down on the ground again.

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
But we are going to make a return trip to Taco Bell

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
with Grandpa Dan.

178
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,520
My plan is just to get him one thing from each decade

179
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,520
so we can ease him into the naked chicken chalupa

180
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
quesadilla supreme.

181
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Can you imagine sitting down and doing like the Munch Squad

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
about the giant cheese that to start it to Grandpa Dan?

183
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Oh my God.

184
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Where he's like, wait, did I die and wake up

185
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
in an alternate universe?

186
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Is that what's happening here?

187
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
I mean, I don't know.

188
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
I mean, I just, the lack of cheese on there

189
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
is really fucking with me.

190
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Yeah, right?

191
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Anyway, it is, he didn't want to go that far outside

192
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
of his comfort zone.

193
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Anyway, cheese?

194
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
I don't know.

195
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
I don't know.

196
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,520
So this is an advice show.

197
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
If Grandpa Dan had asked for my advice about Taco Bell,

198
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm sure I would have been very helpful to him,

199
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
but I was not consulted.

200
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Did he not do cinnamon twists?

201
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Because that's like the best thing at Taco Bell.

202
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
We still got that, right?

203
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Yeah, he did not get cinnamon twists.

204
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,520
No, he got a crunchy taco.

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
I am.

206
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
And he went crunchy too.

207
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm busting up over here.

208
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm trying to move on to the advice portion in Travis.

209
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
It's just I never talked to Justin

210
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
and I want to know what's going on.

211
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,520
It is nice to catch up at these live events.

212
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm also waiting for Justin's iPad to link to his phone

213
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
so he can get Wi-Fi.

214
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah, you guys vamp for a second.

215
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I was trying to.

216
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I can read the first question here if you'd like.

217
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
I would love that actually.

218
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,520
He loaded it up backstage where the Wi-Fi is so nice.

219
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Swimming in it.

220
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,520
You can feel it in the air in the green room.

221
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Oh, now I got it.

222
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Will I have...

223
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
This is a brief one.

224
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Will I have time to go to Olive Garden after your show today?

225
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,520
And that's from a something in Salt Lake.

226
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Are you here?

227
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Wait, no, this is a very important one.

228
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Are you here?

229
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Yeah.

230
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I think I heard a yeah.

231
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay.

232
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,520
It's possible that they didn't come because their priorities are...

233
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
They Googled it and they're like,

234
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm not making it to Olive Garden if I go to that show.

235
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Now, okay, so I pulled the questions

236
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,520
and I realized something now that I didn't realize then.

237
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
And I can assume what you meant,

238
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
but I realize now that you just wrote like,

239
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
can you go to Olive Garden after the show?

240
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Yeah.

241
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Yeah.

242
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
You can go to Olive Garden anytime.

243
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Sure.

244
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I don't know that you'll be able to go in and dine there.

245
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
It might be closed,

246
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
but if you just want to see it after the show.

247
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
But let me...

248
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Travis, if you came to my house,

249
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
they close at 10 PM by the way,

250
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
so that would be...

251
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Yeah, you got time.

252
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
We can get you out of here.

253
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah.

254
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
We got a timer going right there.

255
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
We're going to go rain pace everyone and get you out of here.

256
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
It is.

257
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
In time to hit the OG.

258
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
At most, how far I drive?

259
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
3.9 miles away.

260
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay.

261
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
We're going to do three on course though.

262
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
It's an hour and 45 minute walk.

263
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
So if you're walking, you're not...

264
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
You're boned, dude.

265
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
13 minutes drive.

266
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
There's scooters outside though.

267
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Justin did the scooter here.

268
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Oh, yeah, I guess I did.

269
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Thanks, Travis.

270
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Not in the tuxedo because that would have been too much.

271
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Says the guy wearing a tiara.

272
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
When I got out on the app, by the way,

273
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
I don't do this at home.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
We don't have scooters,

275
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
so I was very swept up in the novelty.

276
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
It was hot and I went for it.

277
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
It says on the app,

278
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
make sure you don't ride on sidewalks.

279
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Make sure you stay in the street.

280
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Do you want me to fucking die?

281
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Do you know how many...

282
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Do you know that's where cars is?

283
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Because they are.

284
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
That's what cars is.

285
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm sorry, app.

286
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Cars is big scooters.

287
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Cars...

288
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
You know how there's two little wheels on a little scooter

289
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
and no engine but my leg?

290
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Imagine if you will.

291
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
No one's impressed.

292
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,520
If I leave the sidewalk,

293
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,520
I lose my competitive advantage.

294
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,520
No one's impressed by a tiny shitty car in the street,

295
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,520
but if I zoom someone past...

296
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Thank you, Paul.

297
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Here's what we're looking at.

298
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Here's what we're looking at.

299
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,520
We got a diagram of the drive.

300
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Here's what I cannot imagine happening

301
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,520
in a scooter on a street scenario.

302
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
How long a drive are we talking there?

303
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Fifteen.

304
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Fifteen minutes.

305
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Okay, we could get you there one minute before it closes.

306
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
They ain't kicking you out after that.

307
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
No.

308
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Because if Travis came to my house right before bedtime,

309
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I was like, can I have some spaghetti, please?

310
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Of course I would do it because he is my family.

311
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Now, it might be begrudging and it might be begrudging there as well.

312
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I might say, Griffin, I know it's 9.59,

313
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
but I need some pasta.

314
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm carving up for a big race tomorrow like I do.

315
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
And Griffin would be like, again?

316
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Can I get that?

317
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
I get that?

318
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
And then I would say, you got to try this new shit.

319
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,520
It's like spaghetti but not wet

320
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,520
and it has this crunch to it that'll...

321
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I wouldn't fall for it.

322
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Drive you wild.

323
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm a grown man with a pocket square.

324
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I would like to see a car wave a scooter in.

325
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Like, no, you go in front of me.

326
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Please, please.

327
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm happy to be behind you, a person on a scooter.

328
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Why would they up the ante?

329
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,520
You just gave me a direction in the app about how to go

330
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,520
and now you're like, you're ready for the big show.

331
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
And now with that, at the end it says,

332
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
be sure to always wear a helmet.

333
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Hey, fucko, if I had a helmet, I'd have a scooter.

334
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Yeah.

335
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Like, if I had planned for this, I certainly would have...

336
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Like, I'd have the things I need.

337
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
I don't have the things I need.

338
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Is there something on there that's like,

339
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
and don't go on the highway.

340
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Yes.

341
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,520
And make sure you leave this here and get a car

342
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,520
because you shouldn't be doing this.

343
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
How about another question?

344
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I'd love that.

345
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Just give me one second.

346
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Did you close?

347
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Are you new?

348
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
It's just that my battery's really low,

349
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
so I'm trying to conserve it.

350
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
If only you had had a chance today.

351
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I had to be ready for the 10 PM show right after this one.

352
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I get that, yeah.

353
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm trying to conserve.

354
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
That's where we bring out the good stuff.

355
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
All the jokes are the same, though.

356
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
You're not missing anything.

357
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Don't worry about it.

358
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,520
I oftentimes have a deep thirst for milk.

359
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
And now the question.

360
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
No.

361
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I oftentimes have a deep thirst for milk.

362
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
At home, this usually isn't a problem.

363
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Wait, usually?

364
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
It might be out of milk.

365
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Yeah.

366
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
At home, this usually isn't a problem,

367
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,520
but some bar and restaurant waitstaff are taken aback

368
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,520
and unsure if they can help quench this desire.

369
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
The problem is that on more than one occasion,

370
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
the server will come back triumphant or surprised

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,520
and say that they, quote, found some.

372
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Should I be worried about this unexpected surprise milk?

373
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Would not downing the glass be a dishonor

374
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
upon the hard work they did?

375
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
That's from Leery Lactose in Las Vegas.

376
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Are you here?

377
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
All right.

378
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
All right.

379
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Thanks for making the drive.

380
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,520
That's a strong, just calcium-filled woo.

381
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,520
So calcified that woo was.

382
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I also want to say maybe the reason they're taken aback

383
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,520
is if you say something like, I have a deep passion for milk.

384
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Yeah, that's no good.

385
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I have an unshakable thirst for milk.

386
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
If you can give me some of that beautiful mood juice, please.

387
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,520
This is not an issue if you only eat at Dave and Buster's,

388
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,520
because they got you.

389
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Dave and Buster's, a lot of milk there?

390
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
They got milk.

391
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I had Dave and Buster's milk today.

392
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,520
It's very ethical.

393
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,520
They let Dave and Buster watch Netflix,

394
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,520
and they hook them up to this apparatus.

395
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,520
It's got plenty of vitamin D and B.

396
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Yeah.

397
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,520
They like to watch old boxing documentaries as it withdraws.

398
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
And they've actually scientifically determined

399
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,520
there's more production during the actual fight.

400
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Yeah.

401
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,520
It is gray.

402
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah.

403
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah.

404
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Don't look directly at it.

405
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
And don't drink directly at it.

406
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
No.

407
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
And it costs 200 tickets.

408
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,520
And don't drink Buster's before they mix it with Dave's.

409
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,520
You know what they say, Buster before Dave, catch the wave.

410
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Dave before Buster, you're feeling flustered.

411
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Yeah.

412
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Oh, Dave and Buster's.

413
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't drink that milk.

414
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Don't drink that milk.

415
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
You have to know.

416
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
They worked so hard to bring you that milk.

417
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
So?

418
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
They worked hard.

419
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,520
If you didn't want, you don't put the requirements of that

420
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
on any other food item that they bring.

421
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
If only there was some way, like maybe a monetary way

422
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
that you could reward someone for their hard work at a restaurant

423
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,520
that had nothing to do with you consuming 25-year-old milk.

424
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Everything's all about money.

425
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Yeah.

426
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,520
If this is the sort of person that throws cash around

427
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
to fix problems, I don't think they're quite so hung up

428
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
on what the person thinks of them for ordering milk.

429
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Oh, sorry, Justin.

430
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
You can't be conscientious and rich.

431
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
No.

432
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm just saying.

433
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
I would say pretty empirically no.

434
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
No, yeah.

435
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah, I didn't think I'd be able to ride that one too far.

436
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah.

437
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Could you ask, could you drink some?

438
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Let me show you what drinking looks like.

439
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Could you drink some and say, I got to be honest with you,

440
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
this is the best milk I've ever had,

441
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
and I need you to bring the container

442
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
so I can always buy this milk.

443
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,520
And then you check the date surreptitiously.

444
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Is that our concern?

445
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
The concern is the date, right?

446
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Yeah, you can check the date while you're having a conversation

447
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
when you're like, oh, how interesting, current events.

448
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
JonBenét Ramsey is missing.

449
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Oh, no.

450
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Is this Star Wars, The Phantom Menace?

451
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I love that flick.

452
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:44,520
This milk is a tie-in with Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ride.

453
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Unfathomable.

454
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I mean, I know how it is.

455
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I mean, you got to have your milk.

456
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I think you just got to take your chances.

457
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Worst case scenario.

458
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
No.

459
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Milk is like the worst food to say, take your chances.

460
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Yeah, I need to see it from teat to bucket to,

461
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
I want Louis Pasteur to be like, you're good.

462
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
You're good.

463
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
You're good.

464
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I did this one myself, my man.

465
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
I guess.

466
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I mean, I guess.

467
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
No, it is the one food.

468
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
If you say spoiled blank, the answer is,

469
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
no one's ever like spoiled potato chips.

470
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It's always milk.

471
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Milk is the thing you're most worried about being bad.

472
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
But expiration dates are made up by the government.

473
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Not, but to a point, Justin.

474
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Tell me about it.

475
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Thank you.

476
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
They're not real.

477
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,520
If someone said, I've been saving this yogurt for a special occasion.

478
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
No, don't act like that.

479
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Worst case scenario, you got some celebratory cheese.

480
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
No big deal.

481
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Sure.

482
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
No, worst case scenario, you have some celebratory diarrhea.

483
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Sure.

484
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
That too.

485
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Thank you.

486
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,520
The neighbors we share a wall with seem to be starting a band.

487
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,520
We've never really spoken to them, but we think they sound pretty good

488
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
and want to let them know we enjoy hearing them.

489
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
What is the best way to say this to them

490
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
without sounding creepy or passive aggressive?

491
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,520
That's from nosy noise neighbors in Provo.

492
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Are you here?

493
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
How many of you are there?

494
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Wait.

495
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Hold on.

496
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Wait.

497
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Are you here?

498
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Okay.

499
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Thank you.

500
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
This is a fast one.

501
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
I have a slam dunk answer for you.

502
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Great.

503
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
That's awesome.

504
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Because I didn't want to get a hand on this ball.

505
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Yeah.

506
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
This is about moving through these as quickly as possible.

507
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,520
So we can get our friend Olive Garden.

508
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Change your Wi-Fi network name.

509
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Oh, yes.

510
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
New band next door.

511
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Love it.

512
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
I don't know that they can be that long.

513
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
New band?

514
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Cool.

515
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
New band cool.

516
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
N-U-B-A-N-D.

517
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Cool.

518
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,520
New band cool would be a good name for a band.

519
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Yeah.

520
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
You could also do C.

521
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,520
If you're worried about characters, C-U with an umlaut L.

522
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Yeah.

523
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
That would save you some serious.

524
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,520
That's the same exact number of characters I feel like.

525
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Well, the umlaut's not separate.

526
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Oh, yes.

527
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Fine.

528
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Fine.

529
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
That's cool, but we'll allow it.

530
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
I don't think you can have an umlaut in the...

531
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Because the SSID I think would be...

532
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
You'd have to have an umlaut in there.

533
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Anyway.

534
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Just go over to their phone and write it on the...

535
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Love your stuff, by the way.

536
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Hold on.

537
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Do you...

538
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Are you...

539
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Are you sure you want to be the only fan of this band?

540
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Because they're in Skunk Works territory right now.

541
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
They're just playing to try to figure out if it's anything.

542
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Yeah.

543
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I feel like if you come in that early and you're just like, bada bada bop, I'm loving

544
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
it.

545
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,520
You are setting up a wild, unrealistic expectation for support.

546
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Yeah.

547
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,520
You could be on a date in your apartment and just hear like, hey, what do you think

548
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
about this?

549
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Was that anything?

550
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
You like that?

551
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Did that go too hard?

552
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Well, there's...

553
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I was worried it went too hard.

554
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,520
There's also the possibility that they're just noodling and having fun.

555
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Yeah.

556
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
They're like, I love this new band.

557
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
And they're like, I guess we need to...

558
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
It's not ready yet.

559
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,520
I guess we need to start a band now, girl.

560
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
It is a little presumptuous, right?

561
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
It's not being played for your enjoyment.

562
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
What if it's just a guy with weird sneezes?

563
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Or a very, very lonely one-man band.

564
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
You knock on the door like, I love your stuff.

565
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
And he's like, thanks.

566
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm going to walk to the kitchen sadly now.

567
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,520
That's my impression of what a one-man band sounds like.

568
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Thanks.

569
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Before I would make this leap, I would need to know what the music of every band in the

570
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
world sounds like to make sure they're not playing a CD.

571
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Oh, my God.

572
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I would need to know with 100% certainty this is a new sound, new creation, new band.

573
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Because I do not want to open up the door and be like, dude, this is fucking sick.

574
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
And they're like, it's Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young?

575
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
It's John Philip Sousa.

576
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
John Philip Sousa?

577
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Yeah, I guess it's good.

578
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
How did you get a key?

579
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Can I borrow it?

580
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Can I borrow your John Philip Sousa CD?

581
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I don't think you need to be...

582
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
I was streaming it.

583
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Can I borrow your computer?

584
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I don't think you need to be a student of music to know when someone's laying it down

585
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,520
like they're in the studio versus they're in their apartment trying to learn Master of

586
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Puppets because it was on Stranger Things.

587
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
But you accept Mountain Goats, you know?

588
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Yeah, you can't tell the difference between professional band Mountain Goats and just some dudes.

589
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Someone plays early Mountain Goats through their wall, you're not going to know if it's

590
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
really someone playing guitar or not.

591
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
But that's why we like it.

592
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.

593
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,520
You love that scuffed shit.

594
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Hear that, John Darnell?

595
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
We love that scuffed shit.

596
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Keep it coming, baby.

597
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
You know, he's writing books now.

598
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Like, leave some for the rest of us.

599
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Yeah, right.

600
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Dude.

601
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Dude.

602
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Finally, someone's putting him in his place.

603
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Somebody's finally putting that stinker John Darnell in his place.

604
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Another question?

605
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah, please.

606
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm about to start flight school to become a pilot.

607
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah.

608
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
While this is an exciting step in my career, I have a problem.

609
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,520
I am terrified of heights.

610
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I have a practice flight coming up and I really don't want to spend it slumped down my seat

611
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
mortified and scrambling for a barf bag.

612
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Bad first impression.

613
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,520
What are some ways I can overcome this fear and walk into this first flight cool as a

614
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,520
cucumber showing them I'm super chill about heights and flying around in them?

615
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
That's from my stomach.

616
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Would rather be a train conductor.

617
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Are you from Mapleton?

618
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Are you that narrows it down?

619
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Because they're a little bit embarrassed that they're trying to be a pilot when they're

620
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
afraid of heights.

621
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeah.

622
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,520
And they didn't realize it until they heard a stranger say it out loud.

623
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
But to be fair, I was thinking about it, right?

624
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Okay.

625
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Well, two of us have almost theater degrees.

626
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
You almost have a theater degree.

627
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I have a theater degree.

628
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
I have a theater degree.

629
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I thought you switched to journalism.

630
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
No.

631
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,520
No, I have a minor in journalism and I use neither.

632
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Thank you.

633
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I went to college for five years because I have failed Spanish.

634
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I was able to, before going to college for a theater degree, act in stuff.

635
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,520
You know what you don't get to do before going to flight school?

636
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Fly a plane to see if you like it.

637
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,520
But you know, they didn't discover the first time they went up in the big beautiful sky,

638
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
like, oh, I hate this.

639
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
I wish I hadn't picked this as my job forever.

640
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I have to assume you have a parent or overbearing grandfather who is a pilot,

641
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
who was like, this is the life for you.

642
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
It's unfathomable.

643
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Other than astronaut, you have picked the most up job that you could possibly have.

644
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Yeah.

645
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Maybe those people that do those fucking Red Bull halo jumps are a little bit higher than you.

646
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,520
At least they're like, I'm headed down.

647
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm going down.

648
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Yeah, I'm going down.

649
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I want to fix this.

650
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Also, once they're in the plane, not up to them until you reach that point.

651
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Yeah.

652
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
A pilot, you're just there the whole way.

653
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Just up, up, up, up, up.

654
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
You can't zone out as far as I know.

655
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I don't know why you would try to have such an up job if you don't like up.

656
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah.

657
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
But I will say this.

658
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,520
In a plane, it's not really like you're going to fall.

659
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,520
You're not going to fall out of the plane.

660
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
In a perfect world.

661
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
In a perfect world, yes.

662
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,520
If you are, if you find yourself falling from a plane,

663
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,520
there has been a bigger whoopsie doodle that has happened.

664
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:18,520
In that context, though, I do want the pilot to be afraid of not being up anymore.

665
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Yeah.

666
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,520
That fear is healthy, right?

667
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I don't want a pilot who's like, I don't know, man, up, down.

668
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
It's all the same to me.

669
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Yeah.

670
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I want you to have a healthy, healthy man.

671
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Hey, what do you guys want?

672
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Let's show our hands.

673
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
You guys want up or down?

674
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Up or down.

675
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,520
It don't make any difference to yours truly.

676
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I'm chill either way.

677
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Either way is fine.

678
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Who wants to see the stars?

679
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I can go further up.

680
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I can go further down.

681
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
You know what I hate?

682
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Radio towers.

683
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,520
What's the number one piece of advice you give someone who's afraid of heights?

684
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
What's that?

685
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Don't look down.

686
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Yeah.

687
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
That is also good advice for a pilot.

688
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Keep looking forward.

689
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Because if you spend the whole flight looking out the window, they have those, right?

690
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
They probably have a cool name for them.

692
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
You're going the wrong direction, you're going reverse Sully, you're hitting the geese,

693
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
you're going down.

694
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Yeah.

695
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
You got to look in front for geese the whole time.

696
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
But the problem is that Sully was looking in front of him, saw the geese, and was like,

697
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
I'm going to get those motherfuckers.

698
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
You think you're so cool, geese?

699
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
I'm a plain geese.

700
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Get out of my way.

701
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Oh, yeah?

702
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Okay.

703
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
You bet I won't.

704
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Okay.

705
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
They don't talk about that enough in the movie.

706
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
No, they don't.

707
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Tom Hanks is there, and he's like, I'm a perfect angel.

708
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,520
When really that dude was like, fuck these geese up.

709
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
I lost at bar trivia last night.

710
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
I'm fucking pissed.

711
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Did that happen in the movie?

712
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I'm going to shred these geese.

713
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I need to watch Sully.

714
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Yeah, it's a sick film.

715
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
You ever seen it?

716
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
No, I've never seen it.

717
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
So anyway, let me set it up.

718
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Can we be serious now?

719
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
That's my impression of Tom Hanks and Sully.

720
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Yeah.

721
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
I'm going to stick with it, if I can say.

722
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
It was really good.

723
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Can we be serious?

724
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I can't do it a second time.

725
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,020
But the first time I think we can all agree sounded a lot like Thomas Hanks.

726
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,520
No arguments here.

727
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:20,920
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

728
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,520
I just had to, I got to read this verbatim.

729
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm sorry.

730
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
It's like, I'm sorry.

731
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll just read it verbatim.

732
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,400
If your power is a dream, then make the dream take flight.

733
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,920
You and Squarespace are going to make it all right.

734
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,800
Just a few clicks and key presses, all that you need.

735
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,240
Whether you're making a good website or a bad website.

736
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,520
Hi, Justin McElroy here.

737
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,800
Squarespace will let you make good websites.

738
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,200
They make it easy to make good websites, make tools that are simple to use, even if you're

739
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,720
not an expert, drag and drop, beautiful, easy to make a great website.

740
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,120
But what a lot of people won't tell you is that you are allowed to make a bad website

741
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
with Squarespace.

742
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,560
They will not step in and forbid you.

743
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,440
They don't make it easy because everything's so beautiful and they have such great customer

744
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
support.

745
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,780
And there's a Squarespace video studio that makes videos easy and you can sell products

746
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,200
with a physical or digital.

747
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,440
Squarespace has all those tools.

748
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,560
So like they don't make it easy to make a bad website.

749
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,120
But if you want to make a bad website, they're not going to stop you.

750
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,160
So fulfill your dream with Squarespace, whether your site is good or bad.

751
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,800
Head on over to squarespace.com slash my brother, or you'll make me sad.

752
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,800
There's a free trial when you're ready to launch, use offer code my brother to save

753
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,200
10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

754
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,640
Squarespace, you can make a bad one if you want.

755
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,600
Hey there, quick favor to ask.

756
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,560
Will you help us out by taking a five minute survey at maximumfund.org slash survey?

757
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,440
As you know, most of the support for Max Fund comes directly from folks like you.

758
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,380
But many of our shows and our network also rely on limited advertising for some revenue.

759
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,660
This survey helps us attract advertisers that are a good fit for the audiences of our shows.

760
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,700
And it helps many of our hosts secure a bit of extra income.

761
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,600
It should only take a few minutes to complete and you'll get a discount at Max Fund store

762
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,880
when you do.

763
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
That's maximumfund.org slash survey.

764
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
Thanks.

765
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm Lisa Hanawalt, and I'm Emily Heller.

766
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,760
Nine years ago, we started a podcast to try and learn something new every episode.

767
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,800
Things have gone a little off the rails since then.

768
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:09,080
Tune in to hear about low stakes, neighborhood drama, gardening, the sordid nasty underbelly

769
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,360
of the horse girl lifestyle, hot sauce, addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrity culture.

770
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,800
And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find on Wikipedia.org.

771
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,480
We'll read all of it no matter how gross.

772
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,080
There's something for everyone on our podcast, Baby Geniuses.

773
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,000
Hosted by us, two horny adult idiots.

774
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,320
Hang out with us as we try and fail to retain any knowledge at all.

775
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:45,600
Every other week on Maximum Fun.

776
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
This can't be right.

777
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,880
A haunted doll watch?

778
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm trying to do a show.

779
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Did you all see that Vulture did a write up about the white wine, about this new drink

780
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
that I invented?

781
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
The drink of the summer, you mean?

782
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,520
The drink of the summer, they called it.

783
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
That's not it.

784
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Look it up.

785
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
All right.

786
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Yeah.

787
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
You already did that.

788
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Yeah.

789
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
OK.

790
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,880
Today we're going to be kind of zooming in, focusing in on one particular purveyor of

791
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,280
haunted dolls, and that is haunted honeys.

792
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
So this is really a haunt.

793
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,680
I don't think that's how you spell honeys.

794
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,280
Yeah, it is on.

795
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm looking at eBay.

796
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I mean, that's haunted honeys.

797
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, but it's haunted honeys.

798
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm looking at it.

799
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No, but I mean, it might be spelled that way, but I'm just telling you anyway.

800
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
OK.

801
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Travis, we get it.

802
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They spelled it in a different way.

803
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
OK.

804
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Let's...

805
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Welcome to the stage, Stella.

806
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
All right.

807
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All right.

808
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Hold on.

809
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Wait a minute.

810
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Is that a promo code at the top?

811
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Did that get cut off, or is it really fucking 5% off?

812
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
What do you want?

813
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,280
There's slim margins here, pal.

814
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,400
So this paranormal doll, 70s, neutral.

815
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Please read.

816
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Neutral?

817
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,480
This doll was part of a paranormal study.

818
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,160
You will receive the physical doll.

819
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
I should hope so.

820
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,920
Hey, stop that.

821
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,600
This is Stella.

822
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,040
She's in her 70s.

823
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,080
Oh, she looks great.

824
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Yeah.

825
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,720
Well, her vessel is 16 inches tall.

826
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,480
Stella was not very happy with me getting her at first.

827
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
What?

828
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,600
Why would she be happy when I purchase her on the eBay service?

829
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,240
I think once she saw the other spirits here, she realized she'll be OK.

830
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,120
Stella passed away in the late 1800s.

831
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
She thought...

832
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Wait.

833
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
She's how old?

834
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
She...

835
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Well, she's dead.

836
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
But how...

837
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,440
Oh, so according to the Haunted Honey, she does not continue to age after that.

838
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Correct.

839
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
So she's 70s.

840
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Forever.

841
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Yeah.

842
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Cool.

843
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
She thought many times that her life was going to end.

844
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,920
Then all of a sudden, she would get better.

845
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Sure.

846
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Sure.

847
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I bet there was a lot of that in the 18...

848
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Yeah, you know what?

849
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,760
I bet pretty much everybody in the 1800s had a moment where they're like, oh, I fell down

850
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
once.

851
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
This is it, I guess.

852
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Wait.

853
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
You guys heard about all the diseases?

854
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Yeah.

855
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
I fell down at work and now my arm is green.

856
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,480
I guess this is it.

857
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Nope.

858
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Cool.

859
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
So you've talked to Grandpa Dan already.

860
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,240
If you knew the story, you should have just said something.

861
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
I think...

862
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
OK.

863
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,480
Stella had many near-death experiences throughout her life.

864
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,360
She lives in a void of paper towels.

865
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,320
I don't think a near-death experience is when you think you're going to be fit and you're

866
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
like, ah, never mind.

867
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,600
I'm getting better.

868
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,000
She was known to be a bit of a careless daredevil in her younger years.

869
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
OK.

870
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I can see that.

871
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
Stella is neutral, but that doesn't mean she's not friendly.

872
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
No.

873
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,040
Neutral or bitter is very friendly.

874
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Yeah.

875
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,240
She's just got somewhat of a temperamental personality.

876
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,600
Then that's not neutral.

877
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,120
She likes things to go her way, lol.

878
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
She enjoys...

879
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Wait.

880
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Wait.

881
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Because she...

882
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Well, doesn't everyone?

883
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
No.

884
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Why the lol after that sentence?

885
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Because she's like sassy, lol.

886
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,040
But we're talking about a ghost.

887
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,600
She enjoys a spot in the living room next to the cute decorations.

888
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,160
She enjoys judging my company, lol.

889
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,460
She works great with any divination tools.

890
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,280
She's not really picky over gifts.

891
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,460
She likes everything from jewelry to flowers.

892
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,280
When you get her, don't forget to give her a gift and light a white candle with some

893
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,960
incense to welcome her.

894
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,120
I don't want to be pedantic, but jewelry to flowers is not a good scale of things.

895
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,600
It's all the gifts that there are.

896
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Between jewelry and flowers.

897
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm sorry, everyone.

898
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,320
This is a boring ass doll.

899
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Neutral.

900
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Well, maybe...

901
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
I want something spicy.

902
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Maybe our...

903
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Maybe Jenga will be more to your liking.

904
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,200
Now Jenga I can get into.

905
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Welcome to...

906
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Yes!

907
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
No!

908
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Baby!

909
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Yes, baby!

910
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Branded as shit!

911
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,800
$35 with 15% off using the code Haunted15.

912
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,040
I do believe I will, thank you very much.

913
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,720
This doll was part of a paranormal study.

914
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,560
You will receive the physical doll.

915
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Yes.

916
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
This is Jenga.

917
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Yeah!

918
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Yeah, it is.

919
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,560
His age is unknown, but his vessel is nine inches tall.

920
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Wink.

921
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Oh, a little guy!

922
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
Wait, is there a wink in there?

923
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Nope.

924
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,160
Jenga is in his mid-20s, except he is dead.

925
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,520
He's a friendly little guy.

926
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,800
He was sent to me from Canada.

927
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
The lady that had him felt he may be negative.

928
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,240
She sent me photos and videos of him, and I assured him he's positive.

929
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,160
But she wanted him gone.

930
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Did they do your butt backwards, Jenga?

931
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,400
Maybe his butt was knocked backwards when Jenga was hit walking along the side of the

932
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
road.

933
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,360
He was hit so hard, his butt was knocked.

934
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,480
His butt switched sides with his privacy.

935
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
We've all been there.

936
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,880
That was my favorite Grey's Anatomy episode.

937
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
I really-

938
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,200
We can save you, but your butt's always going to be on the front.

939
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
It's okay.

940
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I still love you.

941
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
And nothing but.

942
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I still love you.

943
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Dr. McPoop's weird.

944
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
I think it's going to be okay.

945
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,400
I really believe that Jenga was a photographer.

946
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,280
Does Jenga sit on the toilet like a cool teacher?

947
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,400
Hey, we've had a lot of fun here today, but you know what's not fun?

948
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,800
How does this doll poop?

949
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,600
When I did his reading, I got a vision of him walking beside the road with a camera

950
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,640
in hand, presumably moments before he was tragically killed, I guess.

951
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,360
He's definitely got a very artistic side for a doll.

952
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,240
He gets along great with all others, and pets just adore him.

953
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,200
I bet they do.

954
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,240
He loves- this sentence has never been written before.

955
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,720
He loves any type of art as an offering, and he also likes green candy.

956
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,880
Oh, my two turn-ons, easy, fine art and green candy.

957
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,080
When you get in, don't forget to give a gift and some incense to welcome him.

958
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,720
I do love how his hair has a natural windswept look.

959
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Sure.

960
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,880
Such a festive- such a festive doll.

961
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,720
But let's take a moment, if we may, to meet a new friend.

962
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Hold on.

963
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Wait for it.

964
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Wait.

965
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Hold on.

966
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Hi, Miguel.

967
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Shit.

968
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Oh, boy.

969
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Paul-

970
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,120
Now, why is Miguel worth $3 more, do you think?

971
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,040
This is Miguel.

972
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
He is a teenager.

973
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Griffin, can you just read the, like, four descriptive terms there?

974
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,720
Paul, if you'd go back.

975
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,800
Paranormal doll, haunted honey's Miguel, M45, teen, positive, very sweet, clingy.

976
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,560
That sounds like the description of a relationship.

977
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,080
Like, at first, he was a teen and really positive and so sweet.

978
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
So sweet.

979
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
But he got a little clingy.

980
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,320
A little clingy when college rolled around.

981
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
This is Miguel.

982
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,280
He's a teenager, and his vessel is nine inches tall.

983
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,080
Yeah, it is.

984
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Finally.

985
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Finally.

986
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,520
This guy is ready to find his forever home.

987
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:18,760
Every time I would ask him if he was ready, I would get a strong no.

988
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,320
Please don't sell me, mama.

989
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,600
Please, mama.

990
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
It's time, Miguel.

991
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
No, no.

992
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,040
This is my forever home.

993
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,560
You're ready to find your forever home.

994
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,720
I found my forever home.

995
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,860
I need $38 for cigarettes.

996
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
So this is a challenge-

997
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
Mama.

998
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Mama.

999
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,360
Can I sit on the chair?

1000
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,520
Yes, Miguel.

1001
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,400
This is a challenging sentence.

1002
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,800
He has seen some of the updates from other spirits that got adopted in their new homes,

1003
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
and he's ready.

1004
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,960
I thought he just said no.

1005
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah, but now he's finally ready.

1006
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
And this does-

1007
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I was on the forums on Reddit.

1008
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
It looks great.

1009
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah.

1010
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,480
Is your doll on the internet?

1011
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,720
Are you-

1012
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Do you have screen time?

1013
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,680
Not the internet, as we know it.

1014
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Okay.

1015
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Sort of a ethereal bae.

1016
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
All right.

1017
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,160
He has seen some updates.

1018
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
He's ready.

1019
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
He's seen some shit.

1020
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,320
He had a tough time in the home I got him from, and that had him scared.

1023
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
What?

1024
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,160
Well, Miguel passed away in the 1950s.

1025
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,880
He was a very energetic teen and known to be a daredevil.

1026
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,880
And when he ate spicy food, he turned into a car.

1027
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,520
He was a very energetic teen, and he was known to be a daredevil.

1028
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,640
He jumped out the window of the abandoned house down his street and ended up breaking

1029
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
his neck.

1030
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,200
And folks, I'm here to tell you, that'll do it every time.

1031
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,400
I love that version of It's a Wonderful Life, where it's like, I'm going to buy that house

1032
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,640
and live in it when we get older and married.

1033
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
He's like, oh, yeah?

1034
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,520
Well, check this shit out.

1035
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Ooh, crack.

1036
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,160
Murray, you got to call someone married.

1037
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
I'm actually going to go.

1038
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
I can't.

1039
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
I got some prior.

1040
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
What?

1041
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Joseph?

1042
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Did that man just die?

1043
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Dude, job's off.

1044
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
You're good, Clarence.

1045
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
He went hardcore this time.

1046
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
One, two, three, and fuck it.

1047
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
So he jumped out the window.

1048
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:25,240
He just a very, such an energetic teen that he is a daredevil.

1049
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,680
Like a daredevil is one thing, right?

1050
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
We all know what that means.

1051
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,680
I don't think it means, hey, check this out.

1052
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,000
I do think, listen, once again, stupid abandonment.

1053
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,360
Hey, you guys want to see a dead body?

1054
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Cool.

1055
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,440
Once again, not to be pathetic, I think a daredevil has to at least survive one thing.

1056
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Sure.

1057
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,720
He got to do one thing.

1058
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,760
Oh, man.

1059
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,140
So he broke his neck.

1060
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,440
He was so surprised.

1061
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
He was so surprised.

1062
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Yeah.

1063
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
No, not about that.

1064
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Okay.

1065
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Not about that.

1066
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
What?

1067
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,000
Well, I thought I could stick that shit.

1068
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,040
He was surprised to see all the gifts and people who showed up to support and honor

1069
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,880
him at his funeral, which like after the dumb shit he pulled, I get it, I guess.

1070
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,000
I wouldn't be surprised if people showed up for me too.

1071
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,680
Miguel is very sweet.

1072
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,080
He will bond deeply with anyone who shows him kindness.

1073
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,880
He works great with any divination tools.

1074
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,280
He enjoys going through the home.

1075
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,000
Great at Adobe.

1076
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,680
Making little tipping and clacking noises.

1077
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,640
When you get him home, don't forget to give him a gift and light a white candle with some

1078
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,760
incense to welcome him.

1079
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,680
And I am only reading this end part that's at the end of all the posts because we're

1080
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,880
coming up on the end of the show here in a little bit.

1081
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,040
Follow Haunted Honeys on Instagram and TikTok.

1082
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Thank you.

1083
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Yes.

1084
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,240
But hey, listen, as somebody who's been by there, who ducked his head in a little bit

1085
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:58,160
earlier today, you better really be sure that you want to check in a lot of these on TikTok.

1086
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Okay?

1087
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Uh-huh.

1088
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,360
And don't leave weird comments because I'm tired of people selling dolls, putting notes

1089
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,800
in the boxes that are like, I checked out your podcast, it was really funny.

1090
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,640
And then they have my home address and I don't like that.

1091
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,080
So please stop talking to the people who sell the dolls, everyone.

1092
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,520
Anyway, that's our Haunted Doll Watch.

1093
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Thank you for that.

1094
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,640
Let's, let's take it to the streets with some live audience questions.

1095
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,320
We have prepared a list of people we're going to call you down.

1096
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,600
Please do not approach the microphone.

1097
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
Oh, bye Justin.

1098
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Hello.

1099
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Yeah.

1100
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Um, my name's Laurie.

1101
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
I go by she, her.

1102
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Hi Laurie.

1103
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
Hi Laurie.

1104
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:45,400
And my question is, I wrote a steamy alien romance book and I need a title for it.

1105
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,720
Can you give us, yeah, like a paragraph synopsis?

1106
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,800
Imagine being in the back and, and getting all worked up.

1107
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,920
What sort of the, you know, what's the summation?

1108
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,480
It's about this girl who gets kidnapped by aliens, well, abducted, I guess is the right

1109
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
term.

1110
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Yeah.

1111
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Sure.

1112
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
That's the term they prefer.

1113
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Yeah.

1114
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,160
But you're the writer, of course, any word choice that you want to go with?

1115
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Okay.

1116
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Go ahead.

1117
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Spin your web.

1118
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,320
Yeah, that's true.

1119
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:28,960
And then, so she escapes the aliens and becomes a bounty hunter, but then she falls in love

1120
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,240
with an alien, um, who she's supposed to capture and they have a fun time together.

1121
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:46,080
So the first two that occurred to me is beam me up lover and booty bounty 2099.

1122
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,320
Booty bounty 2099, is that what you said?

1123
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Yeah.

1124
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Okay.

1125
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Is it set near 2099?

1126
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Could it be?

1127
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Could it be set near 2099?

1128
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
It could be.

1129
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Yeah.

1130
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
It's 77 years from now.

1131
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
Are you sure?

1132
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,520
Hey, Griffin, you can't assume that aliens use the same calendar we do.

1133
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Yeah, that's fair.

1134
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
That's so weird.

1135
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,920
We're actually on the same month, 77 years difference.

1136
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,680
It's also January.

1137
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Then what about closer encounters?

1138
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,680
Oh, that's good.

1139
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,760
I like that one.

1140
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:37,000
Or it could be close encounters of the fourth kind, which is doing it.

1141
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,620
What about probe me regular?

1142
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,840
What about probe me globular?

1143
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,540
Is the characters name globular and it's important to ask, get your hands on me, you bitch.

1144
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:01,860
Is he a big gelatinous sphere that you can climb inside and be transported into an dimension

1145
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
of X?

1146
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,120
Let me finish!

1147
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
Area 69.

1148
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:18,840
And here's the thing, I know I just said it.

1149
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,320
There's no way that's not taken.

1150
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,000
What about, no, seriously, welcome to earth.

1151
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What about cocoon two?

1152
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,400
Actually, I think it's already a movie.

1153
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,280
What about cocoon three?

1154
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,800
One of those has got to help, right?

1155
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
What about Uranus?

1156
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Call my, am I right?

1157
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Yeah.

1158
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Okay.

1159
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Thank you very much.

1160
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
Thank you.

1161
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:57,160
Also, if you use any of those TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM.

1162
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,160
Hello.

1163
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Hi, I'm Erin.

1164
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Hi, Erin.

1165
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,360
My question is immediately actionable.

1166
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
Yeah, please, please.

1167
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,440
So before the show, I was playing with my fidget because I got ADHD, so I got it on

1168
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,440
your baby.

1169
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
And I did.

1170
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,440
I have dropped it on my face before.

1171
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
Okay.

1172
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,440
I dropped it.

1173
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
It is an orb.

1174
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,680
It is a crystal orb and it rolled forward and I thought I'd never see it again, but

1175
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,960
I figured I'd toss out into the audience.

1176
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
Who's got the orb?

1177
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Who's got the orb?

1178
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
Who's got the orb?

1179
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,960
Jesus Christ.

1180
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
The orb made it so far.

1181
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,960
Erin, the orb went.

1182
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Wait, Erin, where were you sitting?

1183
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,960
I was sitting in the back.

1184
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
Erin, where were you sitting?

1185
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
The very back.

1186
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
The very back?

1187
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
The very back?

1188
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
That little orb.

1189
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
It was like the fucking forest goat feather.

1190
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1191
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
I have to know.

1192
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
I have to know.

1193
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
It was like the beach ball stuff.

1194
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,400
Raise your hand if something bumped your foot during the show.

1195
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Now hold on.

1196
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Now hold on.

1197
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
There's a record.

1198
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I have so many questions.

1199
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
The voyage of the boy.

1200
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
An incredible journey.

1201
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Can you approach the microphone please?

1202
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,680
I need to know the story of the person who orb rolled up to your feet.

1203
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,480
And you were like, hmm, free orb.

1204
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,800
No, but wouldn't this be wild if it's a different orb?

1205
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
I would not.

1206
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,000
No, that's not mine.

1207
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's a different orb.

1208
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is that the correct orb?

1209
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,480
It is the correct orb.

1210
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,480
It's the right orb.

1211
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,480
We got the orb back in Erin's hands everybody.

1212
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Yes.

1213
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,480
Hey, big cheer.

1214
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,960
You'll love to see it.

1215
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,920
I love it.

1216
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,640
We need to do more of those, by the way.

1217
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,920
We've never done lost and found audience questions.

1218
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
I love that.

1219
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
It's really great.

1220
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,920
You know what I like?

1221
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
No jokes required.

1222
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Yeah.

1223
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah.

1224
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,920
And it does something good.

1225
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,920
Okay.

1226
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Next up.

1227
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
Hello.

1228
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Approach the microphone.

1229
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Welcome.

1230
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Welcome.

1231
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Hi.

1232
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
My name is Kaylee.

1233
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Hi, Kaylee.

1234
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Hi, Kaylee.

1235
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,320
Me and my fiancé are getting married next year, and he's pretty insistent that we cut

1236
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
our wedding cake with a sword.

1237
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Yeah.

1238
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Hell yeah.

1239
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
You only...

1240
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Okay.

1241
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,320
And I keep trying to tell him no.

1242
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Why?

1243
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
Yeah.

1244
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
I agree.

1245
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
What?

1246
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
No.

1247
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Kaylee needs our support right now.

1248
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
Okay.

1249
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
It seems great.

1250
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Here's the problem, right?

1251
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
No.

1252
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
Was that the rest of the question?

1253
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Sorry, Kaylee.

1254
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
How do I tell him no?

1256
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Yeah.

1257
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
He actually listens.

1258
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,320
I...

1259
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
You cut...

1260
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Think about it, folks.

1261
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
You cut the cake with the sword once.

1262
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,320
Great.

1263
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,320
But you got to cut a lot of slices of cake.

1264
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Sure.

1265
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,400
Kaylee, you're just sitting there with a sword like a doofus, cutting small slices with a

1266
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,560
sword, and you look ridiculous.

1267
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:33,440
I will say, at mine and Rachel's wedding, it was like 20 degrees outside, and we could

1268
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,600
not get through our cake.

1269
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:45,880
And had I known in the moment that having a fucking Hattori Hanzo steel was an option,

1270
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,000
I would have taken it.

1271
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,240
Now, I'm getting...

1272
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,320
This isn't funny, but have a groom's cake that your groom can cut with a sword.

1273
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Can fuck up like a doofus.

1274
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,920
You're going to want to have two.

1275
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,080
Like you do at a one-year-old's birthday party, you know?

1276
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
Yeah.

1277
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,920
This one's just for him, everybody.

1278
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Let him have his fun.

1279
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,980
Yeah.

1280
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:16,000
One cool thing that you could do is say absolutely, and then when he rears back and he's like

1281
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,880
swings forward, you pull out a short sword, block him.

1282
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Hell yeah, dude.

1283
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
No, wait.

1284
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Okay.

1285
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
I am immortal.

1286
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,480
I have inside me blood of kings.

1287
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,800
And then long eye contact.

1288
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Not today.

1289
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
And then it's...

1290
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
That's first dance right there, baby.

1291
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Yeah.

1292
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Yeah.

1293
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
I don't know what happens after that.

1294
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
Maybe I'll sword fight or get hurt or something.

1295
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,480
Then you throw sand in his eyes.

1296
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,480
Yeah.

1297
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,480
That's good.

1298
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
No.

1299
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
No.

1300
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Icing sugar.

1301
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Icing sugar.

1302
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,520
And then you hook onto the roof and then you run away.

1303
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,520
You stab him.

1304
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
You cut his head off.

1305
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,520
Cut off his fucking head.

1306
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,600
At a certain point, your stunt doubles have taken over.

1307
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
It's fine.

1308
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Yeah, yeah.

1309
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
You're not doing any more.

1310
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
This is all CG.

1311
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Does your...

1312
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,860
Do you have the budget to motion capture your...

1313
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,920
Does your fiance know how to use a sword?

1314
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,920
Not yet, no.

1315
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Okay.

1316
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
So let me tell you.

1317
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,360
It's not as easy as I make it look in the movies.

1318
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,640
And I know what you're...

1319
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,640
Are you here, fiance?

1320
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Yeah.

1321
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
Yeah.

1322
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Okay.

1323
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,640
I know you're thinking, big knife.

1324
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,640
It's different.

1325
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Now, listen.

1326
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,640
It's not going to be...

1327
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
Listen.

1328
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
No, no, no.

1329
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,600
Now, here we see Queen Elizabeth cutting a cake with a saber.

1330
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
I believe the wrong way.

1331
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
Yeah, the wrong...

1332
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Yeah, hey, guys.

1333
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Hey, guys.

1334
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,560
It actually looks like she's pointing to a part of the cake with the...

1335
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Right about here?

1336
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,560
Right about here.

1337
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Can we not...

1338
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,720
Can we not actually the Queen of England cutting a cake with a sword?

1339
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,160
I bet she probably knows what she's doing, right?

1340
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,160
Now, Justin, I'm sorry, but nothing about the Queen's face here is, I know what I'm

1341
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,160
doing.

1342
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,160
Step back, idiots.

1343
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Look at the guy in the pink striped tie in the background.

1344
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,200
Is everyone like, do you believe this?

1345
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Can I say...

1346
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,320
Okay, real quick about this guy.

1347
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,320
The Queen of England is cutting a cake with a sword?

1348
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,920
Fucking stand up and go check that shit out, man.

1349
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,960
How are you sitting there like, oh, this happens to me constantly?

1350
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,360
Okay, that guy is so thrilled beyond...

1351
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,920
That person has been big from a 12-year-old child to that age.

1352
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,240
Anyway, so sorry, Kaylee, but I do need to ask, do you think Queen Elizabeth has eaten

1353
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Taco Bell before?

1354
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
Probably not, right?

1355
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
No.

1356
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,240
No, probably not.

1357
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,640
What do you think she'd go with?

1358
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,040
Oh, if she did?

1359
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Yeah.

1360
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah.

1361
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,040
I think she'd go with the pink.

1362
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
For sure.

1363
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,040
Can I tell you?

1364
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
No joke.

1365
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,040
That was right there in my brain.

1366
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Okay.

1367
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
Has anything we've done today helped?

1368
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Yeah.

1369
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Okay.

1370
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,040
Thank you.

1371
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
Thank you, Kaylee.

1372
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Thank you, Kaylee.

1373
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Congratulations, everybody.

1374
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Congrats.

1375
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,280
We need to wrap up soon if they're going to get to Olive Garden.

1376
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
Yes.

1377
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
Charles, make it snappy.

1378
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Okay.

1379
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
Hi, Charles.

1380
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
I'm Charles.

1381
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
He him.

1382
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Hi, Charles.

1383
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,040
I tried to get my surgical instructor not to fail me after I made her listen to ska for

1384
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,240
the entire duration of a seven-hour surgery.

1385
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,280
Now, wait, Charles, here's my question.

1386
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Sure.

1387
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,080
Have they expressed to you frustration about this?

1388
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,480
Four hours in, they looked at me, and were kind of like—

1389
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
Four hours?

1390
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,560
They made it four fucking hours, huh, Charles?

1391
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,440
It kind of plays low in the background because they don't want it to be distracting, but

1392
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,360
at a particularly long trumpet solo, they looked at me and were like, this is interesting.

1393
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Yeah, sure.

1394
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Now, hold on, Charles.

1395
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Hold on.

1396
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,360
You all have—

1397
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Is it possible that—

1398
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
Hey, wait, wait, real quick.

1399
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,360
I need to know if this is a universal experience.

1400
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:49,600
Have you ever played music for a gathering or a group of people or just one person, and

1401
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,720
you get to a point in the music where you're like, they're not going to like this?

1402
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Yes.

1403
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,880
I'm seeing a lot of nodding like, oh, man, this is really grating.

1404
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,080
I really wish this would sink back into the background.

1405
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,680
I feel really weird about this now.

1406
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,680
I want to quit.

1407
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,680
Can we quit?

1408
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,680
Charles?

1409
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Charles?

1410
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:11,640
Someone, while you're performing surgery, saying, well, this is interesting.

1411
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,200
Is it possible it was not music-related at all?

1412
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,240
What were you doing in that moment with your hands?

1413
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,440
I was just standing there holding the retractor uncomfortably, sweating, because I—

1414
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
How uncomfortably?

1415
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
What's a retractor?

1416
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1417
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
Sorry, sorry.

1418
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,040
Were you skanking it while you were holding the retractor, because that will, that is

1419
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,480
no good, my friend.

1420
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,280
That goes right against that Hippocratic Oath.

1421
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:45,480
The Hippocratic Oath should say, do no harm, and also, when someone is open, don't skank

1422
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,620
it right next to them.

1423
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,620
Skanking is generally discouraging.

1424
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:56,480
Are you kind of a loose cannon surgeon, who like, scaw powers you through?

1425
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:04,200
Have you ever had to knock on wood?

1426
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,840
What's great is you could, you know, there could be like a, you know, I don't know much

1427
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,840
about medicine, but like an aorta explodes.

1428
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,480
I know less about scaw.

1429
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah, right?

1430
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,400
But an aorta explodes while you're doing heart surgery, and it's like, the pressure is on,

1431
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,600
and then you can just look at the like, commanding surgeon, officer, and just be like, pick it

1432
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,600
up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

1433
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:34,200
This man needs mouth to mouth, as you trombone into his mouth.

1434
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,000
Trombone in his mouth, yeah.

1435
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,240
Trombone into my mouth is.

1436
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,800
That's a good name for your book, if you can have an alien play trombone.

1437
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,440
From the creators of Call Me By Your Name.

1438
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,000
Charles, I've lost the plot.

1439
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,960
How can we help here?

1440
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,280
Hey, go to your commanding surgical officer, Griffon Assange.

1441
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,080
As Griffon has said, yeah.

1442
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,100
Did you know Oscar Isaac was in a scaw band before he became famous?

1443
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,760
You're going to change the story.

1444
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,760
Sure.

1445
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
He was in the Blinking Underdogs.

1446
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,080
This is true.

1447
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
I'm just a big fan.

1448
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,080
Their music rules.

1449
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah.

1450
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
Sure.

1451
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,840
What are some of your favorite scaw bands?

1452
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,720
Everyone in the room.

1453
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,560
Did they pull through?

1454
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Oh, yeah.

1455
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
The surgery went great.

1456
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,560
Great.

1457
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,600
You can't say, oh, yeah, like it's obvious.

1458
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,600
From what I understand.

1459
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,800
It was seven hours long.

1460
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,040
Charles was behind the retractor.

1461
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,400
Of course it went smooth.

1462
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,400
Yeah, sure.

1463
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,240
Nothing detracted when it wasn't supposed to.

1464
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,560
Did the patient wake up and was like, what the fuck was that?

1465
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Because I loved it.

1466
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:49,280
You have my brain open and I got that shit without the radiation shielding of my skull

1467
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
and skin.

1468
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,200
And you're not supposed to.

1469
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,480
I will say I followed up on them over the past several days and they have seemed pretty

1470
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
chill.

1471
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Okay.

1472
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Wait.

1473
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
The patient?

1474
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Yeah.

1475
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Yeah.

1476
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
Nailed it.

1477
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,480
Yeah.

1478
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,480
I mean, you crushed it.

1479
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
Did that happen?

1480
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Now, you know what it sounds like now.

1481
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
You got to write a paper about scaw, my man.

1482
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
Yeah.

1483
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,240
The power of scaw.

1484
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,720
And don't research it anymore.

1485
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
You have all the evidence you need.

1486
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
You did it.

1487
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Trust me.

1488
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,720
Does that help, Charles?

1489
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Yes.

1490
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,720
Thank you.

1491
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,720
Thank you.

1492
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,720
Thank you.

1493
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Goodbye.

1494
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,720
Thank you.

1495
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:41,560
This is, I don't know, Salt Lake City has, this is our second show here, it is so fun

1496
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
every time.

1497
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
Yeah.

1498
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,280
We all get so rowdy and I'm so excited to be here.

1499
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,840
I'm very, very here for it.

1500
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Thank you.

1501
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Thank you.

1502
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Thank you.

1503
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:55,440
Thank you very much, Salt Lake City.

1504
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,480
And all the usual thank yous.

1505
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Thank you.

1506
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,240
A huge thank you to Schmanners.

1507
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,000
Thank you to Paul Saboren of Paul and Storm fame.

1508
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,560
Thank you to the Abravanel Theater for having us.

1509
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,680
This is our second show here and it's absolutely gorgeous.

1510
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,120
Thank you to Tyler Reed for the amazing posters.

1511
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,120
Yes.

1512
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,000
Grab yourself a poster on your way out if there are still some.

1513
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,760
Thank you to Rachel, yes, for manning the ones and twos over there recording our audio.

1514
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Sometimes even the threes.

1515
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,760
Yeah.

1516
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,760
I know.

1517
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,760
It got wild.

1518
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Clinton McElroy.

1519
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,560
You all know him?

1520
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,640
And Carol McElroy, our stepmom, Carol is here too to make sure he doesn't wander into traffic.

1521
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,080
That's always nice to have.

1522
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,480
Oh, thanks to Montaigne.

1523
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,560
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

1524
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,840
Thank you to Matt.

1525
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Oh, sorry.

1526
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,080
Listen, if we don't get them out of here in the next minute, they're going to knock it

1527
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,080
to Olive Garden.

1528
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Thank you, that's going to do it.

1529
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Yeah.

1530
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,960
So Griff, just real quick, just a quick, real quick impression of Grandpa Dan ordering a

1531
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,080
naked chicken chalupa at Taco Bell.

1532
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,080
Easy.

1533
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,240
Can I have a naked, chomping, cheeky, chubo?

1534
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,240
My name is Justin McElroy.

1535
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,240
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1536
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:44,360
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1537
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:59,680
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
