1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,620
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made it my show for the modern era

9
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,620
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm your middle-aged brother

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,740
Yes, it's true I have a pretty new kitty

12
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,300
Is Olive or Olivia? Hello? I'm a pretty kitty. No, look at that special cat

13
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,220
Is that her real name Justin cuz we were told a different name yesterday. Well, she came home and her name was Olive and then

14
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,220
The girls decided Grizabella, you know the glamour cat, of course

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,580
Yeah, the cat from the hit movie that we all love that I love you love we all love. Yeah, it's in our blood and

16
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,500
Then I Sidney and I decided we're gonna keep calling her Olive

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,720
Protests which you usually don't do

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,700
To your kid. You don't usually do a protest. Well, it was gonna be an evening name. I

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,220
I see. After the kids were asleep. Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought you're saying the inverse

20
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,940
I thought you were saying in the evening time when the Jellicle cats

21
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,620
Historically do come out and prance. That is when she becomes Grizabella

22
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,940
Well, we I think we can agree that the only confusing thing about cats is

23
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,700
What is a Jellicle name? What's the human given name?

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,420
What is their chosen name right cuz it's three different one fucking kitty

25
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,860
Look at those little Toby because you can't tell me that like Jenny Annie dots

26
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,340
Is the same as like rumple teaser? Those are two different worlds at those names existent

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,860
Yeah, they can't look at that kitty. Is she changing color to match your shirt?

28
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,940
Is she a community wild if I had a chameleon kitty? She's so little

29
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,940
She's so little we record this show on video now and that's what happens is the cat comes hangs out sometimes

30
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,540
I guess I was sitting on your shoulder like a pretty little parrot

31
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,260
I guess sweet pair on feeble and she likes you which is nice. She's a nice change of paces to my other cat

32
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,980
Does she like me?

33
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,740
Like you let's say ask her. Hi, pretty. Oh, she loves Griffin

34
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,260
Beauty blogging me dad

35
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,100
All right, you got a beauty blog that kitty you're dismissed. Oh, it's gonna stay here on my lap

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,700
I guess yeah

37
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Mr. Biggles oh

38
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Yeah, do some

39
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:45,140
Mr. Biggles were no, mr. Bigglesworth. Oh, man. I shouldn't name how many bad cats how many bad?

40
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,620
Mystery like cats that were not not well-loved. Do you think we're named? Mr. Bigglesworth?

41
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:58,820
I just I you know right until this moment when you say how many bad cats or whatever and it made me think

42
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,700
What if like mr. Bigglesworth or like that cat that Blofeld's was always hanging out with what if they were really nice?

43
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,860
What if those cats were like no don't hurt them. Oh

44
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Couple of beauty babies like

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,660
Justin you went away. Yeah, it was distracting to everyone and we can't do our podcast

46
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,740
I want the kitty on the show instead of Justin there. I said it. I want three kitties on the show instead. Oh my god

47
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,580
Are you kidding me?

48
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,300
Not like my brother my brother me, but now that it's silence with occasional purse. It's good. It's a good show

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,980
Have you played that weird mod of stray where it's just three brother kitties and instead of exploring like a city much

50
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,140
Yeah, they're just recording a podcast. I love it. I don't reference turbo teen as much but

51
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Yeah, okay, cuz it's three pretty kitty boys. They talk about mice a lot more. Yeah

52
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,860
All right. Well, I feel like all the oxygen got sucked out of the room the moment the cattle. Yeah, definitely

53
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,460
We should just call this episode

54
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,980
This is this this is um, this is actually perfect. Oh

55
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,500
Okay, this is actually perfect like

56
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,020
Connection here because I am desperate to talk to you guys about a podcast called Hank the cowdog

57
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,780
Now I don't know this. Okay, good. That's perfect. Actually

58
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,020
So I was listening to blank check. They were talking about

59
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,500
I don't know how they got on to it

60
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
but they started talking about Hank the cowdog and

61
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,660
they had just discovered its existence and then I in turn discovered it through their discovery and

62
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,820
I just want to tell you guys about Hank the cowdog. Okay, cool

63
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,060
Okay, the self is it funny or is this like are we getting really pop culture happy? I want to talk to you about the cast

64
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,700
Okay, okay. Does it include a dog it stars Matthew McConaughey as Hank the cowdog

65
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,300
Okay, good start good start, right? It also include it's written and directed by Jeff Nichols

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,720
And executive producer by Jeff Nichols

67
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,100
Is Hank who also McConaughey served an executive producer Justin I hate to stop you real quick

68
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
But I think there's been some confusion

69
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,060
um

70
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,880
You said podcast but clearly this can't be a podcast because it like has won a celebrity in it

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
And then till you said it's written

72
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,420
And directly, I think you're not actually supposed to write them

73
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,260
I think you're talking about like a movie or maybe a TV show or like a radio drama

74
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,540
Okay, so Jeff Nichols did direct Matthew McConaughey in mood the movie

75
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,180
Correct, and now they're working together again with Matthew McConaughey as Hank a spiritual successor to mud

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
I haven't seen it but dogs love mud

77
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:46,660
Jesse Plemons as drover. Okay, sure Kirsten Dunst as Sally May John R. Erickson as Wallace the buzzard

78
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,820
Michael Shannon as sinister the bobcat Joel Edgerton as rip and

79
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,700
Snort and then you got Leslie

80
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,600
Jordan and Cynthia Riva bringing up the back of this this this

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Incredible cast this incredible cast of United for Hank the cowdog a five episode

82
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,000
Event now if you were to tell me when this series was released

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,580
I bet with a little bit of thinking you could carbon date it to almost a month. Can I guess? Yeah

84
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm going to say

85
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,400
June

86
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,480
2020

87
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
Wow

88
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Travis Wow

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
August of 2020

90
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,480
Little bit in post there had a little bit of post work to do to make Michael Shannon really sound like sinister

91
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
You know everyone I was trying

92
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Stop, it does not take much work to make Michael. So I met Michael Shannon for eight seconds at a restaurant

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Did you really yeah?

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,720
I pissed my pants and somehow he pissed Michael Shannon's pants. It was amazing

95
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,200
I thought he didn't have any food yet

96
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,880
And so I bet he won't mind if I go say hey to Michael Shannon

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,960
So I walked up and he looked up at me like we're eating

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,200
What are you eating no, he didn't really say that what a pleasure it is to meet you Griffin, yeah

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,260
I'm a Hollywood big shot Michael Shannon now, if you'll excuse me, I'm learning my lines for a bobcat role

100
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm playing sinister

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
It's the role of a lifetime

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,960
Nothing else is happening. No, not Justin. I'm sorry. I hate this was years before

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,160
He played saying he was just preparing for a bobcat role knowing it would walk. He was manifesting

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm gonna be a bobcat

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,760
It's not really what he sounds like. It's weird. They didn't come back to this one after the sort of pandemic

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,900
Restrictions were lifted for Hollywood types

107
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,860
Yeah, not a lot of return. I think they just made those five and then kind of

108
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,980
Did it? Well, but podcasting is hard man. Not everybody can put out 600 some episodes

109
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,800
You know what I mean? Like a lot of quitters out there

110
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,260
Apparently it's funny you say that draft

111
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,700
apparently according to an email or received I

112
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,940
Said in episode like 12 or 13 that this would be the final episode

113
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
This one

114
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,060
Recording right now six, whatever. I mean what we should have prepared more. I don't I don't think of it. I

115
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,180
Don't think of it as episodes anymore. No, no, it's a conversation. Oh

116
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,620
It's jazz I regret to inform everyone

117
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
It's jazz. It's jazz

118
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
You've been listening to jazz this whole time

119
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,900
Yes, I've been hearing jazz and it's not the kind of jazz you're enjoying dad likes. Okay

120
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Sorry. Yeah, I got ahead of the

121
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,220
thing

122
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,100
That happens sometimes when we're just when we're just jazzin. Oh, she's just sitting behind my monitor

123
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,660
What a cute little kitty cat. You little stinker. I bet it's warm back there

124
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,500
Should we do advice? Yeah, let's do advice

125
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm in the process of moving and I have no chairs to sit on and I eat in my place now and eat it

126
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,300
No place to sit. I got my clauses have weird emphasis like kitty clauses

127
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm in the process of moving and I have no chairs to sit on and eat in my place

128
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay, I have no chairs to sit on a knee in my place. Now. There we go

129
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,460
I ordered pizza for me and my roommates

130
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,580
That's nice. And then they left to get drinks while I waited now. The delivery driver has given me the large 24-inch

131
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,740
Oh, that's large. That's a big you gotta turn that sideways door feet of saw

132
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,300
That's one foot shy of a Bigfoot. Well, you know, it's a two-feet. It's a two-feet

133
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,900
Diameter, but I'm sure if we could do a little bit of pi r-squared calculation we can figure out

134
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,940
What the what the actual area of the pizza is but yes possible actually you cannot figure out the area of a circle

135
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,340
Ah, damn doesn't matter. I tried if people tried

136
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,940
But that's not the important thing the important thing is the only place to put it and eat is

137
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
On the ground in the living room

138
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,860
You don't get some counters. What you don't got kitchen counters

139
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,300
Now the only place to put it and eat is on the ground in the living room

140
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,380
The living room has a huge window

141
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,700
Which he can clearly see me from the driver the driver and he has been sitting

142
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,340
In his car for about three minutes, and I've just been standing with the pizza behind a column

143
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,180
So you won't see me sitting on the floor. That's good

144
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
You're doing good alone

145
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
You're doing is

146
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,540
Exemplary is this a ridiculous? Should I care this much or just do it? I'm so very hungry again

147
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,740
This is a large and they they have a little calves here a large

148
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,420
24 inch pizza that's from I do think that's important

149
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,020
That is important that it's a lot because if the driver rolls up you're in what sounds like an empty apartment

150
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,900
Like empty bear and it's just you and you ordered a large 24

151
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,060
There is is I'm just gonna say a slightly disturbing imagery that I'm getting for the driver

152
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
You need to set up a sort of home alone

153
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
shadow play

154
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,500
Situation on the curtains and blinds. I mean you don't have furniture in your house

155
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,320
So I'm gonna assume you don't have a big inflatable clown and a talk boy. You know what happens when you assume

156
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,140
Thank you, I want to say 24-inch is pretty big. Yes. There was a place. I used a Mediterranean place

157
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,940
I got pizza from in Austin and it's called arpeggio grill and they had what they called the giant

158
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,300
30 inch pizza that they had to slice so I think we had some of that when you boys were in town from my

159
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,220
Minor Rachel's wedding correct and it's such a big pizza and they have to have slices

160
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,060
Really thin and it looks like a clown's necktie and they had they had to use slightly angle it to get it through your front

161
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,620
Door if I remember. Yeah, and in my in the trunk of my

162
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:19,100
Toyota matrix anyway, I think it's speaking of some you boys can see behind me. I have nothing

163
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,660
Yeah, that is a the rules are suspended when you have just moved in a way that you would be

164
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,800
It would be a shame for you to waste that opportunity

165
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,940
This is the time where it's okay for you to sit on floor and eat pizza

166
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,340
Some of my most special memories in the last house that I lived in was just sitting on the floor with my with my fam

167
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,500
My buds. Yeah, and just gobbling down some Pete Harry's burgers on the ground on the ground

168
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,300
It's special because you're connected to the root of it where the where the burger came from

169
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
You know how much you'll appreciate

170
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,080
Having table and chair. Oh, I have also used to sit on the floor. You'll say I

171
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,220
Was a delivery driver for Jimmy John's for a while, which I'm sure I've talked about

172
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,820
The driver does not care three minutes feels like a long time, but let me tell you a little secret

173
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:16,780
He's just for him. That's three minutes where he's not at work. That's all he's thinking about baby

174
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Is that three minutes appeared from his?

175
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:26,940
The moment that door shuts because there's no way that this is the first time a pizza delivery driver has delivered to someone moving into an

176
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,100
Apartment as Griffin has said it's such a common connection of like help me move. I order pizza. I'll just say it to

177
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,460
Three minutes. Maybe that guy should roll on out

178
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:43,620
You know see he should roll on out. Maybe three minutes isn't that long three minutes is a lot

179
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,900
imagine someone pulling up outside your house and

180
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,640
There yeah, you notice it that car honey that car's been there for three minutes

181
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,860
That's a weird amount of time to idle outside someone's home. Okay. All right. Here's what I'll give you you are correct

182
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,100
I've never been a pizza delivery driver. Maybe he was like

183
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,220
Noting it in his logbook or something depending on which side of the equation

184
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,860
You're on three minutes is a long time if you're in the house looking out

185
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,180
Three minutes is a long time that they're sitting there

186
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,340
If you're the driver and your friend sends you a great long-form tick-tock and you're like wow watch this for you at the road

187
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,540
I want to be responsible and not watch tick tocks while I drive and they don't let me watch it

188
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,180
Then three minutes is nothing, right?

189
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,140
But I guess that's about how long it takes to pack a bowl of that green stuff, which I bet. Oh, I said not to cat

190
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,940
I had a dilemma yesterday

191
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,020
I want to bounce it off the two of you speaking of cars being in places where they shouldn't be for a long time

192
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,580
Lightning McQueen shut up wanted to fight you. He wanted to fight me for the love of my wife. Whoa, not again

193
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,460
Someone left a car in our driveway in the morning and at first I was like, oh, that's weird

194
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,100
Someone parked in our driveway like who who does that? So one it's a one-spot DC driveways

195
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,020
That we and we don't have permits to park on the street is very inconvenient

196
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,260
And so I was like, I bet they'll move it a couple hours later still there. I was like, that's weird

197
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,380
Anyway, I'm gonna check the mail open up the mailbox the keys to the car were in the mailbox

198
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Why someone had someone had delivered an automobile into my possession?

199
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,740
Incorrectly, and there was no information on whose actual car it was

200
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,960
Where I belong how to get how to how to do it how to how to do the thing

201
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,460
Push it in the street street and just leave it all the police

202
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,860
I had to move it so that I could park in our driveway so we wouldn't get a ticket

203
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,660
You got into this and listen, so I got in you got your fingerprints

204
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,380
Let's go it is stole a car. Yeah, did do a grand theft auto for like so you fell for the bait car

205
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,620
You got your fingerprints all over it. Yes

206
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,980
Griffin my innocent boy my young my young

207
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,700
naive

208
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,060
gentlemen your assumption that someone incorrectly delivered that car and not dropped like

209
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,020
What could be a like murder clue into your driveway?

210
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:15,500
And they're like, this is Griffin's problem now. Yeah, and and then what did you do? Oh

211
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I I moved it out into the street and I left it there for a while and still nobody came to get it

212
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,940
So I went door-to-door and fortunately like on the third house I went to

213
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,520
But those first two houses you didn't drive it, right? I I did have to say I was like, yeah

214
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,960
So it's nice to meet you. Yeah, we're just across the street. I drove your car. So we'll see

215
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,160
No, it's Christine. You can't drive it

216
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,060
Yeah

217
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,500
Hey, can I do can I do a wizard? Oh, I'd love that Griff. I'd love yeah do a wizard on us

218
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,180
Stefan sent this in it's how to not get creeped out by a chain letter

219
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,060
Oh cool from school or work you take off your shoes turn on the TV and check your email you look around and see a message

220
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,900
You read it and you realize it's a piece of chain mail with a threat. Wait, hold on

221
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,420
Can I jump back real quick the series of events there turn on your TV and check your email?

222
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,620
There's a disconnect there and then you look around and see a message like what?

223
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:24,140
Where's the information coming from in this scenario the TV the air around you? Yeah, I'm scared shitless right now

224
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,220
So if we could just power through this if you don't forward it to ten people, you'll get a frightening consequence

225
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,580
What do you do what to do this how to explains how to deal with this also works on comments such as sites as YouTube

226
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,300
Okay. Yeah, sometimes I am just trying to you know ASMR myself

227
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,100
into the sweet oblivion of sleep and I'll be scrolling through and it's like if you don't

228
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,460
like this comment 69 times then

229
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,020
Your dad is gonna fall is gonna gravity will reverse for him. Yeah, I'll know you've seen these letters

230
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,060
This is why I hate to spoil it but I assume this comes up

231
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:07,380
This is why whenever I go to a place like Bed Bath and Beyond or like a Yankee Candle and they're like

232
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,540
Do you want to sign up for like our email newsletter? I say yes

233
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,540
and then I when they email me I write down that email address and I just keep ten of those right next to me ready to

234
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,740
Go shotgun. So awesome. So when you get one, that's like your gravity gravity's gonna reverse

235
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,940
Yeah, dad, he'll fall up into space. If you don't send this to ten people you'd be like, what's up?

236
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,740
Bed Bath Beyond what's up Yankee Candle? All I'm saying is I heard circuit city didn't forward it to ten people

237
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,980
Look at him now

238
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,420
Yeah, did you guys um, do you all when you're at the the store and you're checking out?

239
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,980
They're like, um, just need your email address and your phone number. Have you guys ever made up fake ones to avoid?

240
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,220
Having to say I'd rather not give you my email address

241
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
Absolutely. I have no I'm

242
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,080
Devin's not getting paid enough. You don't think Devon you don't think Devon would like that too

243
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,380
No, not I'm the eighth person to say been stinky cheeks at Gumi on that biz that day

244
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,100
He g69 we could not secure stinky cheeks at goo mail. Yeah

245
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,060
Well, I had to put an underscore and just to be quick real quick. Yeah, you guys think

246
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:19,020
Yes, think goo mail.biz is available right for sure, right? Hey, so yeah. Yeah, that's gonna hurt our brand

247
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,420
I think in the long run you think goo mail.biz

248
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,340
I don't think so juice snatched that up for me. I'll pay you back. Sometimes the without biz can get a little pricey

249
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Let's see how this is doing

250
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,840
goo mail

251
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,380
Good goo mail.biz is taken. I knew it

252
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Fucking

253
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
Listening in I could goo mail.me

254
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,420
That means you mail me bro, dude

255
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,900
Shoot me a goo mail. We got goo mail goo mail.fun

256
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,460
Goo mail.me it was it we found it. It's good work. Hello. Oh, you're male at or

257
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
We're a regular

258
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,300
Nonprofit, we need to sell goo mail.com or just gift it to our favorite nonprofit and be like, this is this is for you

259
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,740
No, this is yours now. Okay, so let's get into the article

260
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm not buying any goo mails if I can't get goo mail.biz. It's like not it's now what about all goo mail.com

261
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
get goo mail.com

262
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,980
Get goo mail

263
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,300
Okay. Okay. What it think? What is the chain mail? Is it bbq at my house?

264
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,500
I won't like it if you don't come if it is you're fine

265
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,040
It's not really an alarming thing just a friend who expects you to show up and might be sore at you if you don't if not

266
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,940
Continue on I would say that's an alarming thing. Yeah, someone sent me a message like hey grilling up some some sweet beefy boys

267
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,220
And my house, I won't like it if you don't come

268
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,740
Also, that's not really sorry article a chain real that's called an invitation

269
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:57,580
If someone is chain mailing invitation says invite ten other people to this. Yeah, that's wild. That's lazy. Also

270
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,740
Don't get drawn into reading it

271
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,580
Usually at the top there is something such as don't read this or stop if there is you should stop and delete it

272
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:12,460
Good advice in general chain letters often tell you to read or don't read as a ploy playing on your initial curiosity

273
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,500
So you read them they'll eventually hit you with a bunch of bologna designed to push your panic button or use any other emotion you have

274
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Against you for one purpose only to get you spreading it further

275
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,180
So I guess if you get email and it's like read this or don't read this then do the opposite

276
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,720
But here's the problem. I get a lot of emails from my doctor with important like test results

277
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,060
I go like once a week just to get random tests, whatever they got. Yeah, they'll use

278
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,500
Travis here any new tests today? Yeah, we got three new ones. Which one do you want surprise me?

279
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,060
I

280
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,900
Was just this is something I want to talk about. Okay me characters welcome. Yeah, we're doing a scene

281
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,380
Okay, that was a scene of vignette. That was a skit a skit. I want us to get better about skits

282
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,980
Fault to I'm gonna play everybody in my skit and I feel like it's good there

283
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,900
I've been meaning to talk to you guys about this when we're not recording but like this. Yeah. Yeah now do it here

284
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,300
Yeah, this is don't double up on the skit. Let other people have fun with the skin with you, right? Okay

285
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,420
Yeah, you want to try it again? Okay

286
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Fucking whiskey. Yeah

287
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,020
Sorry, honey. Daddy's trying to whistle. I'm sorry that your daddy's a bad whistler

288
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,860
Travis here any new tests today? I've got a gun

289
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I've got a sword gun

290
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,180
Yeah, you win

291
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
No, I don't want to be in this kit. Oh

292
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Hey, who's that at your door?

293
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,900
This is my little brother Griffin. He's recording a podcast with me. Hey, what's up?

294
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,100
Yeah, look out he's got a slur gun and he loves tests

295
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,500
This is the this is one of the worst kits we've ever done if I if I may we should stick to one person

296
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:13,740
So if you get an email that says oh like don't read this or stop then don't read it and do stop

297
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,800
Stay rational and sensible often the email or comment will be some story commonly about some monster or a fictional dead kid attacking people

298
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,700
Don't lose your head and get scared. There's no such thing as monsters Wow or

299
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,020
Dead kids attacking people you've known that since you were small

300
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,860
No chain letter is gonna cause what to want to blip into existence to kill you or anyone else

301
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,260
You know dead people are dead and can't go around attacking you pulling you down

302
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,420
It's some non-existent well or do any of those things

303
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,220
Your dad's ex-boyfriend Daryl is it going to come back to your house? I don't know shit about shit

304
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,060
First of all, I know that up till now that hasn't happened. But also up till now

305
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,180
I've always forwarded every chain letter I've ever got correct. So we've got a chain of chain letters

306
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,300
You don't want to break that chain. Yeah, nice try

307
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,460
Never break the chain

308
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,700
Victorian skeleton boy, but you will never get me to go in that well cuz you're not real

309
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,140
You're not real and the wells not real either. But if it is I did forward the chain letter, so I have nothing

310
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,140
I'm doubled down. Yeah

311
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,060
Understand it's hard when you're a Victorian skeleton boy and you just have like a really cool rock collection inside a well

312
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,460
And you're like come check out these rocks and they're like no, you know, like I'm not I just want it

313
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:34,020
Oh, you can't have a house when you're a Victorian skeleton in this economy in this economy, especially not

314
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,260
The consequences of not following along with the chain communication do not exist after you read the story

315
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,140
It will say something like if you do not send this to ten people you will die in two days

316
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
I assume through some sort of

317
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Victorian well boy

318
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,420
Think will this happen to you will you actually die because you didn't send an email

319
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,540
How is it even possible a made-up story and text and pixels created by some anonymous hoaxer can actually kill you

320
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,700
Well, I don't know. I know if I knew that then I would be the one sending right Gary murder

321
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,580
You can't say you can't say will it happen because there's a whole point is I don't know

322
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Right. I don't know the future. I

323
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,580
don't understand the

324
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,340
What the author of the scary Victorian skeleton boy chain letter email gets out of it unless they're like

325
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,260
Send this to ten people and also here's a link to my bank amp. Yeah, I've got a new I've got this

326
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,100

327
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,980
Oh the hot new sound will also keep the scary Victorian skeleton. Well boy. Oh, yes

328
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,980

00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:43,020
Subscribe to smash that like button forward it to ten friends or the skeleton boy is gonna well you really hard

330
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,260
I wish I could be there when this person finds this article like okay Valerie calm down. It's okay

331
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,420
It's just a chain letter. We're gonna get through this

332
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,500
Yeah, just go to Yahoo. Let's go. Yeah

333
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,620
No, this step is fucks me up step five

334
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,700
Don't send it to anyone else doing this stops other people from getting it and passing it on and getting worse

335
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Okay, so you do want me to be?

336
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,200
Drowned in a well, which is which is which is which of the two things is it?

337
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Cuz you're telling me not to be scared of the chain email and in my personal experience

338
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,880
That means giving in to the demands of the chain

339
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,960
I figured it out. I'm gonna solve this whole thing. I'm gonna fix fix chain letters for good

340
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,920
What it's gonna take is 12 brave souls, right? And then it's gonna be a full-time job

341
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,920
But every time you get a chain letter

342
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,720
You're gonna forward it to these same 12 people right and then they're gonna forward it to each other and just as chain letters come

343
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,200
In we're just gonna keep sending it to these same 12 people until eventually we've created

344
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:49,100
Like an echo chamber for every chain letter until it's just these 12 people bouncing it back and forth to each other

345
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,140
It should be 13

346
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,620
I guess because you need one to send it to 12 others, right?

347
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,500
Right, and we're just gonna bounce it around and contain the energy now god forbid when one of them kicks it. Oh

348
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,160
Boy, this is going to become like a Knights of the Round Table

349
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,980
Thing of like you're gonna have to find somebody to take over but I'm gonna love this, you know, we call it

350
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:14,460
What the unbroken chain and it's a group of people that just keep passing around they protect all of us

351
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,720
Yes, you know a chain letter toilet that you just flush

352
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,540
That is also the secret society from adventures on graduation, but that's fine. No, but that's how they got started, right?

353
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:31,060
Oh, okay, great. Great equal. This is a prequel to our pretend podcast. Yeah is different from this podcast

354
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:37,860
Our very real podcast this one gets fun. Keep the email even if it is absolutely creepy

355
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,720
Keep the email and smash it

356
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,740
Write out all the things wrong with it and make yourself laugh at the utter

357
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,700
Ridiculousness of the story and the threat attached to keeping the message is a good way of stopping a troublesome emailer

358
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,100
You tell someone teacher parent friend don't tell someone

359
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:58,520
Tell someone teacher parent friend, etc. You have proof of getting this unwanted email teacher teacher check this out, please

360
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,240
I'm going to show this to you. I'm not going to forward it to you. So the curse will not be

361
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,160
activated, but I need you to know that I have been threatened with a well boy and

362
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,920
I think about it, I guess we're getting into semantics though, right?

363
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Because yeah, you're not mechanically forwarding electronically forwarding it

364
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,080
But you are like moving the information in the brain. The digital data is how the curse is transmitted

365
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,840
Okay, see I've never seen the ring for obvious reasons

366
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,760
But I do know that in stories like the ring like there's always that moment of like you heard about it

367
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,640
Check this out. There's no way right and like that idea of I like this thing of don't take it seriously

368
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,200
But don't not take it seriously like just could say at least let the buck stop with you

369
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
So that's how to not get creeped out by a chain letter

370
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,860
Confront the sender if the person sends you three or more emails tell someone else you've already told the teacher I guess get

371
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,480
multiple

372
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,640
Just sort of hands. Yeah, tell someone out first you tell the teacher and then the vice principal and then the principal

373
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,220
That's the chain of command. It doesn't go any that's why it's called the chain letter. Yeah

374
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah, you pass that on up the chain to your principal. Yeah. Oh, no

375
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:21,840
Your vice principal don't take that. Don't hey get this off my desk. I'm the principal of a major middle school

376
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,800
I don't have time for chain letters. Take this to the associate vice-principal

377
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm going to have to talk to the superintendent about the letters to me and then I give them to President Joseph Biden

378
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,440
And he for it guys to our nation's greatest enemies and then the well boy hunts down terrorists

379
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,960
I knew from Amazon Prime. Well boy

380
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, well boy, you're a last hope

381
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
sending this to Kim Jong

382
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,160
Kim Jong-un well boy you and Dennis Rodman are gonna work together on this

383
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,100
I'm not working with Roman no more. I can't trust him push him in the wheel

384
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,000
Get me Jack. That was Dennis Rodman's voice

385
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,240
Oh by the way, yeah, well boy sounds like this. Yeah, well boy has seen some shit

386
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,440
Boy's been in a well or two. I don't think you get to be a Victorian well boy skeleton

387
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Trial without being a little bit jaded

388
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,680
Well, I've seen a lot the inside of a lot of wells pal. Once you've once you've pushed

389
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Non-forwarding strangers into a well or two. We'll talk about it

390
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,740
Oh changes yeah changes you're being down in a well for so long. Hey, can we try to do?

391
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Hear about this Jessica

392
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,960
Baby, just tell my whole yeah. Well boy. I'm sure you bring that one up a lot. Well boy

393
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:53,360
There's not a lot of famous well characters. I just finished the job and it's my fault. Oh, no, she had sinned

394
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:02,060
Oh Jesus well boy. Yeah, baby Jessica was a creature of sin and I was trying doing my best like that one part the leftovers

395
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,640
She ended up. Okay, though, right? I don't want to talk about it. Okay adorable and evil

396
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,080
She'll forward every fucking letter. She receives this kid. This is for

397
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,560
Menards flyers that she gets just to be just to be extra careful

398
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,440
Careful, she's not going back to that. Well, that's what I live for. That's why I'm in this business, brother

399
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,680
If I'm gonna give up well for you or anybody

400
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,920
I might try a sister in her to just to see how it goes

401
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,920
Watch the video of macho man Randy Savage on Arsenio Hall and our cinema halls like does the macho man ever cry?

402
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:48,640
He's like, oh, yeah, brother the macho man experiences the entire range of emotion. Yes

Fuck man. Fuck. Yeah, dude

So told everyone that she knew about Squarespace and God sent her like a grip of cash

428
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:53,700
My smallest friend Dwayne was feeling real puny and he used those days and now he's the rock

429
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,940
Whoa, turn into the rock. Yeah. Yeah overnight

It's always this young boy rock and then big man rock

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:13,700
Yeah, there wasn't a teen rock because he did he's forwarded on this incredible chain advertisement for Squarespace

437
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,500
My dingle donger got huge and I got a thousand. I got a hundred dollars. Whoa

438
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,980
In the mail from who I don't know. I don't know. It was an empty. It was an envelope with nothing on it

439
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,500
That was actually from me. I wanted you to invest that I

440
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,460
Got a letter from the Census Bureau. That's like hey, we're doing this thing on a national survey of children's health

441
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,860
Will you fill it out and I was like, uh, I guess so and I looked further in the letter. There's a $5 bill

442
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,700
Inside of it, you know, they were doing that. Thanks census

443
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,060
Buy myself a three musketeers. What were we doing?

00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,660
That this we're having a really fun time. Yeah, absolutely

448
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,940
It's clear, but it's a but these are not these are jokes in Squarespace

449
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,700
I think would be pretty pio'd if we didn't

450
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:34,660
Say that like when we said that all of your bones would revolt and leave your body if you don't tell everyone you know

About this episode of the podcast in Squarespace, then you put something bad will happen to your bones or God will make your business rich

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
That probably won't happen

453
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:52,700
Legally, we have to say that here at the end. Yeah, but it definitely will but wink

454
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,780
Hi everyone, I'm Anna McLeod

455
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,580
And I'm Alexis B Preston and we host a show called comfort creatures the show for every animal lover

456
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,840
Be it a creature of scales six legs fur feathers or fiction

457
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,460
Comfort creatures is a show for people who prefer their friends to have paws instead of hands unless they are raccoon hands

458
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,260
That is okay. That is absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Yes, every Thursday

459
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,180
We will be talking to guests about their pets learning about pets in history art and even fiction

460
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,940
Plus we'll discover differences between pet ownership across the pond. It's gonna be a hoot on maximum fun

461
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,540
Hi everybody, my name is Justin McElroy and I'm Sydney McElroy doctor

462
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,340
That is true. It's important in this context because we host a medical history podcast called

463
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:48,180
Sawbones. Oh, I thought we were gonna we shouldn't work on that. Sawbones. Sawbones isn't afraid to ask the hard-hitting questions

464
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,860
Like are vaccines as safe and reliable as they want us to believe? Yes. Do I have to get a flu shot?

465
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,420
Yes

466
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
Okay, is science a miracle?

467
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
No

468
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:07,320
We have a lot of great history for you and a lot of laughs and sometimes the history is so bad that there's no laughs

469
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,800
But you'll learn something you'll feel something and it's always sawbones. That's right

470
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
every week on maximumfun.org

471
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,800
Okay, you're your middle name is macho

472
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,960
But uh, I'm wondering if you ever cry you ever has macho man ever cried. Oh, yeah

473
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,280
It's okay for macho men to show every emotion available right there, you know, because I've cried a thousand times

474
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I'm gonna cry some more but

475
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,680
I've soared with the Eagles and I've slithered with the snakes and I've been everywhere in between

476
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,080
And I'm gonna tell you something right now. There's one guarantee in life and that there are no guarantees. Yeah

477
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,320
Nobody likes a quitter nobody said life was easy

478
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,420
So if you get knocked down take the standing eight count get back up and fight again, and you're a macho maniac

479
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,980
Dig it. There it is. Fuck. I mean, yeah, there it is from the macho man himself

480
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:13,320
Do you remember when macho man body slam toxic masculinity? Yeah, thank you much. Fuck. Yeah, dude

481
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,600
Remember when all Hogan ever body slam was fucking Richard Belzer. Yeah

482
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:28,160
All I'm saying is macho man press freedom those two things were body slammed by Hulk Hogan

483
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,900
We've never fully discussed as a society. I think macho man Randy Savage's ability to

484
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:40,220
Use the two-word phrase. Oh, yeah in so many different ways. Just that like

485
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,460
It's an interrogative it was fucking poetry when he said I love that. Oh, yeah

486
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:57,540
Yeah, macho man's cried. Yeah much and it's it can be more passive than that macho man. Do you want some blackberry cobbler? Oh, oh, yeah

487
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:07,380
That when macho man cries the tears don't drip down his face they like come out, okay, they like Gleek

488
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,740
Brother the blast like tear juice

489
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,060
It's very macho. Um, I train and teach at a local Krav Maga gym. Ah

490
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,660
The beautiful dance the art sweet science recently

491
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,720
We had a 78 year old man join our gym and started attending classes and he beat everyone to death. No

492
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,620
Miss read I miss read

493
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,840
He's just told came to one of my classes but ended up leaving after about 20 minutes gotten all he needed to I guess

494
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,920
Just wanted to learn how to punch his mailman in the face and now he's ready to go

495
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,860
No, I don't think that's it. Um the next day at another instructors class. He came up to me and said I

496
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,660
Wrote a poem about your class yesterday. Do you want to see I said, okay

497
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,740
Then he went out to his car, but instead of getting the poem he drove away

498
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,140
We have seen one another at the gym multiple times since then but neither of us have mentioned this poem

499
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,500
Brothers, how can I unlock the old man?

500
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,140
Krav Maga poem that's from Troubled in Tennessee. This can't be

501
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,100
This can't be real, right? I mean this can't be real

502
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,580
Well, you know in I so I I build a question list and in picking this question

503
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:32,500
Not until this moment that the possibility occurred to me that perhaps in in poem form. It's like a performance art thing

504
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:39,100
It was a poem. He wrote it's a performance poem. Thank you. Yeah, the performance he wrote is the leaving or he was like

505
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,580
Just what's it mean to you? Like I did a performance art piece about right off Maga and here it is

506
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,860
I'd like to do it for you right now

507
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,220
Also, let me just say it was also good to me

508
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,580
If you are ever in this the old man's position here and you start taking a class and you're like, oh

509
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
I don't really want to take this class anymore

510
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:04,660
It's not just walking out loudly announced like oh wait. I already know this. I know this. I'm punching and kicking. I can do that. Oh Krav Maga. Okay, I'm sorry

511
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:11,260
I've called it something else. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no I know this. I got it confuses with quilting. Do you think do you think?

512
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
Do you think there's a possibility?

513
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:24,180
That this old man thought he was going to a class for people that crave Maga

514
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
Is it possible?

515
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,180
This man is like hell yeah

516
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,180
Hell yeah

517
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
If that's the case he made it 20 minutes

518
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,180
So there's like it's coming. It's good. Yeah, okay. He's trying to hang in there like yeah this too

519
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:46,180
I guess yeah, also this all right. Yeah, I don't think they're gonna get to it. I don't think it's maybe maybe that's a second class

520
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,180
They don't want to let you they don't give it away for free if you're really craving the Maga. Sorry, I misread it

521
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
I was craving manga. Sorry. I gotta go

522
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,180
You guys have any any rare one-piece in your collection

523
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,180
You guys have any any rare one-piece issues

524
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:14,180
I like how you read them backwards

525
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:22,180
Is it if anyone ever comes up to you and says I have written a poem and then the active verb that they use in the next sentences

526
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Do you want to see it?

527
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,180
That feels weird to me instead of do you want to read it or do you want me to read it to you?

528
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:36,180
If they go I wrote a poem do you want to see it and then they try to take you to a second location where the poem lives

529
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:43,180
No, do you think that's what's happening Griffin like the old man went out to his car and then was like surprised like they didn't follow me

530
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Huh, I thought I just assumed they'd come with the poems at home

531
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:53,180
The poems at home is interesting like if he thought it was in the car, and he's like I'm gonna get that fucking poem

532
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:59,180
And then he goes out it's like the poems not here and he's like I should go back in and tell him oh, but I'm so embarrassed

533
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,180
That's happened to me with my wallet at a store

534
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,180
I'll just go in and recite as much as I remember no David god damn don't it's so embarrassing

535
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:14,180
That has happened to me at like a grocery store or something like where I've bought all the groceries up to the front and realized it in my wallet

536
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,180
I said I must have left it out of the car I go out in the car the wallets not there and then there's the question of like

537
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,180
I'm not gonna go back in and say so I drive home. Do I get my wallet?

538
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Do I just say like well, let's scrap it for the day, right? He had a good run didn't quite get there. It happened. This is

539
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,180
This is for me a non-issue. Oh

540
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,180
Because if someone ever came up to me and said I have a poem I wrote about something you did and now I'm gonna do it

541
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,180
To you right now and you you can't oh, it's in the car and then they leave and don't come back

542
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I have just avoided a social interaction that would have

543
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,180
Shaved years off of my life. Yeah, that would be a tricky needle to thread unless it's really good

544
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:05,180
Unless you think this 20-minute 20-minute observed Krav Maga poem is gonna is on some real Robert Frost shit

545
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:11,180
What I'm saying is that perhaps the reason that he left your class early is because inspiration struck him

546
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:19,180
So hard that he had to grasp the reins and hold on tight and it was not up to him when he pursued the muse

547
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:25,180
but rather the muse pursued him and he had to like follow and write it and and like

548
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,180
It just moved him so much that he had to go write this poem

549
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,180
But he did say he had already written it. Yes. Well, this is our following day

550
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:41,180
Yeah, but then he went home and he was like they're not ready for this if I give him this poem

551
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,180
It'll change the way that they think about Krav Maga and they're not ready for that

552
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:51,180
This is a bank error in your favor done very well. You have broken this you've you've somehow bugged out

553
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,180
This NPC interaction that was going to make you very uncomfortable. Yes, and that's dope

554
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:05,180
I would love the sweet cheat codes that you are rocking my friend so that I can avoid any other stranger poem

555
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,180
Sort of moments that may happen to me in my lifetime

556
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,180
I don't know when that would be perhaps when I'm strolling the streets of Paris at nighttime

557
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:21,180
With with my lady love and some bohemian type comes up to me at the riverside

558
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:28,180
And you know, it's like give me five dollars. You know how they do how they do it

559
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:34,180
You know how the bohemian types are always doing that for five dollars in Paris where they want US currency

560
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:41,180
This is this is a fundamental difference between Gryphon and I of in Cincinnati

561
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,180
A gentleman has approached me and said for five dollars. I'll do a poem on you. No lie

562
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:51,180
I said yes, of course. I handed him five dollars now. I do not remember the poem but I remember enjoying it thoroughly and saying

563
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Thank you very much and tipping him an extra five dollars because it was such a wonderful poem and I went on about my day feeling inspired

564
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,180
Well, I mean on the day where I told the poem man that I didn't want the poem

565
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,180
I went on to do a bunch of other really good stuff. Oh

566
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:12,180
Like what so well, you know, I helped I bought some apples for the school. Yeah like

567
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,180
Yes, what Apple computers? No

568
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:23,180
Just like the eaten kind enough for everybody. Yeah enough for the whole school. I bought apples for them all

569
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,180
Well, that's a lot of that's a lot of apples dude cost me so much money

570
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,180
And then I did I went to the hospital and helped it like fixed a couple people

571
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,180
Well, you know what? I heard driven a lot of those people ended up in the hospital because someone had bought all the apples and they were having

572
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,180
Apple deficiencies and it made them really sick so they had to go to the hospital

573
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,180
well, you know do something nice for someone and

574
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:52,180
Yeah, and also I heard given that the people you did fix were serial killers what yeah

575
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,180
Okay, but I did other good stuff that day like what day where I said no to the poem man

576
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,180
Yeah, like what the serial killers and stole all the apples from the rest of the world and gave it to one school

577
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:08,180
Yeah, which honestly now that I'm thinking back about it was probably good on apples, but I was just feeling really guilty about the poem guy

578
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Yeah, what else did you do that day Griffin? Oh, I bought season

579
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,980
Three of lost. Oh, that was really kind of you. Yeah, and I gave it to the library. Oh

580
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,060
To the library and I was like give these out to kids who want to go on this like

581
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:31,180
mysterious adventure now with everyone was that the season three box out that was discontinued because it

582
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,820
Spontaneously would combust and like catch fire to whatever building it was in

583
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,500
This is how is a DVD gonna come that's doesn't make you sense

584
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:43,460
The other stuff we've been saying has been like funny, but like yeah, yeah, like make you think

585
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,180
That's what I like when it like you kind of hmm

586
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,860
Yeah, like when I was like I bought all the apples and you're like

587
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,900
But then there's no apples for other people that's real and that make you think but when you're like the lost DVDs burn up and burn

588
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,940
Your house down that does not make me

589
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,100
How did a DVD you knew that Travis? How would a DVD do?

590
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,300
I caught the light and refracted it in such a way that the house burned down. That's never happened ever

591
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:19,020
I want a bunch squad squad. Wow guys. Can you give me a little bit fucking more than that?

592
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,620
Please you made a squishy noise in the middle Justin

593
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,940
Just a little bit more than that, please. I don't want to scare the kitty

594
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,340

596
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,820
I'm loving the beer

597
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:42,200
But I feel like when you start to bust out butt rock riffs on it it goes it turns on me

598
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,580
Just a little just a little I don't know why okay. I'm a challenging man now

599
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:50,620
I'm aesthetically more challenging than I was before it takes a refined palette, but those that are into it they get it

600
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
You know I mean they get it Ray J

601
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,620
What did he do?

602
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:00,140
Ray J is helping out Krystal getting back to late night

603
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:06,380
Krystal is the original slider of the South. It's the South's version of White Castle. You understand?

604
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,060
I've never heard I've literally never heard of this once in my life

605
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,460
Real quick to spotlight all things because I have another thing I want to

606
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:22,260
Real quick to spotlight all things fun after dark Krystal is partnering with American actor singer and TV personality

607
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,620
Ray J for a series of commercials quote more of our restaurants are staying open later

608
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,100
Striving to meet the Krystal crave as our guests are getting out and enjoying the nightlife

609
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,620
Hey guys having a fun time at the clubs and with the nightlife and everything

610
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,740
hamburgers from

611
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
Weird make you feel super big

612
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,660
The next hot spot for us small hamburgers from AJ

613
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:52,460
It's weird that you would need to do a commercial to advertise keeping your restaurant open late because of high demand

614
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,300
That is an excellent point

615
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,140
The $1.99 Krystal snack is

616
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:06,740
Is a new option there it's valid at participating restaurants, which they always clarify

617
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,180
But like I feel like if a restaurant is not participating

618
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,780
That's a pretty good sign that you're not gonna walk away with that particular way, but no look what and not only that Krystal

619
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,260
You're in charge to make a participate. Why are you giving your restaurants like I don't want to do that deal

620
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,940
Also, I don't think you can just have

621
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,900
Item on the menu that is name of restaurant snack

622
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,660
I think if I ever went to McDonald's and they're like, do you want McDonald's snack?

623
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,980
Especially when the name of the restaurant is another noun like do you want a Krystal snack?

624
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,300
It sounds like a rock golem with it, right? Absolutely with a side of pebbles. What are you talking about?

625
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
Real quick. I just want to mention that Ray J

626
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,140
Actually, this is a quote

627
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,140
Ray J actually reached out to us

628
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,940
Through our head of creative marketing

629
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,860
You guys know the head of creative marketing for Krystal, right?

630
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,860
Two chains

631
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,420
No, it's two chains and he wanted to get involved in spreading the word about Krystal

632
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:15,740
They're building like an MCU of sponsors. He's like, hi, it's Ray J. I'd like to help get the word out about Krystal

633
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:22,580
Not a lot of people know this but two chains got his name because he owns two different things in the restaurant chain Krystals

634
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,380
There's two different restaurants

635
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,700
Oh man, that's got to be a humble pot

636
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:34,100
Two chains one on I-64 and the other one on I-75 stop on by anytime you want to be happy to see you

637
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,380
That's gotta take a little bit of a win at a two chain sales reason. I cannot get this across the finish line on my

638
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,300
Own two chains. I'm I must I must bring him I must assemble the team

639
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,660
I don't have the I don't have the like self-confidence to become three chains

640
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,500
No that point in the beach where there was only two chains. That's when I was carrying you. I'm Ray J

641
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,820
I do want to say not a lot of people know this it's short for Ray Jesus. I

642
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,020
Want to have it don't think so. I want to check in real quick on Carl Laredo

643
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:12,940
My one of my favorite hype men in the biz worried about Carl Wendy's is adding sweet twists to its breakfast menu

644
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,600
That's right. Homestyle French toast sticks. It's happening

645
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:22,620
It's a sweet new taste at when at Wendy's but how did they settle on this?

646
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:30,300
Well, Carl said our homestyle French toast sticks strike a perfect note of nostalgia and bring even more morning flavor to our menu

647
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,900
This time with something sweet from day one

648
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:39,060
We launched our breakfast offering to save fans from the boring and bland morning options that exists some of our competitors. Yep

649
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,820
We've done just that so you get so caught they were like Carl. I

650
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,500
Love when QSR does this they did an interview. They're like Carl how in the fuck man?

651
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,820
This how did you do this and he said we have a couple options and we really honed in on

652
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,660
French toast as a platform. Yeah, I love when he uses that word

653
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,020
The reason being is that there's there's only certain foods at breakfast time that consumers love

654
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:14,080
But are really difficult to actually put together. Yes, but also carry a lot of emotional benefits. Oh fuck

655
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,220
Yeah, so we start this program of focusing on nostalgia

656
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,620
We could have done waffles, but you know, unfortunately waffles

657
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,500
There's so many that are out there and yeah, they're really bad

658
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,600
Carl and and it hearkens back to mom or dad pulling out waffles of the freezer

659
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,460
And there's always freezer burn. Yeah

660
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,740
But I'm just reading it

661
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,020
Carl is a fucking artist. He's like the Gene Shepard

662
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,220
Like of our time the story he's creating I am sucked into this

663
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:57,740
So it hearkens back to mom or dad pulling waffles of the freezer. There's always freezer burn. It wasn't really all that special

664
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:04,580
Pancakes which are honestly just like dry mix and you mix water and then you throw it in a pan

665
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:10,060
Take that fucking pancakes. You're on blast Carl Laredo's coming for you

666
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,940
Bullshit fuck. Yeah, fuck that play. Anyway, this is sort of pan

667
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,460
It lacked a little bit the extra love that's needed French toast

668
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,220
Interested so without research we discovered French toast is one of those things that was super special

669
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:31,780
Hi, I'm a researcher Carl and I've got the report in and turns out French toast is super special

670
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:39,460
You just swirls a beaker around and the fluid turns from blue to purple and he's like it's special

671
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:49,740
The French toast molecule collide with the syrup molecule and we did it the God particle

672
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,340
Smell this beaker. Oh, what is that waffles? That's not no

673
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:02,140
This is conjuring images of freezer burn and just mother and father taking him out of the freezer

674
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,500
It's like my mother and father who I hate

675
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,020
now this

676
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:13,220
Real quick, what's the key differentiating factor of your French toast eggs from the others?

677
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,900
Carl says it took us a year

678
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,700
It took us a year. We went through 18 different whenever they say that

679
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,180
I always wonder is that like six of the same people rolling up to the office every morning?

680
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,140
They're like, well time to make some more fucking Frankie toast

681
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,140
This is Carl Laredo a French fry visionary

682
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:39,020
So yes Justin I'm going to say that this was Carl and maybe a team of five that had to rotate out Carl CMO

683
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,660
He's just a hype man. He's not out there

684
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:46,620
He's not like chef Mike out there like developing recipes like he perhaps you don't remember the fucking poetry that

685
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,020
Carl Laredo laid down about

686
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,260
Wendy's new crispy fries. No, I know he spits words, but he doesn't like fry fries himself

687
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,100
Yeah, you assume

688
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:01,020
It took us a year. We went through 18 different iterations to get this right

689
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,880
So if I could just do a little bit of math

690
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,660
Real quick, if everyone could just be patient. I'm just pulling up my calculator

691
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:17,560
Real quick. Nope. That's my cat. Are you dividing 365 by 18? So if real quick if I divide

692
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,860
365 by

693
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,780
18 I get

694
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,780
20 so

695
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:31,540
They would make it for 20 days every 20 days. They're like, no, no, I quit

696
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,140
Do it again

697
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,380
Get me a new batch of French toast of

698
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:44,920
Chefs of chefs you're out. We have to make the French toast just like your mom grandma your dad

699
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,840
Whoever it was that made it in your house talking dog the robot Butler, whatever it is

700
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,720
The

701
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
big French ghost

702
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
The magic oven whatever

703
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:07,140
Well boy, you're sometimes you just wake up at the French toast is there and you live alone and not sure whatever

704
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,160
candelabra

705
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,560
3d printer

706
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,720
Whoever it doesn't matter the French toast tree you grew outside that everyone said would never work

707
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:21,640
But look where you got the void gate in the ceiling. We're getting you get it from doesn't matter

708
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,660
So we went through okay. Hey, so we start with Texas toast

709
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:32,760
It goes through an actual egg and dairy and vanilla sugar mix. It's Royale. It's it's a custard

710
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,160
I'm just reading by the way, if I had this for your eyes. Wow. Okay. Yeah, it's a Royale

711
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,040
It's a custard. We make sure it sits in this Royale for the right amount of time. Notice. He's not saying the right amount

712
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,480
No, it's like that's trade secret

713
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,760
It's got to absorb and then actually go through a griddle process

714
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,960
yeah, because you actually want to get all the caramelization around the French toast to get that

715
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,480
Caramelization color and more importantly

716
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,520
the flavor

717
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,880
Then when we get it to a restaurant

718
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,740
This is just a quick flash fry to get it crispy on the outside and you maintain the custard interior

719
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,840
That's what we want to land on

720
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,800
It took us this long because we didn't want to launch until we got it, right?

721
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,160
Hey, if I could just say Carl fucking great instincts, man. Yeah

722
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,640
You don't want to do a you don't want to do a soft open on this one on some shitty toast

723
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,840
We're at this one's in beta. So just try it and if you don't like it, it's it's fine

724
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,580
We weren't gonna stick with it. Anyway, it's fine. I do want to say it sounds like he did describe how to make French toast

725
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,520
Yes, which I should mention

726
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:44,980
Is not hard to do my friend. It's really not if that's the goal. It's like my mom won't make me French toast anymore

727
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
I'm going to Wendy's

728
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
Sorry, dad

729
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,400
No time for this. Anyway there, you know how your your

730
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,240
Caregiver always cut your French toast into sticks and then parted it in a cardboard sleeve and charge you five dollars

731
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,480
Yeah

732
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,200
The memory the magic is back, but unfortunately the magic is also ended damn

733
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,760
I bet you putting them in the in a frosty. I bet that goes down real. Oh, fuck you magic

734
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,840
I mean of podcasting we've made podcasts. We've had a great time enjoyed each other's company enjoyed your company

735
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,080
Well, you were kind enough to be here with us, but this show has come to an end

736
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Not that it is a show it is a conversation

737
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:29,280
And not that it's come to an end because now we have important details. We need to share with you. Correct Travis. It's a conversation

770
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:33,500
So that's it for the show I love you Griffin, how do we know how long it's been since we've sat down to record

771
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:38,780
What I've been ma'am, it's been forever forever. Yeah. Yeah, maybe this is a good time for us to do like a quick

772
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,660
reboot

773
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:45,700
Refresh of how we end the show and maybe and this is just something I've been kicking around for a while

774
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:50,500
It's not always contingent on me saying a funny thing

775
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,660
Though yeah

776
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,060
For sure and that's great

777
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:05,060
But if we could find a way to have some of the pressure be taken off of me and put on you all for a while

778
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,900
I think that that would be cool Griffin's right Griffin's right

779
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:14,660
So at the end of every episode, I would like Griffin to start suggesting a bit that Travis and I can try

780
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,340
next time and

781
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,340
Then we'll see how it goes

782
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,500
but this still does feel like a lot of pressure on me to generate the

783
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,820
It's like you're asking me to write this one time just this one time. I'm gonna write a skit and then

784
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,980
We'll talk about it in between see if it works and then if that's the one

785
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,380
Okay, no more work from you required if it's not the one you just come up with another one

786
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,260
And certainly that will be the one. Okay, so it's we're at a Jamba Juice. Okay, and

Like a among us imposter and you're trying to do bad things to the juice. Oh great

791
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:03,500
Yeah, but it's up to the audience to try and figure out which one of you is trying to hurt the juice

792
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,940
But we won't tell them so let's actually play that out right now. Oh, we'll try that next week
