1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:44,720
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother made an advice show for the modron era. I'm

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,160
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,840
Here is a list of the septuagenarians I've seen this week. Donald Fagan, David Crosby,

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,440
anyway, here's my kids. Fucking best hype man in the biz.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,480
Hey, I'm gonna get the crowd all hot and ready for you.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,480
I saw Winslow's Steely Dan, that was pretty cool.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,360
I guess you guys aren't reeling in the years. 23 Skadoo.

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,160
And here's my kids. Like the Chilean miners, we've reemerged here.

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,160
We've been buried deep below the King's theater and now have reemerged here.

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,840
That was a weird, why did we do that?

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't know, but it was beautiful down there. A lot of bodies, a weird amount of bodies.

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
I found out something interesting today, guys. I have limits.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,480
I think I know what it might be.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,080
It is that I have limits. My passion for,

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,760
I don't want to say bad things, but I guess bad things, the lower end of-

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Garbage things.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
Hurting yourself with questionable cuisine.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,000
The lower end of culture, I think, is well documented. Food culture, specifically cuisine.

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
We're in Food City, right?

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Food City, USA.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Great spots to eat, great spots to dine.

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
I was like, ooh, I went to this great Italian place up in Harlem.

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Oh, that's one of the best ramen I've ever had in my life.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,040
The great wine list, you gotta check it out.

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,960
Shrimp company and all the other-

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,640
Wait, which one?

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Just the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company I went to today.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,360
I don't think I've heard of that one. Justin, can you give me a little bit of background?

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
We had, it was very cold.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,200
Damn, dude. That's the first thing you got to lay down at Bubba Gump's feet.

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,880
The one thing about it is, here's some good reasons to go there. It's very cold,

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,320
and it is inside. The one thing you can say for Bubba Gump Shrimp Company is it is indoors.

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,960
That's huge. I had two kids with me, and they were, you know, kids.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,040
And it was cold, so we went into Bubba Gump.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,440
Well, we were trying to choose between Bubba Gump Shrimp Company and Hard Rock Cafe, and I said-

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
Oh, how can you choose?

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,800
I know. I said Bubba Gump should be more-

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, was Applebee's closed?

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
Bubba Gump should be-

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh, there was a weight of the Olive Garden.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,840
The Olive Garden. I said it would be more hilarious, so I went there.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Not realizing that in addition to getting material for my podcast,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
I would have to eat the food with my human body.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,200
Here's the thing. I'm not picky. This is law. This is settled law. I'm not a picky-

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,600
It was bad, guys. I don't know how to say it, except the food was bad.

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,400
The experience, though, was bad.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,200
There was- They have a sign on the table, and you can flip it, right?

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
And if it's blue, it says, Run Forrest, Run.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
And that means the server can just go right on by.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,920
And if you need something, you flip it to red, and it says, Stop Forrest, Stop.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,200
And any server in the place will stop at your table to see what you need, except none of them care.

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,040
I can flip that bastard back and forth. No one gave a solitary shit.

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,640
Their magic shoes carry them right back to the break room.

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,360
Right back. No one actually addressed any of my many needs.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
What I did enjoy was the table right next to us.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,120
Sydney kept nudging me, and there's a table of two middle-aged people

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,880
sharing what appeared to be a bottle of wine they brought from home.

64
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,000
That's very good.

65
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm pretty sure they didn't get it from Bubba Gump because it wasn't in a box.

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
So it probably wasn't from there.

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,640
But I was a little judgy at first.

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,160
But then by the end of the meal, I was like, Fuck, I wish I'd drunk a half bottle of wine.

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Those people look like they're having the time of their lives.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Right.

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,280
We had peel and eat shrimp that we ordered,

72
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,920
and I said, peel and eat shrimp.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,720
And you know what they said? Do you want spicier garlic?

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Excuse me? For my peel and eat shrimp?

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
They brought them to the table.

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,880
The tails and the legs and stuff were not there.

77
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
The peeling had happened.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
So they were just, and eat shrimp.

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
And eat. And here's the fun thing.

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
All my job was to eat.

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:54,240
And when I did my job, it tasted like bologna exactly.

82
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
So it wasn't hilarious.

83
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,400
I did do, maybe now, tragedy plus time, etc.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,880
Right.

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
Tragedy plus time and pepsin equals comedy.

86
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Did it never really sink in while you're eating at this restaurant

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,280
that you're dining at a themed restaurant named after Tom Hanks' dead friend from that one movie?

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
When you first walk into this place, and we're not just going to talk about this.

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
We'll talk about other things.

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
But when you first walk into this place,

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,320
there is a bench with a box of chocolates permanently adhered to it.

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
And it's been 25 years since this fucking flick came out, guys.

93
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
That's surreal.

94
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,400
Yeah.

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
Like, if I walk in there, I'm like, excuse me?

96
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Can we talk about your art selection?

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
This is very strange.

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
There are people of legal voting age who might now, for the first time,

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
watch Forrest Gump and think, is this a movie based off that restaurant chain?

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,600
Yeah.

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Based off that bad bologna restaurant?

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Hey, what if we do our thing, our usual thing?

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah, can we talk about the...

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah.

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,920
Oh, yeah, why don't we...

106
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,320
I want to start with a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answer Service.

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,000
This first one was sent in by Emma Kant.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Thank you, Emma.

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
It's Yahoo Answers user Viv who asks,

110
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,320
okay, how to quietly eat chips?

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
I eat lunch in the quiet section of the library.

112
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,960
How do I quietly eat my Lays?

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,600
Double brag.

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
The answer is obvious.

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Put it in your mouth.

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,800
Close the mouth.

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,120
Wait five minutes.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Oh, God.

119
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm saying, it's not the pleasant answer.

120
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,200
It's not the answer you choose to do.

121
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,840
But if you're asking me how to quietly consume a chip,

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,920
it is to let that bad boy dissolve in there.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,880
And then you just swallow it like a medicine pill.

124
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
And then you slurp it on down.

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah, man.

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Like an oyster.

127
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,520
I would get as many Pringles as I wanted for that serving

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,760
and put them all in my mouth at the same time

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,200
and then bite them all at once and say, oops.

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,720
I farted.

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
All right.

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
No one would ever suspect.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
Why would he lie about that?

134
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,960
It's a perfect crime.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,040
Unless you have a terrible gastric incident.

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,360
They are two sounds that sound very different.

137
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
They don't know.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,080
Okay, so in your reality, someone's like,

139
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
I've heard you fart before.

140
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,000
That's bullshit.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
No, what I'm saying is they might hear you fart and say,

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
I've heard a human fart before.

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I've heard a human fart before.

144
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Nice try, bub.

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,800
You sound like a wood chipper.

146
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Are you okay?

147
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
I am also-

148
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,040
I'm sorry, did your bowl just crunch?

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
I am also-

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
Can you stop popping for a minute?

151
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
What have you been eating?

152
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,520
Have you been eating those poppers

153
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,280
you throw at the ground and they snap?

154
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm also a robot.

155
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
I meant to tell you guys.

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
And those are my sound of my various gears

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
cranking and whirring away.

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Okay.

159
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,800
Can you sit next to the library grandfather clock

160
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
and eat a chip a second?

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
That's very good.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

163
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
You're going to have to get really good,

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
like two tubes of Pringles just kind of alternating

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
back and forth at double hand motion.

166
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
And then when you run out, you have to loudly exclaim,

167
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,120
your clock broke.

168
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Stop making noise.

169
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
Now this one would take a little investment

170
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
and a little pre-planning.

171
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay.

172
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
But could you get a book bound

173
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,840
and you write on the cover a book about eating chips

174
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,400
and then you eat behind it.

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,760
And someone's going to look over and go,

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
and go, oh, it's just a really good book.

177
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,400
Oh yeah.

178
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
This is an audio book.

179
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,360
That's nothing.

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
It's like one of those greeting cards that makes noises.

181
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,940
Yeah.

182
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
This is an immersive book experience.

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
And then you, and they're like, what happened?

184
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
And you say, I just found the chips in here.

185
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Could you just do it in the bathroom?

186
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
Could you just stand up and loudly announce,

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,080
I have to go to the bathroom for the other reason.

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
If I walked into a public restroom

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
and saw a human being just standing there eating chips,

190
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
I would call the police.

191
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,600
No, I went to someone who once walked into a bathroom

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
and saw someone eating corn on the cob.

193
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,440
Yes.

194
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,840
I think chips would be much less confrontational.

195
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,120
Okay.

196
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
This is how that scene would play out.

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
You walk in, you make eye contact and they go,

198
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
I want it to be quiet.

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Okay. I'm going to go pee in the periodicals.

200
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,520
I would probably get a little sassy about it

201
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
and just assume they're lucky I'm at a library.

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah.

203
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
My mind went to, I would say like, I'll let you go,

204
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,280
but you got to cut me in on this chips deal.

205
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,000
But I don't think a bathroom's where I want stranger chips.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,320
I fucking love that show, man.

207
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
We also take questions from the audience

208
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
and we try to help those people.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Here's the first one.

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
I am a father of a five and a half year old girl

211
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
who loves Barbies and especially loves

212
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
when I play Barbies with her.

213
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
Normally she's very creative

214
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
making her own DIY Barbie clothes and furniture,

215
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
but a problem arises when it comes

216
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
to actually play with the dolls.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,520
The scenarios she puts her Barbies in

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,200
are devoid of any conflict.

219
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,560
When I play with her,

220
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
I try to instill some sort of small crisis

221
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
for the dolls to overcome,

222
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,960
like running late to the airport or fighting a monster.

223
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,040
Every time I try to create some sort of story,

224
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
my daughter argues that only good things can happen

225
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
and pretty much gives me a script

226
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,960
for what my Barbies are allowed to say and do.

227
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
How can I teach my daughter to craft compelling stories

228
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
so we can keep playing Barbies together?

229
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
That's from Mattel Melodrama in Manhattan.

230
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,440
Are you here?

231
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,120
Hello.

232
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,280
You could just chill and have a cake party, JJ Abrams.

233
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,160
Chill the fuck out.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,500
Nope.

235
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Hard disagree.

236
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
When we play with our children,

237
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
we are not playing to have fun,

238
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,160
we're playing to teach.

239
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,560
In this day and age of content generation,

240
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
multi-transmedia, multi-year streaming deals,

241
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,280
the number one skill you can pass on to your children

242
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,600
is fucking narrative crafting.

243
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah, can't wait for Charlie and BB

244
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
to get their shows on see-so too.

245
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
Hey everybody, thanks for joining me.

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,640
It's another episode of my actual play Barbie podcast.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,960
You gotta teach these kids how to do a story.

248
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah.

249
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
Because here's my bet, right?

250
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,680
Your daughter likes when nice things happen to Barbie

251
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,520
because your daughter likes Barbie.

252
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,160
And I get that, but can you explain to her

253
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
that that's not going to strengthen

254
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
Barbie's will of character?

255
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
It's not gonna make her tough.

256
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,040
Here's the thing, yes, that's nice,

257
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
but what is she learning?

258
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
Is five and a half too young

259
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,400
to learn about the hero's journey?

260
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,680
Yes, thank you.

261
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Thank you.

262
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
Listen, yes, Barbie thought she was doing okay,

263
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
but she had to lose it all to find out how much she had.

264
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,080
A daddy production.

265
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
Barbie has to grow.

266
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
Barbie has to learn.

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,240
Yes.

268
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, Barbie's great.

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
But like, what if Barbie had challenges

270
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
that she had to overcome?

271
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
And do you care more about Barbie

272
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
now that she's succeeded or failed?

273
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,320
I don't know.

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Right, maybe-

275
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
We're still so early, we're storyboarding.

276
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
Maybe Ken loses his job.

277
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
Barbie has to take on a second job to cover

278
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
and then he finds that he really likes being at home.

279
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,520
And Barbie's not cool with that

280
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,040
because that fucking sucks.

281
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,760
That's interesting.

282
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
Right, and then they talk through their problems.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
Now their marriage is stronger than ever.

284
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,560
Okay, now I'm getting the-

285
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
Okay, I'm on the daughter's side now.

286
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,880
I just flipped.

287
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,640
Yes, thank you.

288
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,360
Welcome.

289
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,920
Welcome to the team.

290
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,960
You don't want to see Ken and Barbie

291
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,400
deal with their marital issues?

292
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,920
See, I had a fix for this,

293
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
that I was like, this is a good idea.

294
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm going to say this out loud.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
And then I was like, no, it's not a good fix.

296
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,560
My fix for it was,

297
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
just imagine the drama in your own mind,

298
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,760
which is to say,

299
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
Barbie is going to leave Ken one of these days

300
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
and doesn't know how to do it.

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
And just keep that in your play with Ken.

302
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,960
But at that point,

303
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,600
your play is going to be different

304
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
and the daughter's going to know why.

305
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes, I do that with Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

306
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
Right, you're just assuming

307
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
they're eating the gazelles off screen.

308
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
Well, the thing that I'm always wondering is,

309
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,280
what happened to Prince Monday?

310
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,680
And I think about it all the time.

311
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
When I'm watching that show,

312
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,960
I believe that there was a bloody coup

313
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,160
in which Prince Tuesday overthrew Prince Monday.

314
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,720
Right.

315
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
And I think about it all the time.

316
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
I know the problem.

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Barbie and Ken can be happy.

318
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
They should be happy.

319
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
But who's that that just moved in next door?

320
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
Third wheel adding some drama into the story.

321
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,400
It's kind of like Stinky Doug or whatever,

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,880
you know?

323
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,520
You need your Dupree of your... you mean Dupree.

324
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,320
You need your Dupree.

325
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh, this is Scalator has moved in.

326
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
Scalator moved in next door.

327
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
The property values are dropping.

328
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
Now you're at drama.

329
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,280
Is she too young to learn about the Stinky Doug journey?

330
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,440
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Sophie.

331
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
Thank you, Sophie.

332
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,400
It's Yahoo answers user Michael, who asks,

333
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,560
we have soft flesh on the outside

334
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,240
and hard bone on the inside.

335
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
OK, you've got Justin's attention.

336
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
Now reel him in halfway through.

337
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
We have soft flesh on the inside and on the outside

338
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
and hard bone on the inside.

339
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Stop selling.

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Stop selling.

341
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,440
I love it.

342
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,800
Animals like crabs and insects have soft in the inside,

343
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,920
hard on the outside.

344
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,760
How does that work?

345
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,080
Huh?

346
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
How do they even move without bones in there?

347
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
Right?

348
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
Is it just their jelly squishing around until they...

349
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Jelly pushing up against their armor.

350
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
Well, this seems like a poor design choice.

351
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,280
Thank you.

352
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
If you could trade...

353
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,440
I hate seeing you hold that microphone.

354
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,080
I do not know.

355
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
If you could trade feeling the breath of your newborn baby

356
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
on the nape of your neck.

357
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,240
If you could trade that for bitchin' armor

358
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
that helps you to sever your enemies.

359
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,480
Yes.

360
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
Obviously, right?

361
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes, obviously.

362
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
I mean, listen, we've all dreamed of a mugger

363
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
pulling a knife on you, going to stab you on

364
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,280
and shatters against your carapace.

365
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
No knives, no knives.

366
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,640
There's no more violence.

367
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
We fixed violence.

368
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
There's no point.

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,680
Everyone's got armor.

370
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
Everyone's got exoplating.

371
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
There's no point in doing crimes.

372
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,880
Everybody's got claws for hands and exoplating.

373
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,200
There's no crime anymore.

374
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,160
What would be the point?

375
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,880
I mean, there would still be...

376
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,760
You could still embezzle, even if everybody had a carapace.

377
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,400
Are you gonna embezzle if you know your boss has giant exoclaws?

378
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, because in the world you've posited,

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
he can't get through my armor.

380
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,680
Some people have better claws than other people.

381
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,440
Okay, so now there is some...

382
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,320
There's still disparity.

383
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,520
There's still some violence.

384
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
There's still haves and have-nots,

385
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,240
but we don't fix it through crime.

386
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,280
There's no more crime.

387
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,760
Oh, okay.

388
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
There's no violent crime.

389
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,200
There's no white collar crime, Travis.

390
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,840
Milk is a controlled substance in this world

391
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,120
because we don't want the imbalance to get too wild.

392
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,880
I love the skull.

393
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
The skull's great.

394
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,360
God, I love the skull.

395
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
I'm wild about it.

396
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Cool stuff.

397
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,040
Brain helmet and my skin.

398
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Good stuff.

399
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,400
I love how if they cut through the top of my face,

400
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,240
it'll stop because the skull will stop before the brain.

401
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
Skull says not so fast.

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,720
But wait, here's...

403
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
My friend brain is in here.

404
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Let me flip it on you.

405
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,560
If there's a part they can't cut through,

406
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
let's put that on the outside.

407
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,680
Then I don't even got to worry about knives no more.

408
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,560
God, come on.

409
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,520
As long as we're doing a note session for God,

410
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
I would also say rib cage.

411
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
I love that.

412
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
Protecting my thing.

413
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,680
Why'd you put holes in there?

414
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,200
This protects everything.

415
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
Why would you have holes?

416
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
It stops in my tummy area.

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,840
And we're talking about vulnerabilities.

418
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
You know my brain's in here.

419
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
You know that that soup's important.

420
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
And we love the skull.

421
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
Love the skull.

422
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
But can we talk about the two holes you put in the front

423
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
with the bullseyes in front of them made of jelly?

424
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
Are you sure?

425
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,320
And this thing here, that if it's hit wrong, I die.

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,040
I die?

427
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
The thing that's literally in front of me all the time.

428
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,680
You put a hoops destruct button on the front of my face?

429
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,360
Are you sure?

430
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,960
And also, as long as we're at it, weak points here, here,

431
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
here, here, here, here, here.

432
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,320
Solid bone.

433
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
Thank you.

434
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,400
Also, if sugar bad, why it tastes so good.

435
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,120
Yes.

436
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,840
Thank you.

437
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
You got to help me help you.

438
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Why does the sugar make our mouth bones fall out?

439
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
Yes, and while we're talking about mouth bones,

440
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
why I got to floss one solid piece.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
One big, one solid chomper.

442
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
I love your son.

443
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
All his great stuff.

444
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,040
I'm crazy about it.

445
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,760
But the two holes in the front are so bad.

446
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm not wild about that.

447
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,160
Not wild about it.

448
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,280
What if I had plating right here that I had to flip up?

449
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes, to say cool stuff or eat hot dogs.

450
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,920
Imagine it.

451
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,280
I've improved your creation.

452
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
You're very welcome, but I'm your creation.

453
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
So you shouldn't feel bad about it.

454
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,380
Yeah.

455
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,880
Yeah.

456
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
All right, that's asked and answered.

457
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,580
We solved it again.

458
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,700
How many of our questions could we solve

459
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,620
just by giving God some notes?

460
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,820
Is it an issue that I shop for underwear online while at work?

461
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,580
I do have big, very visible monitor,

462
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,340
and it's not like I'm-

463
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
It's not what I thought that sentence was going to-

464
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,540
I have big, very visible underwear.

465
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,900
That's how I like it.

466
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
That's my style.

467
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,300
Prominent.

468
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,580
They hang out the top of my pants and form basically a skirt.

469
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,080
It's rad.

470
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,340
I like my underpants billowy.

471
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,780
I do have very big, visible monitor,

472
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,020
and it's not like I'm in an enclosed office.

473
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,860
Should I just wait to order things in general

474
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,940
when I'm on a personal computer?

475
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,980
That's from still not currently using my personal computer.

476
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,900
I would hope not.

477
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,260
This is a live show.

478
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,620
Are you here?

479
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,780
Oh, no.

480
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,300
That was fucking chilling.

481
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,380
They got caught.

482
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,940
They're in jail.

483
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,660
Well, if you ever run into this exact scenario at your job,

484
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,860
I guess we can keep going.

485
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Hey, maybe don't shop for anything

486
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,540
while you're at work on your big, visible monitor.

487
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,220
Okay.

488
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,100
It's been a long time since any of us have had like-

489
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,820
Office jobs.

490
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,860
Office jobs.

491
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,180
It's not 100% of the time work.

492
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,980
Right?

493
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,780
We all know that.

494
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,220
You've got a lot of time to yourself.

495
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,020
You make-

496
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,740
Right.

497
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,140
If you're there for, say, nine hours,

498
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,980
you're doing three hours of work.

499
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,700
Wow.

500
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,940
Fucking employee of the month.

501
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
I would say, though, if somebody's like,

502
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,620
Justin, that's not a work time activity.

503
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,700
I'd say, well, I need the underwear to come to work.

504
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,860
If I don't got these, I can't come in, okay?

505
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,300
You don't want that.

506
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,940
I don't want that.

507
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,980
You need them for work.

508
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,780
You don't want me having stuff wicked away from my business?

509
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,620
I got to wick stuff away if I'm going to sit here

510
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,580
and handle the big account.

511
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,100
I need top-notch wicking.

512
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,540
Are you watching YouTube video reviews of cereal?

513
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,380
I got to eat the cereal to get calories for work energy.

514
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes.

515
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,380
It's a business expense.

516
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,020
It's a work thing.

517
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,300
You could do what I did when I worked for Tommy Smurl

518
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,060
and wanted to watch a vid

519
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,940
or listen to some Pandora tunes

520
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,220
where I would just get the browser window real small.

521
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,780
Oops.

522
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,100
Like a secret microscope.

523
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,900
Hello, underwear.

524
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,380
You can't see all of it at once.

525
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,180
You got to just look.

526
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,780
So even if somebody was looking at your computer,

527
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,620
they'd be like, that's a fucked up pop-up ad.

528
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,260
I'm getting underwear.

529
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,100
Thanks, Tommy.

530
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,260
He'll never catch me.

531
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,820
I understand that you have a big, visible monitor

532
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,340
and you work in like an open thing,

533
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,940
but could you do something like this

534
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,100
where you have the monitor and you shop like this?

535
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,300
And then when someone comes in, they're like,

536
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,100
what are you doing?

537
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,500
And you're just like, I hurt myself.

538
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,740
This is how I have to look at my computer from now on.

539
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,620
Can you take your computer monitor into the bathroom?

540
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,100
This one also solves a lot of problems.

541
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,340
Yeah.

542
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
That's why I spent most of my jobs in the bathroom.

543
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,620
Not this one.

544
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,580
You'll be happy to hear.

545
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,220
I do most of this one in the office, but...

546
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,380
Oh, I'd like to play out a scenario here.

547
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,260
Okay, sure.

548
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,580
Justin, I would like you to play the boss.

549
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,060
Okay.

550
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,980
What kind of a boss am I?

551
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,660
You like to think you're everybody's friend,

552
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,220
but listen, you're still all about the bottom line.

553
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,740
So a boss then?

554
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,240
Yeah.

555
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,020
And you've just walked up to my desk.

556
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,580
Who am I?

557
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,420
Who am I in the scene?

558
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,340
You're kind of the office prankster.

559
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,140
You're the boss.

560
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,860
You're the boss.

561
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,580
You're the boss.

562
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,300
You're the boss.

563
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,820
You're kind of the office prankster,

564
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,980
but you really haven't done a joke in a while.

565
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,220
Okay.

566
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,820
Because you're going through something at home.

567
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,940
Right, sure, sure, sure.

568
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,020
And everyone still thinks of you as the office prankster,

569
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
and here, in a couple days, we'll put together...

570
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,820
Okay.

571
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,860
So you've just walked up,

572
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,500
and I'm shopping for underwear on my computer.

573
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,340
Travis.

574
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,380
Oh, no, my name's Derek.

575
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,700
Sorry, that was on me.

576
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,340
Okay.

577
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,820
Continue.

578
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,300
Derek, you're...

579
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,900
Give me all the money in the office.

580
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,700
I've got a katana.

581
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,900
Okay, hold on.

582
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,500
One note.

583
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,100
Was that meant to be a prank, or are you playing that?

584
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,980
Well, it depends.

585
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,380
How rough is this stuff I'm going through at home?

586
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,380
Not quite there.

587
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,180
Okay, it's a prank.

588
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,980
It's a prank, yeah.

589
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,060
Oh, other Derek.

590
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,100
Did I scare you?

591
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,380
You did.

592
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,620
You've been practicing with your katana.

593
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,060
Two years, just for this prank.

594
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,940
I know that it's not good for me to lead with criticism,

595
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,460
so I'm going to try to ease into it.

596
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,700
Okay.

597
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,180
So, Derek, have you seen this...

598
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,020
This new movie, The Joker, everybody's talking about.

599
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,420
Have you seen this, The Joker?

600
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,860
The one with Jared Leto?

601
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,860
I don't get out to see the movies very much.

602
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,940
Shh, they make Peg nauseous.

603
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,740
Anyway, my wife, Peg, that I have.

604
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:46,900
Yeah.

605
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,460
Oh, you have a wife, Peg?

606
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,420
My wife, Peg, you've met her at the party.

607
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,220
Yes.

608
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,020
Anyway, this computer screen you got going around,

609
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,140
I love how most of it's work, but some of it's underwear.

610
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,940
Yeah.

611
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,860
Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

612
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,020
I was shopping for a present for you.

613
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,940
Aww.

614
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,660
Oh, boy.

615
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,140
That's really nice, but if Peg finds underwear

616
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,460
that she doesn't buy me in my drawers,

617
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,100
I think we're going to have a little bit of a problem at home.

618
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,900
Holy shit!

619
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,940
Oh, no, he's dying!

620
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,020
Under, Derek, get over here!

621
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,420
You see me behind him with two knives in his back.

622
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,380
Haha, yes!

623
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,300
No, you took the prank too far!

624
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,940
Gotcha!

625
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,780
That's not a prank, you've killed him!

626
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Blood gush, blood gush, blood gush.

627
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,140
If only we had our hard stuff on the outside!

628
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,860
None of this would have happened.

629
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,700
No, no.

630
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,460
Unseen, I guess.

631
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,580
Here's another Yahoo that was sent in by Debra.

632
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,980
That's a listener of our show!

633
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,700
Yeah, that's fair.

634
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Thank you, Debra, she said in a normal voice.

635
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,500
Rae, if you're listening, your voice is normal, it's fine.

636
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,260
We all have different instruments.

637
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,780
Ma.

638
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,900
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user, Ted, who asks,

639
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,260
Matthew McConaughey fanfiction?

640
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Does anyone know where I can find fanfiction

641
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,140
about Matthew McConaughey?

642
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,900
The internet?

643
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,860
The internet?

644
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,540
It doesn't need to be anything crazy,

645
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,820
just like going about his life and maybe a mystery happens.

646
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,420
Okay, listen, I was prepared to perhaps mock this person.

647
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,740
Right.

648
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,140
As we so often do, but if there was a TV show.

649
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,460
Right.

650
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,940
In which Matthew McConaughey played himself,

651
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,020
just trying to go about his life, making movies,

652
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,540
Fools Gold 2 or whatever.

653
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,260
Right.

654
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,900
And also mysteries just kept popping up

655
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,140
and no one else is going to take care of him except him.

656
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,540
Right.

657
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,900
I would watch the fuck out of that!

658
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
That was True Detective, basically.

659
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,020
Dang!

660
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,940
Okay, so here's how we're going to do it.

661
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,180
Okay.

662
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,900
We're going to do one word at a time.

663
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,700
Jesus Christ.

664
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,180
And then it'll be the rest of the show.

665
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,020
Now we're just going to build and see if we can come up

666
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,940
with anything good and if it's bad,

667
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,540
if the story starts to go wrong, we'll jettison it and start again.

668
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,340
I'll start.

669
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,300
Matthew.

670
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,260
Broderick.

671
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,500
Fuck.

672
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,820
That close.

673
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,180
Fuck.

674
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,380
He could still be there.

675
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,580
He could still be there.

676
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,500
There was no prompt in there that said,

677
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,260
and please don't include Matthew Broderick.

678
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,140
McConaughey, Broderick's his middle name.

679
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,700
Nice.

680
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,420
Okay.

681
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,140
Was.

682
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,100
Pulled it from the fire.

683
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,580
Drinking.

684
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,460
A.

685
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,380
Whiskey.

686
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,880
Ooh.

687
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,560
An.

688
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,460
It's you.

689
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,960
Milk.

690
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,920
With.

691
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,360
A.

692
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,200
Tall.

693
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,020
Matthew.

694
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,660
Statue.

695
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,140
It's a statue of Matthew McConaughey.

696
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,980
So far, this story rules.

697
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,540
So good.

698
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,260
I don't think this is working.

699
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,860
Let's get the mystery in there.

700
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,260
Okay.

701
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,460
Let's start again.

702
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,420
No, we'll keep going.

703
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,060
Faster though.

704
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,460
Okay.

705
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,940
Right, right.

706
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,900
We're overthinking it.

707
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,620
Yes, you're right.

708
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:37,780
Okay.

709
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,220
Gunshots.

710
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,300
Rang out.

711
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,940
In.

712
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,580
The.

713
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,080
Car.

714
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,820
Okay, I messed up.

715
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,660
This is the shortest mystery.

716
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,740
No, play it out.

717
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,240
And.

718
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,480
He.

719
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,920
He instilled.

720
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,680
Hope.

721
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,180
In.

722
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,000
Generation.

723
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,500
Of.

724
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,760
Musicians.

725
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,680
Anyways.

726
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
The end.

727
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
We've done it again.

728
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Not bad.

729
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,480
We didn't even get to the dog or love interest I had planned.

730
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,080
Do you think mysteries just naturally happened during Matthew McConaughey's day?

731
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,120
In which case, this would not be fan fiction, but non-fiction.

732
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,640
This would just be his diary.

733
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,120
Yes.

734
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,080
The memoir.

735
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,280
I think any mystery that happens in Matthew McConaughey's life ends with,

736
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,520
it was Woody Harrelson that stole my weed.

737
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,320
Oh, that's right.

738
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,040
I left my bongos at Woody Harrelson's house.

739
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,800
Something along those lines.

740
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,280
That's right.

741
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,040
I asked Woody Harrelson to wash my dog.

742
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,540
Right.

743
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,940
Anyway, should we do another question?

744
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,940
My office holds mandatory annual safety meetings, but I skipped this year's meeting

745
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,020
to go to the DC MBMBAM show in September.

746
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,380
HR told me no problem.

747
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,620
Just come to the makeup meeting.

748
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,260
But then they scheduled the makeup meeting for today.

749
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,300
And I missed it to see MBMBAM live again.

750
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,620
In my defense, I bought the tickets way before they scheduled the meetings.

751
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,420
It's less cool.

752
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,300
You should have just left it.

753
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,940
Anyway, I like to do better when you're a rebel.

754
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:30,140
Can you give me the lowdown on office safety so that I can accomplish both things today?

755
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,140
That's from Super Save and Silver Spring.

756
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,940
Are you here?

757
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,940
Oh, real close.

758
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,440
Hello.

759
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,100
In the splash zone.

760
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,660
Hey, Paulie, can I trouble you for a little bit more wine whenever you get a second?

761
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,700
Little vino.

762
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,260
Thank you, Paul.

763
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,220
Little vino, Paul.

764
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,860
Thank you, by the way.

765
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,100
So, I'm going to ask you a question.

766
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,380
Thank you, bud.

767
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,820
So, first and foremost, you've got to find a comfortable level, angle, height for your chair.

768
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,180
You're going to sit in it every day.

769
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,220
And you're going to think, I'm a little uncomfortable now, but it's fine.

770
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,260
I just got to get to work.

771
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,820
And then you're going to be at that job for 46 years.

772
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,320
Yes.

773
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,380
And it's going to break your insides.

774
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:06,860
Yeah.

775
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,620
Get a comfortable chair.

776
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,100
Yeah.

777
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,260
Spine will be all twisted up like hollow bread.

778
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,540
It'll be a nightmare.

779
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,700
Next, the printer is super heavy.

780
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,460
Thank you.

781
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,260
Yeah.

782
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,380
So, be careful about that.

783
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,140
That's going to sound like a challenge.

784
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,060
And you're going to think, oh, yeah?

785
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,500
It's not a challenge.

786
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,940
It's a warning and a threat.

787
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,140
Don't try to pick up the printer.

788
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,100
It's really fucking heavy.

789
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,260
This isn't us saying the printer's heavy for most people, but some people.

790
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,100
This is like even Chad can't pick it up.

791
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,900
And he's ripped.

792
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,780
He's really strong.

793
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,900
He works out all the time.

794
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,340
And I saw him try to lift it.

795
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,260
And he went, oh, that's heavy.

796
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,140
That's how heavy the printer is.

797
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,860
You're telling me Chad, who was on the cover of the October issue of Big Guys Monthly, can't

798
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,220
lift it, but you think you can?

799
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,660
The printer's so fucking heavy.

800
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,020
Don't.

801
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,500
Be smart about this.

802
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,300
Also, don't do stair tricks.

803
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,900
I know it's exciting.

804
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,660
You want to do tricks on the stairs.

805
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,500
You want to impress the young guy who just got a job in the mail room and has a sick

806
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,860
scooter and he can do stair tricks, but he's a young guy.

807
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,020
And stair tricks are a young man's game.

808
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,380
Don't impress him that way.

809
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,620
Impress him by like buying him beer or something.

810
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,980
He'll appreciate that.

811
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,540
Don't do stair tricks, especially not if you're carrying the super heavy printer.

812
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,900
Don't touch the fucking printer.

813
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,700
No, but I'm saying if you did, but if you did touch the printer.

814
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,780
No sunglasses at work.

815
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,460
You're indoors.

816
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,420
It's too dark.

817
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,020
You're going to fall down the stairs.

818
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,700
Don't turn off all the lights so it's a quote, even playing field.

819
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,060
No one will be able to see your sunglasses.

820
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,180
It's pointless.

821
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,580
Also, and they probably would be too scared to even cover this in a meeting.

822
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,500
But we're going to talk about emotional safety.

823
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,420
Don't Janice is going to compliment you.

824
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,780
Right?

825
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,660
She is.

826
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,620
She wants something.

827
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,180
Yeah, she is using it.

828
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,980
Don't trust Janice.

829
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,580
Not everybody can use the forklift.

830
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:01,980
Yes.

831
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,980
They make it look easy.

832
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,620
It's not.

833
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:05,820
It's cool.

834
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,780
I played Shenmue.

835
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,820
It doesn't matter.

836
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,260
It doesn't work that way.

837
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,460
You will find nary an X button on the entire thing.

838
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:19,020
Now, if you could, I'm not saying don't do it, but if you could use the forklift to eat with

839
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,860
and film it and put it on YouTube and have it be like a whole viral thing of like,

840
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,940
I ate with a forklift.

841
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,860
Like that is pretty good.

842
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,700
And that might impress the guy in the mail room.

843
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:28,940
Yeah.

844
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,460
And I know what you're thinking.

845
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,780
Forklift, copier, loophole.

846
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,700
I'm lifting it with a copier, the forklift.

847
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,900
It's not going to work.

848
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,780
It's not going to work.

849
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,660
It's too heavy.

850
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,500
It is a printer and scanner and fax machine.

851
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,300
All in one.

852
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,500
That's heavy.

853
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,140
Don't go in the elephant pen because you think you can beat them in a fight.

854
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,340
This is if you work at a zoo.

855
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,180
Yeah, I'm specific to that.

856
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,060
If you work at a zoo, I could do a lot just off the top of my head.

857
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Lift your knees.

858
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,020
Lift with your knees.

859
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,460
No, I like the first one better.

860
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,340
Hey, come on, Mr. High Stepper.

861
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,980
Get him up there.

862
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,940
And I'll help you to not trip on Lego buildings.

863
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,900
It's true.

864
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,420
That's true if you lift your knees, they're way up off the floor.

865
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,700
Something I was thinking about.

866
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,340
Breaking.

867
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,020
This just came in.

868
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,700
This is breaking news.

869
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,300
This is a breaking.

870
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,780
Shit.

871
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,060
Whoa, yeah.

872
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,580
This is a breaking on a doll watch.

873
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,140
Just came in.

874
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,100
I got a notification.

875
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,260
I love what happens when I'm at a show already.

876
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,460
It's really convenient.

877
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,580
Yeah, it's weird when it just happens, like, at home or while you're sleeping or something.

878
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,740
Yeah, true.

879
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,220
Hey, if it just came in, why are you having to search through your phone?

880
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,940
Does it not serve?

881
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,780
I want to bring up a photo.

882
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,020
We'll cut this part out, but just so y'all can...

883
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,180
Holy fucking shit.

884
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,860
So what's up?

885
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,660
This is a...

886
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,500
Monster.

887
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,540
Protection troll doll.

888
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Mystical forest idol.

889
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,260
Rare.

890
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,060
Haunted.

891
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,140
That's right, a troll haunted doll.

892
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,900
All of our interests are colliding.

893
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,340
Do I need to buy another protection doll to protect me from this doll?

894
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,140
Yes.

895
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,020
Okay, cool.

896
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,460
It's the perfect scam.

897
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,620
This is from Curious Imports.

898
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,820
This is written in the style...

899
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,540
I mean...

900
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,220
It looks like an E.E. Cummings poem.

901
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,300
Yeah, it's structured in a very fun way.

902
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,700
All right.

903
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,580
Protection troll.

904
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,020
By Langston Hughes.

905
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,420
New resin.

906
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Stands for inches high.

907
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,460
Measurement does not include the hair.

908
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,420
Good?

909
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,540
No need to brag.

910
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,900
Oh, don't worry.

911
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,260
Hey, I'm not counting the hair.

912
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,860
This is your personal protection troll.

913
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,380
Then why do they have it?

914
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,020
He will protect you and keep you safe.

915
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,220
While keeping you safe, he will make sure that no one can harm you.

916
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,420
An important component.

917
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,500
You'll agree to keeping you safe.

918
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,260
Give me all your money.

919
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,980
Good luck, Robert.

920
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,500
I have this toy.

921
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,940
No one can make sure that no one can harm you

922
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,540
or come in your life to bring harm.

923
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,300
We all know some people like that.

924
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,860
Janice.

925
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,820
Protects against thieves and criminals.

926
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,660
Cancel your ADT.

927
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,820
You've got this troll.

928
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,420
Keeps your personal possessions safe and you from harm.

929
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,140
We've established that at this point.

930
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,020
I think that this is my bodyguard and it's a troll.

931
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,380
It is said that when you hold him and speak to him, he will listen.

932
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,860
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

933
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,500
I always love a knees, by the way, when I set and start with it is said

934
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,700
as if the person writing it isn't the only one saying it.

935
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,380
I am saying that you can talk to it.

936
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,580
I guess.

937
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,140
And also, what's the other option?

938
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,300
You start talking to the troll and the troll's always goes.

939
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,300
Pulls out his phone.

940
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,100
To keep your troll doll happy, offer him some sunflower seeds.

941
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,780
Okay, I didn't know this was a transactional protection

942
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,620
because now that you sound like you're in the mob.

943
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,300
Yeah, what if I don't give him enough seeds?

944
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,820
Will he let someone harm me?

945
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,220
I'll keep you and your small business safe.

946
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,940
Don't worry about it.

947
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,660
Just slimy some of them sunflower seeds.

948
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,180
Some more seeds.

949
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,060
Oh, your last shipment didn't include the juice.

950
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,780
So offer him some sunflower seeds or a small flower.

951
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,980
Seeds or a small glass of water or wine.

952
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,860
Just sit this next to him and you may notice it gone.

953
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,900
I don't think I will.

954
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,180
Probably not.

955
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,260
Also, I know what will get you better protection

956
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,100
between the water and the wine.

957
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,620
I want this troll drunk and I want him angry.

958
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,820
Now hold on.

959
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,380
I don't know that I want my protector spirit drunk.

960
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,820
No troll, stop the criminal.

961
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,100
What?

962
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,260
Shit.

963
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,740
If you hear movement in the home at night,

964
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
that is when trolls become most active.

965
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:29,980
Okay.

966
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,780
It only means he is making sure everything is safe.

967
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:32,940
Okay.

968
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,980
Okay, you have now told this person,

969
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,100
one, this troll will keep you safe.

970
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,460
Two, if you hear someone breaking into your home,

971
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,260
it's probably the troll.

972
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,380
That's the sound.

973
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,740
Do not call the police.

974
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,380
That's the sound of safety.

975
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,740
Honey, do you hear something?

976
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,020
Don't worry, darling.

977
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,060
It's the troll.

978
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,620
Go back to sleep and enjoy that diamond necklace you're wearing.

979
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,540
Once you bond to your troll,

980
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,500
his energy will be with you and travel with you.

981
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,420
You do not need to carry him with you.

982
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,140
Okay, so I'm at the double tree Philadelphia.

983
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,100
I hear a glass smash and someone comes in,

984
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,060
starts rooting around.

985
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,580
It's fine, sweetheart.

986
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,020
It's the troll.

987
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,940
That's how you know that it's the troll.

988
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,620
It's the troll. That's how you know that his spirit is still with us.

989
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:22,860
Yeah.

990
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,340
Oh, and you know,

991
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,220
I probably forgot to leave a bowl of sunflower seeds for him.

992
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,580
He's probably just a hunky boy.

993
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,020
Get this little guy with you while you can.

994
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,420
Very rare and hard to find.

995
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,340
It's a fucking troll doll that you painted black a little bit.

996
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,020
I mean, he's on eBay.

997
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,780
Not that hard.

998
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,020
Yeah.

999
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,500
As all of you that have shopped with us before,

1000
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,620
get this while you can.

1001
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,740
Our items go fast.

1002
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,620
This is what I like.

1003
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,500
This is the only time this will be listed on eBay.

1004
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,860
When the auction is over, we will not relist this item.

1005
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,700
Oh, no.

1006
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,020
Wait, isn't that how it always works?

1007
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,740
No, no, no.

1008
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,660
This person's saying you have one chance to buy it.

1009
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,220
If you don't buy him now, he's sticking with me.

1010
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,380
I've grown too attached.

1011
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,860
Or I have to throw him into a volcano,

1012
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,100
which is what the scroll said to do.

1013
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,540
By the way, there's a scroll.

1014
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,900
It's so important that you read it, but I did lose it.

1015
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,100
Where's the part where it's like,

1016
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
by the way, this is all bullshit.

1017
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,220
You're buying garbage.

1018
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,500
eBay makes me say this.

1019
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,780
As required, all metaphysical items are sold as curios.

1020
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,140
No claims are made.

1021
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,020
All information based on historic lore and who do slash mystic beliefs.

1022
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,260
Anything that may or may not happen is up to the one who uses the item.

1023
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,020
Sold for entertainment purposes only.

1024
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,100
This is directly followed by all metaphysical,

1025
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,220
supernatural and haunted items do not have on off switches.

1026
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,140
Some items take some time to work and some work right away.

1027
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:57,260
And then there are some that may not work at all for a person's needs.

1028
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,860
You must consider this with purchasing items.

1029
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,340
If you do not know how to use or active contact us and we can assist you,

1030
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,420
please, for the love that is always holy,

1031
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,020
please figure out a way to redirect those calls to my personal cellular phone.

1032
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
I would do anything to be like, hello?

1033
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,220
Yeah, the trolly.

1034
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:26,220
Listen, I was robbed terribly last night and your troll didn't do anything.

1035
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,580
Well, let me see.

1036
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,060
Let's do some troubleshooting.

1037
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,260
Let's do some troubleshooting.

1038
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,500
Did you leave out sunflower seeds and wine?

1039
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,780
Yeah.

1040
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,140
I don't know what to do for you then.

1041
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,060
I don't know. Not all of them work for some people.

1042
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,220
Did you flip on the on switch?

1043
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,100
That was a test.

1044
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,980
There is a test.

1045
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,620
There isn't one.

1046
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,260
Anyway, that's your haunted doll watch for this week.

1047
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,580
Hey, everybody, it's Griffin.

1048
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,860
Thank you so much for listening to this live episode of My Bim Bam.

1049
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,500
Like we have said the past couple weeks,

1050
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,060
we are sort of filling in time.

1051
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,380
Travis and Teresa just had a baby.

1052
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,020
And so we're giving him a little bit of a break.

1053
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,700
And we will be back with new non-live, I guess,

1054
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,740
dead episodes of My Bim Bam next Monday.

1055
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,380
So stick with us till then.

1056
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,020
This is the second of our Brooklyn shows.

1057
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,980
Actually, it was our first.

1058
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,500
The first one we put up was our second one.

1059
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,300
It's confusing.

1060
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,860
But I hope you're enjoying it.

1061
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,260
And got a couple of sponsors to tell you about real quick.

1062
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,100
The first one is Audible.

1063
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Audible has the books that you listen to, that you hear.

1064
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,460
A lot of people eat books with their eyes.

1065
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,860
Audible says, what about ears, though?

1066
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:50,860
And no matter what your resolution or goal is this year, 2020, 2020 funny,

1067
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,700
why don't you fill your life with laughter and love

1068
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,860
with an audio book at Audible to inspire and motivate you?

1069
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,420
It's real slick.

1070
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,660
And hey, we can help you with that

1071
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,980
because we have a challenge for current and new members.

1072
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,460
If you finish three audio books by March 3,

1073
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,420
you'll get a $20 Amazon credit.

1074
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,220
That's it.

1075
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Audible will keep track of your progress for you.

1076
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
Just go listen to some good books,

1077
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,340
fill your mind and get stronger and better,

1078
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,180
and you're gonna get a $20 Amazon credit.

1079
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,980
That's a great deal.

1080
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,380
If you're looking for someone to listen to,

1081
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,260
what about Medallion Status from John Hodgman?

1082
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
I'm digging into that one now.

1083
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:35,260
And it's a lot of fun and it's very enriching to me spiritually.

1084
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,980
You can choose three titles every month,

1085
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,460
one audio book and two exclusive Audible originals

1086
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,380
that you can't hear anywhere else.

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,620
You can listen on any device, anytime, anywhere,

1088
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,420

1093
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,780
Also, I wanna tell you about Squarespace.

1094
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,900
Squarespace, they build the websites.

1095
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,820
Technically, I guess you build the websites,

1096
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,740
they build the thing you use to build the beautiful websites

1097
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,180
that you can use to showcase your work,

1098
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,100
sell products and services of all kinds,

1099
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,980
or promote your physical or online business,

1100
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,180
or whatever the hell, man.

1101
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,860
I don't think Squarespace is gonna kick in your door

1102
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,820
and be like, wrong.

1103
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,380
They got beautiful customizable templates

1104
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,900
created by world-class designers.

1105
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,620
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

1106
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,300
They have free and secure hosting.

1107
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,620
There's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

1108
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,700
It's a good platform, folks.

1109
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,660
I don't know what else to say.

1110
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,940
We have a couple websites we've made with Squarespace,

1111
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,900
and it's really easy, and it all looks really good.

1112
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,500
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial,

1113
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,060
and when you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother,

1114
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,540

1115
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,900

1116
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,300
Just freaking do it.

1117
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,740
Thanks again for listening.

1118
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,420
Thanks to the King's Theatre for having us

1119
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,340
in this show in Brooklyn.

1120
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,940
It's an absolutely gorgeous venue,

1121
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,620
and we are so fortunate to get to play there.

1122
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,180
We are figuring out sort of spring touring schedule,

1123
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,180
and we'll have more to announce there soon.

1124
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,860
I think there may still be some tickets available

1125
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,700
for our upcoming shows in Cincinnati here in February.

1126
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,660
You can find tickets to that at mcroy.family,

1127
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,980
along with all the other merch and new video stuff,

1128
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,340
Monster Factory stuff, besties stuff,

1129
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,540
all kinds of new, exciting announcements,

1130
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,900
all at mcroy.family.

1131
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,660
And yeah, I think that's probably about it.

1132
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,340
So here's the rest of the episode.

1133
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,340
We'll be back again next Monday with a new episode

1134
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,860
of Movin' Bam, so talk to you then.

1135
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,360
Bye.

1136
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,260
Nearly two decades ago,

1137
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,340
Commander Data sacrificed his life.

1138
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,780
The Greatest Discovery is also about Star Trek Picard.

1139
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,180
Jesse Thorne won't let us stay on the network

1140
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,420
unless we do all the Star Trek series,

1141
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,500
and so here we are doing a show

1142
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,540
about maybe our favorite Star Trek character of all time.

1143
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,460
If you're excited to watch the new Star Trek Picard series

1144
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,420
and you'd like some veteran Star Trek podcasters

1145
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,460
to watch it along with, we're your guys.

1146
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,740
Sorry you're stuck with us.

1147
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,980
The hell are you doing out here, Picard?

1148
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,580
Saving the galaxy?

1149
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,220
So subscribe to The Greatest Discovery.

1150
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,380
You can find it anywhere you find podcasts.

1151
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,220
Or at MaximumFun.org.

1152
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,780
Hello.

1153
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,340
Hello.

1154
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,820
Hey.

1155
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,500
Hey, what's your, what's your name?

1156
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,220
I'm Charlotte.

1157
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,940
Hi, Charlotte.

1158
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,580
Okay, thank you.

1159
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:40,060
A couple years ago, my boyfriend's family rescued a pet pig

1160
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,940
and I really like her to think that I'm not afraid of her,

1161
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,140
even though I am.

1162
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,640
Okay.

1163
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,900
So she's about 250 pounds.

1164
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,020
Holy shit.

1165
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,520
What?

1166
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,980
You're completely justified.

1167
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,340
She's a potbelly pig and she really likes his mom.

1168
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,820
She's okay with his family, but we live about an hour

1169
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,540
and a half away, so we don't see her very often.

1170
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,500
So I haven't really had a chance to like bond with her.

1171
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,980
Establish dominance.

1172
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,020
She isn't really warm to me.

1173
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,520
Right.

1174
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,060
I've kind of given up on the dream of like being cuddly with her

1175
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,420
and friends with her.

1176
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:13,660
Yeah.

1177
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,700
But like to kind of be able to walk past her

1178
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,860
without her kind of intimidating me.

1179
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,420
Yeah, sure.

1180
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,700
You're gonna have to intimidate her.

1181
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm sorry.

1182
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,300
Yeah.

1183
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,060
Do you eat bacon as a rule?

1184
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,740
I've been a vegetarian for six years.

1185
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,460
Damn it!

1186
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,340
What's the problem?

1187
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,780
That was my whole thing.

1188
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,420
What about like vegetable bacon?

1189
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,140
Does that exist?

1190
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,420
It does.

1191
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,940
You want this pig to be intimidated

1192
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,540
because she's eating vegetable bacon?

1193
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,660
Nothing you said made sense.

1194
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,100
Listen, I know I said it out loud.

1195
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,600
It's fine.

1196
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,620
So just to work on the phrasing of the question,

1197
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,820
you want the pig to think that you're not afraid of the pig.

1198
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,940
You didn't come to us and say,

1199
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,540
how can I stop being afraid of the pig?

1200
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,060
Because that's not even an option.

1201
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,540
This pig is a monster.

1202
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,460
This is a kaiju pig at this point.

1203
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:01,980
Basically.

1204
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,300
Have you seen the pig do anything bad or dangerous

1205
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,340
to another human being?

1206
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,740
Not to me, but occasionally she'll cry.

1207
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,100
Well, to me, yes.

1208
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,500
Are you okay?

1209
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,300
Are you okay, Charlotte?

1210
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,220
My boyfriend and his family is not afraid of her.

1212
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,540
Like if you push past her when you're going past her,

1213
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,220
she'll use, she's fine with it.

1214
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,740
She just senses my hesitation.

1215
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,500
You're putting a lot of thoughts in this pig brain.

1216
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,060
Are you sure that the pig senses your hesitation?

1217
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,220
Okay, I don't know how to convince the pig

1218
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,020
that you're not intimidated,

1219
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,980
but I do think I know a way for you to get over this.

1220
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,900
You're going to need to get like a two and a half pound pig.

1221
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,140
Walk past that confidently.

1222
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,260
You've done it.

1223
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,140
Good job.

1224
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,220
Now, like a five pound pig.

1225
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:46,780
Yes.

1226
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,820
Walk past that.

1227
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,980
You're going to end up owning a lot of pigs.

1228
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,300
Yes.

1229
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,340
This is a bit of a commitment.

1230
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,580
Yeah.

1231
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,260
It's going to be a Mr. Popper of Spenguin situation.

1232
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,060
Oh, thanks.

1233
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,100
My name is Charlotte, so I think I was always envisioning

1234
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,620
having a friend of mine.

1235
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,100
There's so many reasons why this pig should love you.

1236
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,420
You can just spin a web that says dead meat.

1237
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,620
Yeah.

1238
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,660
Get in line.

1239
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,860
Okay, Charlotte, you have to turn the pig against

1240
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,700
your boyfriend and your boyfriend's family.

1241
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
So next time you go over there,

1242
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,700
I want you to stand in front of the pig, face him and say,

1243
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
no, you won't kill this pig.

1244
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,180
That's good.

1245
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,460
Not on my watch.

1246
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,900
I won't allow it.

1247
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,860
It's a good pig.

1248
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,060
Charlotte, you could try some stuff that intimidates me.

1249
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,980
So maybe bring up sports in conversation.

1250
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,980
Bring up sports or different kinds of cars that there are.

1251
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,220
Yeah.

1252
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,740
And you could bring up those while you're talking to the pig

1253
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,980
and the pig will be, if the pig is anything like me,

1254
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,980
probably intimidated.

1255
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,380
I mean, it'd work on me.

1256
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,820
Does it help?

1257
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,180
I think it doesn't hurt.

1258
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,740
Okay, good.

1259
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,340
Let's go over here.

1260
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:57,740
Hello.

1261
00:49:59,420 --> 00:49:59,900
Hi.

1262
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,140
Hi.

1263
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,020
What's your name?

1264
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,900
I'm Adrian Cowles.

1265
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,900
Hi, Adrian Cowles.

1266
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,180
My brother and me legend.

1267
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,420
Hi, Adrian.

1268
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,140
Extremely wild.

1269
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,180
Thank you for your service.

1270
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,100
I try.

1271
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,420
I know you've read a lot of bad yahoos to bring us some of the good ones.

1272
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,780
Thank you for that.

1273
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,740
Mostly, yeah.

1274
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,500
So I sent in two.

1275
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:21,980
Yeah, which one?

1276
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
Oh, God, Adrian, that's against the rules.

1277
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,020
Go fucking sit down.

1278
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,940
No, it's about you.

1279
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,420
Of course, the one about you going to the bathroom at work.

1280
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:29,900
Yes.

1281
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,380
So I'm a teacher and I'm very, very inefficient.

1282
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,540
So thank you.

1283
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,060
Actually, I took my first day off of work ever today.

1284
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,500
It's my second year to come here.

1285
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:41,980
Shit, nice.

1286
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,700
Yeah.

1287
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,180
Okay.

1288
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,100
We need you more than those kids do.

1289
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,820
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1290
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,740
So I stay at work really late, like 7, 7.30.

1291
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,100
I left at 8.45 the other day.

1292
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,740
It's bad.

1293
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,100
And it's often just me and the custodial staff.

1294
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,420
Right.

1295
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,700
And, you know, teacher, you just have to go to the bathroom all day.

1296
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,900
That's sort of your day.

1297
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,540
Wait, wait.

1298
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,060
Finally, a job I can sink my teeth into.

1299
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,860
You don't mean, you mean you feel the desire to go to the bathroom all day,

1300
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,740
not you just go to the bathroom all day, right?

1301
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,220
Yeah.

1302
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:16,700
Okay.

1303
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,460
So like, the end of the day hits.

1304
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,740
I'm like, I got to go to the bathroom.

1305
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,540
So I'll go to the bathroom and sometimes I'll come out and make eye contact with the custodian

1306
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,340
about to go.

1307
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,100
Like, enjoy my work.

1308
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,900
Clean, yes.

1309
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah, I'll have fun doing some Zodiac killer.

1310
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,460
Have you found her walking out saying, don't worry, I did a very good job.

1311
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,660
No, no, no, no.

1312
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,860
It doesn't matter, right?

1313
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,140
It doesn't matter, right, AJ?

1314
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,420
Because if I'm understanding correctly, I know I'm getting ahead, but like, no matter

1315
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,140
how good of a job you do in there, if you're the last person they see, you're responsible

1316
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,820
for all crime in the bathroom.

1317
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,060
Yeah, it's like, do I wait until after they've cleaned it and be like, hey, I'm going to

1318
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,860
go to the bathroom.

1319
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,540
No, no, no.

1320
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,980
Nasty, nasty monster.

1321
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,420
I know that's the wrong answer.

1322
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,500
I'm just saying that's my quandary.

1323
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,500
This is a thing, this happens to me all the time because we tour a lot and we stay in

1324
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,260
hotels and every, like, I always seem to time leaving my hotel room with, as the cleaning

1325
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,780
staff is right outside my door, and I will look at them and then just put the privacy

1326
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,180
police on the handle like, you don't have to worry about it.

1327
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,660
Please, please.

1328
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,420
I'm so sorry about everything.

1329
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,580
I made coffee in there.

1330
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,620
I feel terrible.

1331
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,540
It is, the situation you described of going after is what I run into at the airport a

1332
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:35,260
lot when I am sprinting towards the restroom as I want to do, and they have the little

1333
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,900
sign up like, hold on, you can't go in here, we're doing our work, and I feel so bad in

1334
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,340
the opposite arrangement where I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to wreck it, thank you.

1335
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,820
So, there's really not a good order of operations here.

1336
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,060
Maybe you could clean the bathroom when you're done, so then when they go in, they're like,

1337
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,260
dang, and you're like, thanks, that one's on me.

1338
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,260
Could you grade these papers?

1339
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,820
It's, ideally you should do that when you do your stuff anyway.

1340
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,180
Clean the whole bathroom.

1341
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,660
Well, at least maintain your own fortress.

1342
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,540
Maybe come out and say, I used the second stall.

1343
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,780
I think you'll appreciate my thorough cleaning.

1344
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:18,780
Sign it.

1345
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,740
Yeah, if you find out an answer, will you let us know?

1346
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,220
Yeah, usually what I do is I'll go into the break room, and if he's in there, I'll just

1347
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,180
like walk to the bathroom and pretend that's why I came in and leave.

1348
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,620
Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.

1349
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,180
Just go home.

1350
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,140
I was worried you were going to use the bathroom in the break room.

1351
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,900
I was also worried about that.

1352
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,140
There's a, there's a ficus in there that I really hate.

1353
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,700
Does that help?

1354
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,180
Absolutely.

1355
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,060
Thank you, Adrian.

1356
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:46,380
Thank you.

1357
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,900
Hello, hi, my name is Matt S. Matt Ceriani.

1358
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,700
Hi Matt.

1359
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,420
Hello.

1360
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,460
What is your question?

1361
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,540
Well, I also broke the rules and put in multiple.

1362
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:00,780
Jesus, Matt, you had one about a band you might've used to be in.

1363
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,980
Oh yes.

1364
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,060
Tomorrow I'm playing a show and the band that I was in for two years and I left them

1365
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,780
by ghosting them is, is also playing that night.

1366
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,540
I'm actually opening for them.

1367
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,580
A sumptuous feast.

1368
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,740
Now, Matt, I'm so glad that you're at the microphone for this one.

1369
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,260
You've got to walk me through the timeline of how that happened

1370
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,100
because I'm worried at some point you knowingly agreed to that.

1371
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,500
Well, I think I left the band in, oh man.

1372
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,180
You ghosted them so fucking hard that you don't know you left the band?

1373
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,980
One day you just realized you weren't in it anymore.

1374
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,460
Yeah.

1375
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,780
No, that's kind of more or less how it happened.

1376
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,220
No, July I think was when I decided for myself I wasn't in the band anymore.

1377
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,740
That's so recent, Matt.

1378
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,460
I know.

1379
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,460
I just started playing music on my own.

1380
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,140
I knew it was going to happen eventually.

1381
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,820
I didn't think it was going to happen this soon.

1382
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,900
Wait, are you a solo act?

1383
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,420
Yeah, but I have a full band behind me.

1384
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,140
Oh, okay.

1385
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,020
I thought that you were just going to be there in like the dressing room area with them

1386
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,340
and they might even get confused as to why you were not also going on stage with them.

1387
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,020
And then they would be like, oh right, Matt doesn't work here anymore.

1388
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:28,060
Matt, is it a situation where they have gotten wildly, profoundly successful?

1389
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,100
Is it Coldplay?

1390
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,940
Is Coldplay the band that you left last?

1391
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,420
Fortunately for me, not.

1392
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:33,740
Okay, good.

1393
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,500
Otherwise I'd be even more embarrassed.

1394
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,220
Right, right.

1395
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,460
And then this would also be like a Machiavellian sort of plot to get revenge on.

1396
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,980
How do you feel about the fact that you are opening for them?

1397
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:50,060
I was going to say, Matt, like you left the band and now you're opening for them.

1398
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,700
I don't think you have to feel uncomfortable.

1399
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,340
Like, it seems like if I'm in that band, I'm like, teach that guy.

1400
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,820
I guess he was wrong and we were right.

1401
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,300
Hey, Matt, play all their songs.

1402
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:02,860
There we go.

1403
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,060
I could.

1404
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,180
Make them learn new shit on the spot.

1405
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:18,220
I want them to come out and be like, anyway, you put the lime in the coconut.

1406
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:19,900
Anything?

1407
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,620
Is that something?

1408
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:26,620
I'm just going to walk on stage and be like, hey, I'm a insert band's name cover band.

1409
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,220
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1410
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,460
You could also say that you're still in the band.

1411
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:35,900
You're just way, way, way, way, way, way off tempo.

1412
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:46,060
Well, you're rushing a lot by about 45 minutes.

1413
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,740
Just keep saying like, I don't know where the rest of them are.

1414
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,940
Maybe they're in the bathroom.

1415
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,980
Here's another one.

1416
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,540
Just keep getting more air and be like, this is feeling good.

1417
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,500
Let's keep rocking.

1418
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,780
I'm just going to keep this set going all night long.

1419
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,980
When they come in and say, and this is my closing act, and then walk on stage.

1420
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,540
Does that help?

1421
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,820
Absolutely.

1422
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,620
Thank you, Matt.

1423
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,060
I feel like we just dragged you for a while, but thank you for saying it helped.

1424
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:14,860
Hello.

1425
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,060
Hi.

1426
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,700
How's it going?

1427
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,420
Hey, is that a McElroy family branded fanny pack?

1428
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,620
It sure is.

1429
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,340
Wow, are those available at McElroyMerch.com?

1430
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:23,980
All right.

1431
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,140
I bet those are so convenient for carrying around, say, dice or snacks.

1432
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,740
We've already got their money.

1433
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,940
The Pepto-Bismol.

1434
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,980
Pepto-Bismol.

1435
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,940
Hey, now.

1436
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,340
We should have an official sponsorship deal with them.

1437
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,460
Does that come with them?

1438
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,100
It may as well.

1439
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,300
Anyway, hi.

1440
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,740
What's your name and question?

1441
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,660
Hi, my name is Rachel.

1442
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,380
She, her, hers.

1443
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,020
Thank you, Rachel.

1444
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,620
So I'm a server at a hibachi restaurant.

1445
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,540
I've worked there for three and a half years.

1446
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,660
And per the yuge, they do the cool onion volcano and things.

1447
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,300
A waste of an onion, according to some people.

1448
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,980
There are better ways to cook the onion.

1449
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,620
Thank you, Travis.

1450
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,140
We can't re-litigate this.

1451
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,060
I want to do cool tricks, too.

1452
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,560
Right.

1453
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,900
Please help me.

1454
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,940
But you're not a chef.

1455
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,380
Absolutely not.

1456
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,060
You're a server at the restaurant.

1457
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,780
Absolutely.

1458
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,020
Have you had training to do these things?

1459
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,540
They trained me three days and then I was on my own.

1460
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,020
Okay.

1461
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,700
Okay, but they didn't train you.

1462
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,420
Sorry, yes.

1463
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,540
I think you misunderstand.

1464
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,020
To flip things.

1465
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,740
To flip shit.

1466
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,740
They trained you just to flip things.

1467
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,260
They trained you to be a server and not spill drinks on people.

1468
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,460
Not how to, I don't know, spin a plate on your nose.

1469
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,260
Yeah.

1470
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,180
Can you go to wherever you took the training and say like,

1471
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm ready for the master course where you teach me to slide

1472
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,380
somebody's wine glass off of a sharp knife onto the table.

1473
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,580
I don't know what kind of these tricks look like.

1474
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,540
Listen, I say you got to walk before you can run.

1475
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,500
You just need to start doing the tricks.

1476
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,100
And at first you won't be good at it.

1477
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,900
None of us are.

1478
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,980
And very quickly you'll lose your job.

1479
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,780
That's fine.

1480
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,460
But then you'll get another job.

1481
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,340
And you'll do a little bit better there.

1482
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,180
And you can say, and you don't have to tell them,

1483
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,540
you can say one of my pride as a server at this place

1484
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,340
is that I never try to do any hibachi tricks.

1485
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,940
And that's never been a problem for me.

1486
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,660
And I don't expect it to be one at this facility.

1487
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,860
Fucking day one.

1488
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,740
You're just flipping shrimp into people's mouths,

1489
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,620
higgledy-piggledy.

1490
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,540
There's lots of other restaurants you could try out.

1491
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,460
You could just hand them an empty glass

1492
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,060
and you have the pitcher of water.

1493
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,340
And you say, now I'm going to stand back as far as I can

1494
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,540
and fill that glass.

1495
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,540
And then just throw the water up into the air.

1496
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,620
Or into your open mouth.

1497
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,100
Just holler when you get a powerful thirst going.

1498
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,740
Do you do that?

1499
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,220
Like, if you're the server at one of those places,

1500
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,820
can you be like, oh, you need some ketchup?

1501
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,540
No problem.

1502
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,740
Just toss it behind your back,

1503
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,620
catch it in your front.

1504
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,980
Like, add a little pizzazz.

1505
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,060
Yeah, you could do some like cocktail stuff, you know?

1506
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,860
Exactly.

1507
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,460
Some knife throwing into the table.

1508
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,780
Now, you just look horrified at that.

1509
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,220
This is your idea.

1510
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,660
We are not even, yes, ending.

1511
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,940
We're just saying, yes.

1512
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,460
You know what would be a badass trick?

1513
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,860
Turn the table all the way up on heat or whatever.

1514
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,220
And then walk up and just say,

1515
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,820
I hope you all enjoy your food tonight.

1516
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,620
Stone-faced.

1517
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,900
Put your hand right on the table.

1518
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,900
Go into the sunken, like, you don't feel it.

1519
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,580
I don't feel it.

1520
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,700
I do have one thing that usually gets people

1521
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,980
that people don't expect.

1522
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,260
So we take the order and we turn it into the chefs.

1523
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,780
We're like, here's the food.

1524
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,260
And then we go take the soups out to the table.

1525
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,780
And it's, they're hot.

1526
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,260
Like, they're-

1527
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:31,980
Like soup is.

1528
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,780
Yeah, got you.

1529
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,060
Like 98.5% of soup is.

1530
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,180
They are hot.

1531
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,420
And people see that they're steaming.

1532
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,820
And so it really annoys them that we have to say

1533
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,540
that they're hot.

1534
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,060
So when I hand them out, I take the first two

1535
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,460
and I set them to my left and I go,

1536
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,860
guys, I just want to let you know the soup is soup or hot.

1537
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,380
That's not a trick.

1538
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,500
No.

1539
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,740
It's fucking so funny, obviously.

1540
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,660
Listen, that rules.

1541
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,380
Yeah, it's very good.

1542
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:00,860
Don't get me wrong.

1543
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
But it tripped with me, like if you handed them

1544
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,740
the bowls upside down and flipped it over

1545
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,100
and it was full of soup.

1546
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,860
That's an awesome trick.

1547
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,100
Or if you said, you know what else is super hot?

1548
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:17,020
And then you put your hand on the fucking hibachi table.

1549
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,140
Or you hand them that.

1550
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,780
And at the bottom of it is a note that has their name

1551
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,620
and social security number on it.

1552
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,460
Because here's the thing.

1553
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,060
I don't know how much you can flip,

1554
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,700
but you can become a mentalist.

1555
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,340
And it's-

1556
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,260
Listen, it's not the same kind of trick.

1557
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,420
But I would say mentalism is like the hibachi of magic.

1558
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,700
Yeah, man, for sure.

1559
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,540
Does that help?

1560
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,580
It helps so much.

1561
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,140
Thank you.

1562
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:42,700
Thank you.

1563
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,220
No, thank you.

1564
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:47,740
Hello.

1565
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,100
Hi.

1566
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,100
You can angle that up if you want.

1567
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,580
No problem.

1568
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,140
Just point the microphone.

1569
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:52,940
Yeah, you got it.

1570
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,220
Hi, I'm Jake.

1571
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,020
Hi, Jake.

1572
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,660
Jake.

1573
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,700
Short while back, I requested some time off

1574
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,940
and my boss gave it to me even though I didn't have

1575
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,980
vacation time to use.

1576
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,180
It was about 5.36 in the morning after a 13-hour shift

1577
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,940
and I was very tired.

1578
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,380
And when he went to shake my hand,

1579
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,460
I panicked and I hugged him.

1580
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,860
Nice choice.

1581
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,360
Right.

1582
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,660
How do I erase this from his memory?

1583
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,160
Right.

1584
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,740
And how do I overcome my new fear of handshakes?

1585
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,240
Yeah.

1586
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,700
Yeah, I mean, you can practice that.

1587
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,780
There's some YouTube tutorials about how to land

1588
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,540
that in particular spacecraft.

1589
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,380
So this is a lot like kind of calling your teacher mommy.

1590
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:36,880
Yes.

1591
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,740
On that note, do you want to hear where it gets worse?

1592
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,240
Yeah.

1593
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,500
You called your boss mommy?

1594
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,780
No, I may have accidentally thanked him by saying

1595
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,020
thanks for getting me off those days.

1596
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,520
Jake.

1597
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,020
OK.

1598
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:50,520
All right.

1599
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,080
Cool, Jake.

1600
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,600
Cool, Jake.

1601
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,160
Cool, Jake.

1602
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,580
I am 100% not lying to you.

1603
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,080
I know.

1604
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,380
You need to leave here.

1605
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:13,260
You didn't need to clarify that you weren't lying.

1606
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,620
We knew.

1607
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,340
You can tell.

1608
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,700
I had a rather emotional little speech lined up

1609
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:30,140
about how a hug can be nice with consent

1610
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,700
and then maybe it just brought you two closer

1611
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,780
and maybe it was special.

1612
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:40,300
But then you talked about how you did kind of a jizz joke.

1613
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,420
And now I don't feel like my thing is going

1614
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,860
to cut the mustard anymore.

1615
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,580
There was definitely an avenue.

1616
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,340
I was going to ask, did he hug you back?

1617
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,660
Was it a nice moment?

1618
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,620
I do actually need to know this information.

1619
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,420
Yeah, did he hug you back?

1620
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,860
So it was kind of like an awkward side hug at first.

1621
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,220
A Christian side hug, yes.

1622
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,180
And then we shook hands over it.

1623
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,980
Oh my god.

1624
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,580
Oh no.

1625
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,860
It's the worst possible.

1626
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,620
I would have sooner you'd be stabbed in the flank

1627
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,860
with a switchblade.

1628
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,860
Did you then accidentally pull his arm off?

1629
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,900
And then you yanked out his pants.

1630
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,820
Like, what happened?

1631
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:22,220
And then your pants fell down.

1632
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,700
Holy shit, Jake.

1633
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,380
God, Jake, you fucked up so bad.

1634
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,140
OK.

1635
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,780
You should have asked us before.

1636
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,460
Or we could have done something.

1637
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,300
So my original question still holds.

1638
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,220
Did he hug you back at any point?

1639
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,820
I mean, he put one arm back around my back, too, I guess.

1640
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,860
It was the weirdest kind of like.

1641
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,340
Yeah, it was the weirdest imaginable hug.

1642
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,900
Yes, we've established.

1643
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,060
You might have actually reached a point that weren't going

1644
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,900
to him and saying, I also know how bad that was.

1645
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,780
We are past the point of joking now, Jake.

1646
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,100
I'm worried about you and this other person who

1647
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,500
both of you were in this moment.

1648
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,700
I'm filing a complaint with HR, not against you or myself,

1649
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,380
but against the moment.

1650
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,060
Yeah.

1651
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,620
Like, you should both be mad at fate and what it made you

1652
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,140
both do.

1653
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,580
For bringing you together.

1654
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,020
A lot of people talk about serendipity

1655
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,220
like it's always a good thing.

1656
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,700
Nope.

1657
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,860
Sometimes it gets you.

1658
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:32,540
Sometimes two human bodies interlock in such a way

1659
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:35,660
that it butterfly effects out and causes World War III.

1660
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,180
Have you?

1661
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,540
It's not a butterfly effect.

1662
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,580
It got you immediately.

1663
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,100
It was a bee effect.

1664
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,260
You put your hands together on top of a bee and it got you.

1665
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,740
So Jacob, where do you work now?

1666
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,700
That's actually the thing is that my job pays too much

1667
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,660
to leave, so I'm kind of stuck in this money

1668
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,020
trap and this, you know, nightmare.

1669
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,460
This seems like a question less about human intimacy

1670
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,740
and more about power dynamics, which

1671
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,940
is to say you're going to have to be the boss somehow.

1672
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,900
And then you can say, now that I'm the boss,

1673
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,780
what was up with that hug?

1674
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,380
You're fired.

1675
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,540
Jacob, you should apologize for this hug.

1676
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,100
Yes.

1677
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,460
It's not for jokes in the past.

1678
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,500
You must apologize.

1679
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,140
Unless.

1680
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:23,660
No.

1681
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,140
Jokes is left around.

1682
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,100
Jokes, get out of here.

1683
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,620
Unless.

1684
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,180
Jokes, step off the stage.

1685
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,620
Jokes, come on back up.

1686
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,740
Jokes waiting in the wings.

1687
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,900
Come on down.

1688
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,860
Can you establish this as like your secret handshake

1689
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,580
with the boss?

1690
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,700
Would you perhaps have any friends in the office

1691
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,940
that you can repeat this with in front of the boss?

1692
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,380
And the boss is like, oh, it turns out it's not weird.

1693
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,020
Yeah.

1694
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,740
Jake's just weird.

1695
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:56,180
Should we do the normal 2019 handshake for millennials

1696
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,340
and hip dads?

1697
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:02,300
Hey, jokes off the stage.

1698
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,460
You can't just hug people.

1699
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:05,580
Yes, also that, Jake.

1700
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,060
It's 2019.

1701
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,740
You have to apologize.

1702
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,620
It was an accident.

1703
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,260
It happened.

1704
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,180
You must apologize for the hug, Jacob.

1705
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,500
I would agree with Justin already

1706
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,780
if it didn't go beyond just hugging someone to invading

1707
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,100
both their space and psyche.

1708
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,180
And at this point, their privacy.

1709
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:28,980
There's 3,000 people here.

1710
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,420
Jake, do you promise you'll apologize for the hug?

1711
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:31,900
Yeah.

1712
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,620
And you are dismissed.

1713
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,220
Thank you.

1714
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:33,940
Thank you, Jake.

1715
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:37,900
That's it.

1716
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,460
All right, you can lower the house lights.

1717
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:39,940
Thank you.

1718
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,940
Once Jacob is safely nestled, I don't want him to trip.

1719
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,140
No, that would be the worst thing to ever happen to Jake.

1720
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,300
Jake, get nice and cozy.

1721
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:49,780
We'll wait.

1722
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,300
Yes, thank you.

1723
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:50,780
All right.

1724
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,020
Now, Jake, is it cozy?

1725
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:52,300
Good.

1726
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:52,900
All warmed up?

1727
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,380
You good?

1728
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,540
Like a nice, warm hug?

1729
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,340
You don't have a microphone anymore, Jake.

1730
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,940
The power's all back here.

1731
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,460
All right.

1732
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,060
If you could go ahead and turn their lights.

1733
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,060
Make Jake disappear.

1734
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,180
Make them go away.

1735
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,300
There are too many of them.

1736
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:03,620
I can't.

1737
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,140
Goodbye.

1738
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:04,660
Stop waving.

1739
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,460
You monsters.

1740
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,260
Brigadoon.

1741
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,100
Thank you so much for having us here at your beautiful theater.

1742
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:15,860
And I will also say, your beautiful town.

1743
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,820
Yes, Brooklyn.

1744
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,180
Hell of a town.

1745
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,620
Hey, if you don't have anything going on tomorrow,

1746
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,420
we're coming back.

1747
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,220
We might just sleep in the green room.

1748
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:27,940
Yeah.

1749
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,420
Doing all the same jokes.

1750
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:30,700
Jake's going to be here.

1751
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,980
It's going to be fucking lit.

1752
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,740
There's a few of you that aren't so far.

1753
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,500
And it would be cool if all of you did.

1754
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,940
Thank you.

1755
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,540
If you could just come to that show,

1756
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,180
we'd really appreciate it.

1757
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,460
Or maybe just tell a friend.

1758
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,980
Say, I went last night.

1759
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,140
It was great and not at all awkward.

1760
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:51,420
We have beautiful posters designed by Carrie Peach

1761
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,820
out in the lobby that are so, so beautiful.

1762
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,340
If you bought one or got any kind of merch on your way out,

1763
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,340
you can grab a sticker for free on your way out.

1764
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,020
They become the monster tour sticker.

1765
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,460
Yes, Paul is texting me this information as we speak.

1766
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,420
He also says not to stick them to anything in the theater.

1767
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,940
So Paul's a cop.

1768
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,260
We also want to say thank you to Sawbones for opening for us.

1769
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,340
Yeah.

1770
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,220
We got a book, too.

1771
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,300
It's called The Sawbones Book.

1772
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,340
You buy it on Amazon or maybe in the hallway.

1773
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,500
I don't know.

1774
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,260
Also, speaking of books, pre-orders for book three

1775
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,300
of The Adventure Zone, Pebbles to the Metal.

1776
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:28,780
Yes.

1777
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,740
That is available now.

1778
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,660
You can go to The Adventure.

1779
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,180
Well, the pre-order is available now.

1780
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,580
That was a bad way of phrasing it.

1781
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

1782
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,380
and pre-order it now.

1783
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,860
It will be out in July.

1784
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,780
But why wait?

1785
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,700
Yeah.

1786
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,740
And go to our YouTube channel.

1787
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,580
We announced the new season of Adventure Zone today

1788
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,620
that Travis is running.

1789
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,380
It's very exciting.

1790
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,700
It's a really cool trailer, and you'll like it.

1791
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,380
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1792
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,380
for the use of a theme song.

1793
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,620
It's a departure off the album, Playing the Days to Bed.

1794
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:01,900
We have a whole trek back down to, like, I don't know.

1795
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,060
We're staying in downtown, and we're doing this show here

1796
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,460
because we're bad at planning.

1797
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,820
So we won't be able to hang out.

1798
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,220
We're very good at planning.

1799
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,260
We designed it this way.

1800
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,540
We're staying in a building where they do Tootsie, all right?

1801
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,940
We're staying in the middle of the city.

1802
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,300
We're staying in the building.

1803
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:14,980
This is not a joke.

1804
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,300
We're staying in the building where

1805
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,940
we did the blue carpet premiere of Margaritaville.

1806
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,900
We have to see.

1807
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,780
We have to still chalk outlines of everything.

1808
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,460
Right.

1809
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,460
So we won't be able to hang out of this show.

1810
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,620
But we'll be here tomorrow.

1811
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:30,100
It's cool.

1812
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,300
Just come see us tomorrow.

1813
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,140
Tomorrow's like the after party of this show.

1814
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,980
Right.

1815
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1816
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:41,420
Thank you, Adrian, wherever you are.

1817
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,500
It's from Yahoo Answers user Crisp Kringle, who asks,

1818
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,100
does Subway have secret bologna?

1819
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,820
My name is Justin McElroy.

1820
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,580
I'm Travis McElroy.

1821
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1822
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,740
It's been my brother, my brother, me,

1823
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,500
kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1824
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:16,780
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

1825
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,540
Maximumfun.org.

1826
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,940
Comedy and culture.

1827
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,100
Artist-owned.

1828
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,020
Audience-supported.

1829
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,780
Hey, I'm Janet Varney.

1830
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,100
And like many of you, some more recent than others,

1831
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,100
I used to be a teenager.

1832
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,740
In fact, just about all of my friends

1833
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,700
were, too, including wonderful women like Alison Brie.

1834
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,820
I'm dead center on the balance beam.

1835
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,500
And this is like a big gym.

1836
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,060
All the kids' parents are there watching.

1837
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,100
I have to stop, like when you have to pee so bad

1838
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,060
and you can't even move.

1839
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,460
And then I just go.

1840
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:51,100
I just pee right in the middle of the high balance beam.

1841
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,660
So join me every week on the JV Club podcast,

1842
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,900
where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans

1843
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,660
as we reminisce about our adolescences

1844
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,380
and how they led us to becoming who we are.

1845
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:27,540
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.
