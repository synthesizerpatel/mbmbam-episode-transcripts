1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello friends, welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, and we are California bound. California!

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:04,480
California! Here we come! A natural phantom planet soprano.

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Travis, when you said you were going to get a castration for this episode,

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,200
I doubted you, and now I am completely and utterly doubting you.

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
That's fair, I had it reversed.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,880
I don't think you can transplant that particular gland.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,200
I did, and then I had it put back.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
Right, that's what a transplant is, and I don't- I'm saying that that's not-

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,160
It wasn't really a transplant because I didn't have it switched out with anything.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
It was more just like a brief hiatus.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,680
I don't- but again, I don't think you can pause the existence of your dong- of your donger.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,080
I want to give some free advice to people about packing.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,080
This is starting the advice earlier than we normally do, but you should-

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,880
The first thing you pack should be the last thing you'd want to ask someone at the front desk for,

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,600
and in my case, that's always Preparation H.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,920
That's the number one thing that I always pack first to make sure it's in there.

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,320
Justin's luggage could be characterized by the number of shame cubbies built into it.

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Oh man, it's secrets upon secrets upon secrets.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,760
It's like, you know that movie Heavy Weights when they're like,

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,880
all right, let me check your bunk for food, and he checks the bunk for food,

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,200
and they're like, no food here, and they leave, and then these fat fucks pull lifesavers and

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
gummy candies and snacky treats out of every orifice of their luggage and their beds and

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
the furniture in the room.

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
That's pretty much-

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
Mine's like that, but for anal treatments.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
My suitcase is like the life of Gary Glitter.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
It's just- just when you think there's not another place for embarrassment to hide, there it is.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Man, you make a lot of references to that person that few people know who they are.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
That's right.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Everybody knows who Gary Glitter is.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,920
Come on.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:51,920
No.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,440
Come on.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,080
Probably not.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
Are you guys psyched to go to the left coast?

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,520
I am.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,160
I'm ready.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm not looking for that time change, though.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,640
Well, actually, I was listening to Stuff You Should Know, and they were talking about jet lag,

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,280
and basically what you gotta do is, as you're flying over the country,

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
you gotta stab yourself in the leg.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't think you were listening right.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,280
No, you stab yourself in the leg, and then the pain distracts your brain from the time change.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so then you get there, and it's still three hours earlier.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
Yeah, but like, you're bleeding.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,880
You're frequently blacking out, and that helps with the sleep deprivation.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,200
Yes, that's true.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Listen, this comes straight from Chuck and Josh, and they travel a lot.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
I think it comes like fourth hand through Chuck and Josh.

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,600
No, no, no, it's what they said.

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Travis, I'm gonna look in Chuck's face within the next five days,

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
and I will ask him if you're lying to me.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,880
Now, he may not remember it, because it was from a secret bonus episode

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,520
that they beamed directly into my brain while I was sleeping.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,760
Okay.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,760
Is that how you found out about 9-11 being an inside job also?

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Yep, from Chuck and Josh.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
Well, brain Chuck and Josh.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Did you guys introduce yourselves?

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm the only non-delusional person other than Justin on this podcast.

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,840
And I'm Travis McElroy.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
The end.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Period.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
Period.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm in high school frequently.

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm complimented on my appearance while wearing formal wear.

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,680
We get it.

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
Suit, tuxedo.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:36,640
However, the call to wear nice clothing is limited.

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,480
How can I dress nice more frequently so as to appease my vanity without being a dick about it?

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,840
Is there even a way to dress nice on a normal day without giving someone the douche chills?

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,920
Or do I have to become that weirdo who always wears dress shirts?

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
And that's from Gmail.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,960
This is...

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh, God.

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
I mean, there is, but not in fucking high school, for sure.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Yeah, that's the thing.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,360
Like, I have a friend, my friend Jeremy, he dresses nice every day.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
He's also a goddamn adult.

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah, that's the thing.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,040
And so, like, he's like, oh, that's a well-put-together dude.

89
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,240
Not like a 15-year-old who's getting above his raisin.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Even in college.

91
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,480
College is really, like, a $15,000 a year reason to wear sweatpants all the time.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,480
And, like, when you raise the bar by, you know, slapping some suspenders on...

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,640
And I'm gonna be...

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm gonna be straight with you.

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
Here's some harsh truth, because I know this.

96
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,760
When I work in the shop, right, and I'm usually wearing, like, my grungy paint jeans,

97
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
and that's what everybody sees me in every day,

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,560
then on the days when, like, we're opening a new show and I dress up,

99
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
yeah, I get a lot of compliments.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Because the unspoken thing is, you look better than normal.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,520
That's why you're getting...

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
Oh my god, you clean up nice, right?

103
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,640
The number of pretty woman switcheroos you are capable...

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,240
The number of she's all that alterations you can swing when you're fancy all the time,

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
every time, is zero.

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,360
Because everybody expects...

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,640
So if you're fancy all the time, no one's gonna compliment you.

108
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,320
When you're fancy 90% of the time, that one day where you do just want to throw on some cargo shorts,

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
you're gonna do a reverse she's all that.

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,760
Oh, she's not that.

111
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,080
She isn't anything, is what you're gonna pull.

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
Nowhere near the idea of that.

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
It's like that...

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Who's that broad with the glasses?

115
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh man, it's her?

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
Who knew an uggle was under all that attractiveness all the time?

117
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,920
She used to be so fit.

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
What happened?

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
It's just the glasses, but...

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
Are those pencils in her hair?

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,080
Ew.

122
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,360
No, thanks.

123
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
Ew.

124
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, the problem with dressing like that in high school is that everyone is gonna assume

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
that your mom dressed you like that.

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,320
They're gonna assume your mom...

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Well, I don't know.

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,240
Here's the thing.

129
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,760
I think there's a casual dress.

130
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I think that there are button up shirts that aren't dress shirts that you can wear with jeans

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,280
and be well put together and take care of yourself without going full suit and tie every day.

132
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,840
Yeah.

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,200
He's on that suit and tie shit.

134
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,560
Here's the thing though.

135
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,760
Because I'm speaking from my experience of when I was in high school in 1982,

136
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
the game has changed, I bet.

137
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
Because do you guys know about swag?

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah.

139
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I have a passing familiarity.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Okay.

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,400
I think that this might be a swag thing.

142
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,920
I think this might be a swag.

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Because this kid, I bet, if he rolls up in high school with his suit and tie shit...

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,280
Because Justin Timberlake just did that song about it, so kids know that.

145
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Kids love his music.

146
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,200
You roll up to school in your prom best.

147
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,560
I think that people...

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
I think you're gonna turn some heads and in a good way nowadays.

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
Wait, I have an idea.

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,200
Okay.

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Okay.

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,480
And this will help protect you from wearing it out because you dress nice every day and losing

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,680
the effectiveness and simultaneously keep it interesting for all your friends.

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
Bring your suit and tie with you.

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,240
Keep it at school.

156
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
And then just change for one period out of every day and then change back.

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,320
You know, baby, it's social studies.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
I gotta look my best.

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,320
And when they're like, wait, hold on.

160
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
And you're like, excuse me, what?

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,760
No, I've been wearing jeans and t-shirt all day.

162
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,160
This is, again, I feel like we have to return to an old classic rule here.

163
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,280
None of our advice is applicable if you are hugely physically attractive.

164
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,680
Yes.

165
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,360
Because, again, if you're really physically just very, very pleasing to the eye,

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
you can wear a suit and basically just run the school.

167
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I mean, you'll basically be running the school.

168
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,680
Ooh, watch out for the catch me if you can effect, though,

169
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,360
where everyone thinks you're a substitute teacher.

170
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
When you say watch out, you mean try as hard as you possibly can to emulate, right?

171
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,560
Yes.

172
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,480
Because I don't remember a lot about that movie,

173
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
but I do remember that he got copious amounts of trim.

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
There was that.

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
Nigh on offensive amounts of trim.

176
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
That was the 60s, though.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
That's all right.

178
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
All you had to do was put on a fucking pilot hat, and it was trim central.

179
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,520
You could go to a cheap Halloween dime store

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
and then get the requisite materials to make a trim volcano.

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
Oh, God, why were we born when we were born?

182
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,360
I know.

183
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
Back then, if you didn't wear a suit to school, you got beat up.

184
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,760
Exactly.

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah, I don't think you can.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040
And also, you know what, I'm not sure that's going to be pretty high budget

187
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
to like the way you look, I guarantee it, every day,

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,560
and still have a wide variety of looks to where it's not like

189
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
that kid is poor but in a really weird way where his parents bought him one suit.

190
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
Oh, you don't want it to be an affectation.

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
We're like, that's the guy that wears that tuxedo every day.

192
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
It has to be an affectation, though.

193
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
I mean, clothing is all about appropriateness, right?

194
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,600
You can dress up or not as the situation demands.

195
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,200
This is why we say on invitations like casual or Jimmy Buffett inspired or formal.

196
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
Nobody has ever—

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
Jimmy Buffett has never invited people to a Jimmy Buffett.

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,840
Jimmy Buffett is metacognizant of how bad his shit is.

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Wouldn't it be a real mindfuck, though,

200
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
if it turned out that Jimmy Buffett's style was full black tie affair?

201
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
And you got there and your parrot shirt and everything,

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,520
and I was like, you misread it and it actually said Warren Buffett.

203
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
God damn it.

204
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,120
Did it again.

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
How about another question?

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
You guys want to help another person?

207
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Do you want to Yahoo?

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
Because I got actually like a shit ton.

209
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,440
People came in.

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,960
I know I had to fucking read through all of them.

211
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,360
People responded in full fucking force.

212
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Thank you to everybody.

213
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm probably going to be dipping into this week's stash for a while, so thank you all.

214
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Let's kick things off.

215
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
This one was sent in actually by two people, by Andrew Jones and Oliver Hill.

216
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Thank you, guys.

217
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,840
It's by Yahoo!

218
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Insta's user, Turd, who asks.

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
You're done.

220
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
That's it.

221
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
Who asks, how can I get my dad to be cool?

222
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,000
He's a really shy, nerdy guy.

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,080
He's like 50, so can he really change?

224
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
My mom walks all over him, and it makes me sad to see that my father is not a real man.

225
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes, he's a responsible man and a kind man, but not a real man.

226
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,040
I want to teach him how to be cool and not so uptight.

227
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,680
He needs to start hitting the gym, going out to socialize,

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
and maybe pick up a fun hobby like pool hustling or joining a motorcycle gang.

229
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480
Oh, my God.

230
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,000
50?

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Any too late to just fucking switch it and change it?

232
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,560
We're talking about a dad's all that, right?

233
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Dad, take those glasses off.

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh, shit.

235
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,920
You're a stigmatism.

236
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,800
I forgot.

237
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Hey, Dad, get off that riding lawn mower.

238
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Can't buy me, Dad.

239
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,720
Come on.

240
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
Let me clean you right up.

241
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, my goodness.

242
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,440
Hey, Dad of the Year, was that the Rick Moranis movie?

243
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
What was the Rick Moranis movie?

244
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,880
That was Honey, I Shrunk the Dad.

245
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
Shrunk the Kid.

246
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
No, it was Honey, I Shrunk My Swag.

247
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
Honey, I Blew Up My Swag.

248
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
How can you get your 50-year-old...

249
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,880
Well, first of all, you're going to have to have a frank conversation with him.

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
With your dad, Frank.

251
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
If your dad's name is Frank, it helps to say,

252
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
listen, you have raised me.

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
You're kind and you're responsible.

254
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,080
I know my mom's walks all over you, but I respect what you've done for me and my family.

255
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,920
But fuck you are lame.

256
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Manzos, you just...

257
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,720
Man, I look at you and it's just...

258
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,080
You're just a pitiful husk of negative manliness.

259
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,960
The stork has not been kind enough to bless me with a baby from the cabbage patch, but I am 32.

260
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,360
Right.

261
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
So I would...

262
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't address something for you.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,480
But I can tell you, your dad is 100% aware at every waking moment how uncool he has become.

264
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,160
This is not a wake up one day and you have those socks with...

265
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,200
You have argyle socks on.

266
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:06,480
This is a slow descent from relevance that started like in his late 20s and just kind of got...

267
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
Maybe, but maybe he's in full...

268
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
I would bet statistically though, at some point, he was probably cool.

269
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,880
That's the thing.

270
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
He might be still...

271
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
He might be in full blown dad denial.

272
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
He might be in dad Nile.

273
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
He might be like the biggest...

274
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Dad Nile is just not a river in Egypt.

275
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
I know, it's not...

276
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,120
It's not at all.

277
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
It's not dad at all.

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,840
He might be like a big parrot head and that might be like a mainstay from his youth.

279
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,440
And he might just think like, I fucking get it.

280
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,520
The world is moving in the wrong direction and that direction is away from Jimmy Buffett's relevance.

281
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,080
I am still on the fucking cutting, bleeding edge.

282
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,480
Is this gonna be a Buffett full episode?

283
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Maybe.

284
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
It's his birthday.

285
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,540
What?

286
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,280
Do you know what I mean?

287
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,800
There are those dads out there that are like, oh yeah, man.

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
I saw the Eagles three times last year and it fucking changed.

289
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
Like, that's not...

290
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
That is literally only your definition of cool.

291
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
Even the Eagles don't think that that's cool.

292
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,840
The Eagles know better.

293
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
The Eagles are like, here's the thing.

294
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,360
We need to talk about your Eagles consumption, the Eagles said to the Eagles fan.

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
The other side of this coin is so much more embarrassing

296
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,480
that if you had a dad who suddenly just rolled up one day in full on like leather outfit

297
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,920
and biker gear and like we ride in the motorcycle and he was like,

298
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
hey kids, let's go check out the concert scene.

299
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,400
Like, hey kids, does anybody here like Drake?

300
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,480
And then he fans out some Drake tickets.

301
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,960
Yeah, you're not gonna be more proud of him.

302
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
I would actually, that would be...

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
That would be pretty fucking great.

304
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,840
If my dad rode his motorcycle from Ironton, Ohio to Austin, Texas

305
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,280
and then fanned out a fucking fistful of Drake tickets.

306
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,240
I don't even, I don't know a single Drake song, but I would say yes.

307
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
And I would hop on the back of that Harley and we would go have the best time of our life.

308
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
Right in the sunset.

309
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:07,680
But your dad has to let his swag go for his children to become,

310
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
I mean, the universe has a finite amount of swag.

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
Everybody knows this, that's in the secret,

312
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,240
but he has to let some of it go for you to become as fresh as you can be in your life.

313
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,200
He regurgitated his swag into your open baby mouths when you were born.

314
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,320
And that is, and that's how you got the swag that you have.

315
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,880
He transferred it to you like some sort of Highlander, but also a mama bird.

316
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,440
Kind of makes it up there.

317
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,520
So the best thing you can do in your life then is to live your life

318
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,160
as cool as possible as a tribute to him.

319
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
To your dad's fallen swag?

320
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Mm-hmm.

321
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,840
You're gonna pick it up and take his mantle?

322
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,560
And when you win the swag awards that I assume Spike TV probably gives out,

323
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,720
then you can stand on stage and say, this swag's for you, dad.

324
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,080
And your dad's in the audience like,

325
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,560
Mm, cool, thanks, son.

326
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
And he pulls out a calculator.

327
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,280
Why do you have a fucking calculator with the swag awards?

328
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,080
Because you won the swag awards.

329
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,000
Your dad has just fully become Booger for Revenge of the Nexus.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,040
Oh, God.

331
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,840
But wait a second, who's sitting next to him at the swag awards?

332
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
It's Drake.

333
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Drake sees him.

334
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
He's like, I'm changing my whole look.

335
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
Goes full Booger.

336
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,640
All of a sudden, your dad becomes the definition of swag.

337
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
Ouroboros.

338
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,880
Wait, what's so good?

339
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Does your swag begin to drain away as his swag increases?

340
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,760
Is it inversely proportional?

341
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,000
It's the swag of Dorian Gray.

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
You're just putting your swag into a painting.

343
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,800
Somewhere there's a painting of my dad getting less swag.

344
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
Is our dad swag, do you think?

345
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,040
Oh, yeah.

346
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah, I think he's still pretty...

347
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,960
I mean, he's got a pretty big collection of hero clicks.

348
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh, yeah.

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,120
I think he's got...

350
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
I mean, he's got a great office.

351
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
He's got a cool look.

352
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
He's got Twitter.

353
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,720
He's on that game.

354
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
He's good on Twitter, guys.

355
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
Yeah,.kerm, if you don't follow him, D-O-C-C-U-R-M.

356
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
Follow our dad.

357
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Follow our dad.

358
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,960
He'll teach you.

359
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
Now we got to charge him for that.

360
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
He's really good at...

361
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,160
He does a YouTube instructional video series on fancy basketball dribbles you can do.

362
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,800
He doesn't.

363
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,040
He has a whole series about sweet ways to roll blunts.

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,640
He'll roll specialty blunts like that.

365
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,280
He has a whole thing where he does the a cappella versions of a cappella songs.

366
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,000
It's really weird.

367
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
He harmonizes with himself in video editing.

368
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,760
It's pretty weird.

369
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
He's got a whole thing, a whole scene going on.

370
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
I want to throw out two special thanks this week.

371
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:40,960
Okay.

372
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,520
To Libby Sanders and Ben Masick, because both of them sent in farm wisdom.

373
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,480
Oh, shit.

374
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,200
Share that with us.

375
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,840
Yeah.

376
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Libby Sanders sent me some pictures of cows and baby birds and stuff, which is awesome.

377
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,080
Is that wisdom?

378
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,040
Well, she also said that apparently roosters fucking crow all day long.

379
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
Okay, so the myth is...

380
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Not just in the morning.

381
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,160
Okay, that's bullshit.

382
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
Why would anybody want that bird?

383
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,680
It's like an alarm you can't turn off.

384
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,160
I know.

385
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,720
I know.

386
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,800
Here's some farm secrets from Ben.

387
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,760
Cows lay down right before it's about to rain.

388
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,000
And I want to get some proof on this, but if you bail hay when it's wet,

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,920
don't stack it in the loft because it can set fire to the barn.

390
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,160
How?

391
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,200
What?

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't know.

393
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,200
That doesn't make sense.

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
Farm wisdom is crazy.

395
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,680
And then he sent me a picture of a cow, which I appreciate.

396
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
We did specifically ask for that.

397
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
I really like pictures of cows.

398
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Yeah.

399
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
But not when they're like on Google image search already, because like,

400
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't want a picture of a cow that a bunch of people have already looked at.

401
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Oh, also Jordan Brown sent in some pictures of cows and farm wisdoms and such,

402
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
and I appreciate it.

403
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,320
But are these like...

404
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,960
Thank you, Jordan.

405
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
Are these like original JPEGs that they themselves captured?

406
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,960
These are pictures they took of their farms.

407
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,120
Okay.

408
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm going to have to, for now on, ask farmers that write in to please

409
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,160
write NBNBAM on your cow so we know that your image is legit.

410
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
And like today's date.

411
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
I just recently started dating a wonderful girl.

412
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,240
A wonderful girl.

413
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
She's two and I'm two also.

414
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,240
I love girls.

415
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,760
I loved him.

416
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Her cooties are so cute.

417
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,320
I have a small issue though.

418
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,560
She's a professional wrestler, like the powerbomb to a table kind of wrestler,

419
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,120
which don't get me wrong, that's freaking awesome.

420
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
But it comes with a slight side effect.

421
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
She loves play fighting.

422
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Now, I like to play fight.

423
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,920
But the problem is sometimes she gets a little too into it,

424
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,480
and she starts to hit a bit hard on occasion.

425
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
Play fighting is fun, but getting punched in the gut is not.

426
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Help, brothers.

427
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
How do I get my punch love girlfriend to pull her punches?

428
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,240
That's from Gmail.

429
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Oh, honey, please don't bring your work home.

430
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,480
Time is for us.

431
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,960
Leave it at the office.

432
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
How about you tell that, like...

433
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
Which doesn't just go, ow.

434
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
Or just go, hey, don't fucking punch me.

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,800
It's a pretty good way to stop people from punching.

436
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,960
Hey, if you would stop fucking pun-

437
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
Like, I get it.

438
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,560
You're play fighting, but are you?

439
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,520
Is it play for her?

440
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,800
Or is it-

441
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,280
No, it's work.

442
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,080
She's on the clock.

443
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,360
It's either training or it's subtle psychosexual dominance

444
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,560
that she is putting in there, putting in your relationship.

445
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
Here's the problem, Punchy.

446
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,920
Your problem is you should have said something the first time she did it.

447
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,320
Because now when you bring it up, she's going to feel bad.

448
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
She's going to be like, I've been punching you for six months.

449
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Why didn't you say anything?

450
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,960
I get it.

451
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
But like, we got to take gender out of this equation.

452
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,400
We got to be gender blind on this one.

453
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,800
I agree.

454
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
I feel like hitting isn't the right answer.

455
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
Hitting's not good.

456
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
Use your words.

457
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,760
Unless you are getting paid for it, which apparently she is doing.

458
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,880
Yeah, you know, you're getting some professional hits.

459
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
You're getting it.

460
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320
I mean, people pay big money to see her hit people like that.

461
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
I mean, you're getting it all for free.

462
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
Maybe you should be a little more grateful.

463
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,600
It just seems very, this seems like a really dangerous, I mean, obviously like-

464
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
It's how fucking Houdini died.

465
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,400
Yes.

466
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,120
Thank you, Griffin.

467
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,800
That's absolutely true.

468
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,240
You know what I mean?

469
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,600
This guy might be the fucking escape artist extraordinaire of our time.

470
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
And we'll never know.

471
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
His girlfriend punches his liver to death.

472
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,040
God, this makes me upset.

473
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
Don't punch anyone.

474
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,440
Hey, everybody, even in play, don't punch anyone.

475
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,040
I don't know what else to say about it.

476
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,560
Just tell her that it hurts and that like, get that like male ego bullshit.

477
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,200
Like if this is legitimately an issue that is driving a wedge between you,

478
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,240
that the punches she does to your tummy hurts your tummy and it makes you sad,

479
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
just say all those words to her.

480
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,120
That is specifically all those words I just said.

481
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
Hey, hon.

482
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,040
Hey, please don't hit me.

483
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,520
It hurts.

484
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,040
In the tummy, it makes it sad.

485
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,080
It makes it-

486
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,160
I gotta think, I think that maybe you have to do away

487
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
with this whole part of your relationship.

488
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,720
The whole play fighting thing.

489
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
I think you have to probably let that go.

490
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Is it possible?

491
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I don't want to, I don't want to play psychologist,

492
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,040
but is it possible that like she as a person has like physical issues

493
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,680
where like that's just, she's, that's how she displays-

494
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,200
I, well, maybe the issue-

495
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
You're saying, you're saying she's a caveman is your-

496
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
Well, I'm saying that maybe like, maybe it's not,

497
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,120
we're looking at it as like her violence is stemming from her profession,

498
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
but maybe it's the other way around.

499
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,680
Maybe she picked a profession that allowed her an outlet for like her physical nature.

500
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,720
Maybe the issue is that she's fully ripped up fucking biodiesel.

501
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,240
Uh-huh.

502
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,400
And because of that, it makes her happy to express her desality

503
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,040
by going full blown beast mode on her boyfriend's tummy tom.

504
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,040
That's exactly what I was saying.

505
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,080
Thank you for translating.

506
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
Well, just say it in like fucking human speak next time.

507
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,400
Fair enough.

508
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
Why don't you put the fucking those little glasses

509
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
that only cover the bridge of your nose away

510
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
and pull out your fucking ZZ Top Shades.

511
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
How will I read my spreadsheets?

512
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,720
Right, that's what I'm saying.

513
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
This is a spreadsheet free podcast.

514
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,760
You gotta give the people the common, the common words.

515
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,520
Fair enough.

516
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,840
Like fuck.

517
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,080
All of my words will come from common from now on.

518
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Okay, good.

519
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,160
In middle school, dad told us that if you punch a bully

520
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,680
just once really hard in the nose, like a shark,

521
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
that that's usually enough.

522
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,560
So I don't think you should do that.

523
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,240
Because I think that's a that one's that that dog don't hunt.

524
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,000
I think I would not suggest that.

525
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,160
Oh, maybe when like she punches you,

526
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
you give her a glass of punch

527
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,920
and you pretend like you didn't understand

528
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,120
the parameters of the game.

529
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Okay, that's fun.

530
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,720
Except I'm worried if she's like a big punch fan,

531
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
you are building up possibly what may be

532
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,480
what may go down in APA history

533
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,040
as the most unhealthy Pavlovian response.

534
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,520
She may start seeing you as some sort of juice vending machine

535
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
with one giant punchable button,

536
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,640
which is like how Fonzie always punched

537
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
that the jukebox to get music.

538
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,520
Precisely, precisely.

539
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,760
Don't punch people anymore.

540
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,600
Don't just stop punching people.

541
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
Hey, here's a relevant question.

542
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,040
My name is Chris Brown.

543
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,080
How do I get people to stop making Rihanna jokes?

544
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,160
Concerned celebrity copycat in Chicago.

545
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah, there's an easy answer.

546
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,080
Yeah, get in a fucking cryo chamber and wait 30 years.

547
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,000
Either of those fucking people are fake.

548
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,640
You're in debt.

549
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
Well, I was going to say that when they say,

550
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,200
hey, you just like go out to me.

551
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,240
Go, Shh, I'm trying to stay under the radar

552
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,760
and then run away.

553
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
I mean, I don't think you know who Chris Brown.

554
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,760
I don't think you do.

555
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
No, I do, so it's like you're pretending

556
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
like you've had cosmetic surgery,

557
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,560
but you refuse to change your name

558
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,000
because you're really proud of your name.

559
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
Chris Brown is like the worst person

560
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
at being incognito ever.

561
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
What if he changed his name

562
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
and they were like, hey, Chris.

563
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,360
And he's like, oh, I'm not Chris Brown anymore.

564
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
I had to change my name because of all the Rihanna stuff.

565
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,720
You can call me OJ Simpson from now on.

566
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,040
Like, you changed your code, OJ Simpson?

567
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,040
You're like, yeah, because I love this.

568
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
I just picked it at random.

569
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
I love the Simpsons and orange juice

570
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
is like my favorite beverage.

571
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,040
And so I just thought like, why not?

572
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,080
You know, good on good.

573
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
It's like chocolate and peanut butter.

574
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,080
It's kind of not, though, like that.

575
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
It's not in any way like that.

576
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:55,120
Let's go to the Monday.

577
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
I want to tell you guys about a new podcast

578
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,560
that I am learning about

579
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,440
called the Optimism Club podcast.

580
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
Now, you guys know Steve and Andy, of course.

581
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,040
And Steve Buscemi and Andy Buscemi.

582
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,520
Circus.

583
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
Steve and Andy Buscemi.

584
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,920
Andy Buscemi is the failed clone of Steve Buscemi.

585
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,080
He's the unattractive Buscemi brother.

586
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
Which is really unfortunate

587
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,720
because Steve Buscemi already looks like

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,160
a failed clone of somebody else.

589
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,840
He's a failed clone of Steve Goomba.

590
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,800
It's a whole other one.

591
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,200
They do a podcast that covers everything.

592
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
You like comedy, video games, movies, comic books,

593
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
comedy books, video comics.

594
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
They got it all on there.

595
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
And they talk about it every week.

596
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
They've talked about Batman.

597
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
They've talked about The Walking Dead.

598
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
And the host's favorite podcast.

599
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,280
Hopefully there's only one that comes up in that discussion.

600
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
And there's an intro and outro by Bob Ball,

601
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
just like our show.

602
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,160
So that's trademark infringement.

603
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,920
And I expect the check is in the mail.

604
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,240
So go search for the Optimism Club podcast

605
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
and listen to it, you fools.

606
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,560
I like this.

607
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,320
I will listen to this podcast.

608
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,440
I'm sick of podcasts that just talk about

609
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,040
how awful everything is.

610
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,400
Because it's a wonderful world we live in.

611
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,440
It is.

612
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
I'm happy someone's finally acknowledging that.

613
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,040
Speaking of a wonderful world,

614
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,520
it's a great world we live in where you can buy

615
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,360
all the dicks you could ever want or need

616
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,400
on the internet in a discreet package

617
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,280
on ExtremeRestraints.com.

618
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
Fantastic, Griffin.

619
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,960
Now, is this the same site where I can get

620
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
some bedroom bondage?

621
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
Like the under the bed restraint system?

622
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
Which I was disappointed to find out

623
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
was a restraint system that went under the bed

624
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
and not something to lock someone

625
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
hanging underneath your bed.

626
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,760
Or some way to ensnare the monster.

627
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,200
Some way to tie up that monster so you can fuck it.

628
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
So you can fuck it real good.

629
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,760
I'm gonna fuck that monster on your bed.

630
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,560
That would be a good way to assuage your child's fears.

631
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,360
There's someone under the bed.

632
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
It's the boogie man, don't worry about this.

633
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,520
Is there?

634
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,080
Let me get out the-

635
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,360
We'll be like 10 minutes alone in here.

636
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Let me get out the fucking, the trap.

637
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,080
Let me get out the fucking proton pack.

638
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,160
Zip zap.

639
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,840
You can get 200 feet of bondage rope

640
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
on this site for $55.

641
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
Which seems like a steal.

642
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
I just think 200 feet of rope would be awesome.

643
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,320
Can I turn my office into the room

644
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,560
of like some sort of safari hunter?

645
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
But instead of having like a zebra head

646
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,280
and a lion head perched on the wall,

647
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,720
just like a bunch of dicks.

648
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,760
And then people would be like,

649
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,880
what are those dicks from?

650
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,040
And I can say it's from the animals I've hunted.

651
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,680
As a carpenter, the trick is you gotta find

652
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
the studs in the wall.

653
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,920
Or else all those dicks are just gonna fall off.

654
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,840
Yeah, that would be miserable.

655
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
Cause then people would be like,

656
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,000
why are all your dicks on the floor?

657
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,920
And I'll say, I'm so ashamed.

658
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,720
It's a dirty room.

659
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
But I know what you're thinking.

660
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,280
How can I keep up, you know, that level of decoration

661
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,560
and not go to the poor house?

662
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,840
The good news is that if you use the coupon code swordfish-

663
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,640
The longest running, hack this one.

664
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
This is not a good password.

665
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,480
It's unfortunate cause we picked something

666
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,600
that was unhackable.

667
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,200
I know, maybe we should start putting like zeros

668
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
and do some fucking cryptography on this bitch.

669
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,600
That's gonna get you a 20% off.

670
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
And swordfish with like a one instead of an I.

671
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,600
Ah fuck, I ruined it, I said it.

672
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
That's gonna get you 20% off on the website

673
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,360
so you can buy one fifth as many dicks.

674
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
Do you guys know any wind talkers?

675
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,280
We gotta do our next password

676
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,240
in like a mix of like Navajo and binary.

677
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,400
Extreme machines.com is the website.

678
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,240
You can start that with an E or an X and it still works,

679
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,600
which is nice.

680
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,040
They got both of those locked down.

681
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,960
They got everything, medical fetish, floggers and whips,

682
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,200
and you can save it all 20% off with the coupon code swordfish.

683
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,440
Thank you.

684
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
They are truly wonderful people who have supported us

685
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,040
for so stupid long.

686
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,840
It's awesome.

687
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,280
Huge supporters of the show,

688
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,440
and we couldn't be happier to have them still supporting us.

689
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,320
No one is more responsible for bringing this show

690
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
to you every week,

691
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,920
including the people on this call, the extremestrings.com.

692
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,120
So make sure you go there and support their wonderful website.

693
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Hi, I'm homosexual Brian Stoppe.

694
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
And I'm feminasty Erin Gibson,

695
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
and we host Throwing Shade.

696
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,920
Where we take a weekly look at all the issues important to ladies.

697
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,480
And gays.

698
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
And treat them with much less respect than they deserve.

699
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,240
It's for gay people.

700
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,360
It's for straight people.

701
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,240
It's for ladies.

702
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,960
It's for people who love to laugh, who love comedy,

703
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
and love tragedy and love crime.

704
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
And who hate drinking and driving because that's messed up.

705
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,400
Don't text.

706
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,520

Do you guys want a Yahoo?

709
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,760
I'd love one.

710
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,880
This one was sent by Alan Black.

711
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Thanks Alan Black.

712
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,880
It's by Yahoo.

713
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
We haven't seen Alan Black in a while.

714
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
Well, I mean, he does a lot of chops.

715
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
If you guys haven't been on the forums lately,

716
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Alan Black is frequently dropping chops on there.

717
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,720
Photo chops.

718
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,320
They're all really good.

719
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
Are those the forums at maximumfun.org?

720
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,160
Yes, those are the one and the same.

721
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,840
Yahoo was asked by Kingmaster1, who asks,

722
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,400
Is there a cursed sword?

723
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,520
I'm reposting this because no one helped me on the first one.

724
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,560
Is there a place in Japan where I could buy a cursed sword?

725
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Real answers only, please no sarcasm.

726
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
There is.

727
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,880
There is.

728
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,480
But you're going to have to fight your way there.

729
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,840
And then it is not worth it because that curse,

730
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
it just kind of makes you feel like you need to go to the bathroom all the time.

731
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
But when you get there, nothing happens.

732
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,000
So the curse is IBS because I've already got that particular...

733
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Every sword is cursed for me in this scenario.

734
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,040
That's why I'm saying the cost benefit analysis is not very high.

735
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,280
Okay.

736
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
Unless you're the last dragon.

737
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,320
Well, yes.

738
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
Then you nullify it because you...

739
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,320
Yeah.

740
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
If you have the power of the glow, then I think that you can...

741
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:14,720
Okay.

742
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,360
Well, now we're getting into a whole other thing.

743
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,240
You got to check your Venn diagram overlap of do you have IBS and the glow?

744
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
Because they're basically one and the same.

745
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,400
IBS is basically just the glow.

746
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,040
I mean, as for as useful as it turns out to be.

747
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,240
Listen, don't bring your medical science into this, Justin.

748
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,560
All right.

749
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I bought a $12 set of chef mate knives at Target

750
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,360
that lost their sharpness within minutes.

751
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,120
So really, I think that I have like 10 cursed kitchen knives.

752
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
The thing about a great as a curse sword is that anybody can curse a sword.

753
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,480
Yeah.

754
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,800
Right?

755
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,360
Fuck you.

756
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
Fuck this dagger.

757
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:58,800
Right?

758
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,760
Fuck this dagger.

759
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,680
Fucking Wazaikishi, bitch.

760
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,080
And then it's cursed.

761
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
And then it's cursed forever.

762
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,960
Is it a grab bag thing or can you pick what the curse does?

763
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
Or is it just like when you curse, it's just like, oh, sorry, it's a little heavier.

764
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,120
No, they're all IBS.

765
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,720
It's across the board IBS.

766
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,000
You could curse it yourself for the next person to buy it

767
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,760
and just put some jelly on the handle.

768
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,160
Oh, the worst curse.

769
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,680
That's a terrible curse.

770
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,920
I love that that's your go-to curse, Justin.

771
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,240
You're at the Comic-Con and I mean, if you're buying a sword at the Comic-Con,

772
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,480
it's going to have some sort of moisture on it that's going to be unpleasant to the touch.

773
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
Some brand of condensation.

774
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,720
It will have condensed out of the con air.

775
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Not out of the movie.

776
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,240
I mean, specifically out of the air in the convention center.

777
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,480
I have bought, I don't think I've ever bought a sword at a Comic-Con.

778
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,080
I have bought two kendo sticks.

779
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,640
Perfect.

780
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,800
Let's air out our dirty laundry right now because I feel-

781
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,760
I've bought at least four different phasers at Comic-Con.

782
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,320
That's true.

783
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,920
I have bought countless knives, most of them throwing knives.

784
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Man, this is some shit that I bet people would not have guessed about us or they probably,

785
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,560
or they did.

786
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
Probably, absolutely.

787
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
There is something about, yeah, because I think the first knife I ever bought

788
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,800
was like a decorative dragon handle and I bought it at the hunting and fishing show in Huntington.

789
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,320
That's right, that's right.

790
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,520
That's right, nobody's going to fucking skin a deer with this Game of Thrones

791
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,800
Valerian steel blade that you bought at the Huntington Hunting and Fishing Show.

792
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,920
There is something where it's like every day if someone says to me,

793
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,120
hey, do you want a grappling hook?

794
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,880
I'm like, well, no, I'd never use that.

795
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,400
When I'm at, but when I'm at a convention, I see that grappling hook

796
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,320
and I just kind of run my fingers across and go, yeah, I could totally see it.

797
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
I love to envision this at the Hunting and Fishing Show.

798
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,560
Travis, in the corner of the hall,

799
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Travis finds a dark canvas tent scribed in rooms.

800
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,000
Welcome to the Tent of History, come in, wanderer.

801
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,880
It's made of dragon bone and purest mithril.

802
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
Also, do you want some jerky?

803
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,960
I think one of my favorite, this is one of the sales pitches,

804
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,000
I was once given at like 14, it was this triangle shaped black metal blade

805
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,960
and the dude goes, yeah, that totally won't show up in the metal detectors.

806
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,360
Cool thing to say to a kid, to a child.

807
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,800
But I mean, that's for like fighting terrorists on the plane.

808
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
Not for doing the terrorism, but like if there is a terrorist,

809
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
you know how to deal with it.

810
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,600
Oh no, yeah, it's an American made stealth blade, so.

811
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:55,920
I bought kendo sticks because, A, I liked the idea of there being a sport associated with it.

812
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,000
Not a sport that I would say was particularly big in West Virginia.

813
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,440
There wasn't a particularly large kendo community, not a lot of sparring partners,

814
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,400
not many dojos in general, as a rule, but I also liked the non-lethal option.

815
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
You know what I mean? Because what if I was in the parking lot of Mid-Ohio Con

816
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,440
and a couple of iron men came up and started some shit?

817
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,120
I don't want to kill them with it, with Travis's dragon blade.

818
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,560
You know what I mean? I just want to incapacitate-

819
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
I still own that dragon blade, by the way, it's real wicked.

820
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,960
I know you do.

821
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,080
I'll post a picture.

822
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:36,480
I have disavowed myself of all kendo sticks, of all katanadakas.

823
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
Wherever this ended up, just over the years.

824
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Dumpsters, and I gave one to Evan Minsker, so.

825
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,160
The dumpster outside of Evan Minsker's house. Let's be real.

826
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,600
I give them away as gifts, like at weddings and stuff like that.

827
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,960
Before we move on to the next question, I wanted to take you guys on a little journey

828
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
that I went on just now.

829
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,400
I was going to give you guys some Wikipedia information about the hit film, The Last Dragon,

830
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,280
but the only thing we're sharing on here is I want to read you a little bit of the book.

831
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
I want to read you one paragraph.

832
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,080
There are four paragraphs about the production of this film.

833
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,520
Don't read all four.

834
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm not going to.

835
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,480
There's one about Bill Macy being in there because, you know, that's crazy.

836
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,120
Here is the last paragraph in this section.

837
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,120
Julius J. Carey III, in the role of Shonuff, trained in martial arts for the film,

838
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,960
appeared in numerous television roles like Dr. Abraham Butterfield on Dr. Doctor,

839
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,920
and most notably, the bounty hunter Lord Bowler in The Avengers of Briscoe County Jr.

840
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,760
He was a supporting actor in the R. Ray Moore film, Disco Godfather,

841
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,240
and also appeared in The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh and on shows such as Murphy Brown,

842
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,480
Family Matters, A Different World, Two Guys and a Girl at a Pizza Place, and Boy Meets World.

843
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,160
He enjoyed playing basketball.

844
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,960
Carey died August 19, 2008, of pancreatic cancer.

845
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,120
That's the...

846
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,520
He was on Boy Meets World, he enjoyed playing basketball,

847
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
and then he died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.

848
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,840
That's the...

849
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,760
Listen, not to bring it down, you guys.

850
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,680
Listen, I should have ended, in retrospect, I should have ended on the basketball.

851
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, but then the past tense of enjoyed would have left me hanging, like,

852
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,440
where's he at? Where did his soul end up?

853
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,520
Did he stop playing basketball? Does he not enjoy it anymore?

854
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,920
I was under the impression that he had the fucking glow,

855
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,720
and that he would be an earthwalker for the rest of his days, but apparently not.

856
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,600
Apparently not.

857
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
On Boy Meets World, he played Angela's dad, in case anyone was wondering.

858
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,160
And I was.

859
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,040
He also had the glow.

860
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,560
He also had the glow and that.

861
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,040
There's a very, very strange subplot on...

862
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,320
And two guys, a girl and a pizza place, I believe he was the chef at the pizza place.

863
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,400
And he had the glow and that.

864
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
Everybody has the glow.

865
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,520
How about another real question?

866
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
A girl who thought I...

867
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh God, I'm sorry, my reading is just gonna keep getting worse.

868
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,680
A girl who I was...

869
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,160
Okay, this isn't my fault.

870
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
A girl who I was...

871
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,200
I think it's a girl who I thought...

872
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Okay, a girl who I thought could be a potential jeef recently propositioned me,

873
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,040
the old friends with benefits.

874
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,080
This is a first to me, but I happily accepted, as I am moving soon, and no roots would be planted.

875
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,040
The catch is, in our first encounter, I was enlightened to the fact that she is a masochist.

876
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
This too is a first for me.

877
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,000
After a night of exploring, she told me that I do not have the personality to be her dom,

878
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
and said I could be her sub.

879
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,840
Oh, you fucked up the job interview.

880
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,520
You blew the where do you see yourself in five years question.

881
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,840
That's like, yeah, we can't make you the general manager of this branch,

882
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,840
but we will fuck your butt with a broomstick.

883
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Is that cool?

884
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,760
Don't use a broomstick, use one of the many delightful adult toys at extremistranks.com.

885
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,200
You're right, but those might not hurt enough.

886
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,920
Anyway, go ahead.

887
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,160
Brothers, is this endeavor worth exploring if not only to further my experience,

888
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,240
or am I swimming in a sea of sexy that is over my head, that's from BDSM, in Brunswick?

889
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
I mean, it's gotta be pretty fucking sexy,

890
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
because there's like a shitload of people who are into that.

891
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Yeah, I mean, people, obviously, they're making enough money at the place they sell things to do

892
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,680
that they can keep this dumb show running.

893
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,180
True.

894
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:30,320
Our show is, we are basically the sub to the relationship between us and Extreme Restraints.

895
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
They are the Dom.

896
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,920
You are only gonna, I mean, this is a great sort of intro point.

897
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,240
I think you gotta start as a sub and work your way up to a Dom.

898
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Oh, yeah, it's like you can't be a Dom.

899
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,920
Oh, you gotta get the resume credits, you gotta put in 10,000 hours, as Malcolm Gladwell would say.

900
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,420
Yeah.

901
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,440
You can't be an expert at BDSM just when you start.

902
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,960
After 10,000 hours, you would be a fucking hand puppet, man.

903
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,160
You're gonna be limber, you're gonna be just empty.

904
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,080
Just empty, hollowed out.

905
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
Where's my pancreas?

906
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,120
I had a pancreas when I came in here.

907
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,480
Your master has claimed it.

908
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,040
All right.

909
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,120
I mean, being a sub is not all about getting your butt slammed.

910
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,800
No, but I think that if you didn't know the, here's what I'm suggesting.

911
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,280
If you don't know the sort of culture of BDSM, it seems like there would have to be a learning experience.

912
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,520
And if your tutor is the person who's your sub, it seems like it would kind of ruin the fantasy

913
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,040
if they constantly had to be like, no, no, no, just five inches deeper.

914
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,200
I'm cavernous down there.

915
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,760
So yeah, I think as long as she knows that like you're new to this and everything, yeah.

916
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Is there an apprenticeship that he can take on somewhere, like a blacksmith?

917
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
Correspondence course, University of Phoenix.

918
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,000
It sounds like that's what she's offering him.

919
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,760
I mean, right?

920
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,440
It seems like if he doesn't have the personality to be your Dom, she's willing to take on, you know, this young butt.

921
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,760
What if, what if this is all he can do?

922
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,320
What if, what if this is all a huge misunderstanding, and the next time.

923
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,080
No, I said I want to make you a sound.

924
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,920
And the next time that they show up in the bedroom, he's wearing his, you know, his pain shorts,

925
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,960
and he's already strapped himself in to the to the bad boy chair.

926
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:24,240
And then she walks into the room and she is wearing a very convincing Dom Deluise fat suit.

927
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,200
And he has to dress, that is the hottest sex play.

928
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,440
One person dressed like Dom Deluise, the other person dressed like a submarine sandwich.

929
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,000
And he's like a squirt of it.

930
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,280
Dom Deluise just goes fucking crazy on it.

931
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,960
They had to fucking tint the windows of his trailer because of what he did to a subway sandwich.

932
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
I'm gonna eat all the pepperoncinis first.

933
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,160
Put them on my nipples and bend my neck down and eat them right off.

934
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,760
Now, at what point does it stop being like a play thing and start being like a tribute?

935
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
I do a historically accurate Dom Deluise.

936
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,240
It's a two man show.

937
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,880
The other man doesn't have a lot of lines.

938
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,240
I think it's, I think you have to change it to DDSM.

939
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,600
Because the Dom, for as a tribute to our friend Dom.

940
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,080
Dom destroys sandwich meats.

941
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,880
I, you know what, fucking go for it.

942
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,960
You only go around once and you should live like you're dying and just see what this experience

943
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
is like.

944
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Maybe you dig it.

945
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,160
You're only gonna find out if you, I think if you don't enjoy it, obviously, you know,

946
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,120
it's not something you should push yourself into.

947
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,640
But I mean, what the hell?

948
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Give it a shot.

949
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,000
It's the kind of thing you set up a safe word and stuff, right?

950
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

951
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So.

952
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Duck tales?

953
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

954
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Oh, man.

955
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

956
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, sure.

957
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,440
This one was sent in by iRuRae.

958
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
Are you iRuRae?

959
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Who wants to know?

960
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Sorry, too much of a pause.

961
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
I didn't know.

962
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Wanged it.

963
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
It's been a while.

964
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
You wanged it.

965
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Thank you, iRuRae.

966
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:15,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user sk8rboi854856 who asks, how can I make my punches more explosive?

967
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,080
What can I do to make my punches more explosive?

968
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,200
The way I see it, I can.

969
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
Buy a heavy shot put.

970
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,780
Buy a heavy medicine ball.

971
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Do clap push-ups.

972
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Those are hard.

973
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
I bet.

974
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
I've never accomplished one myself.

975
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,120
Does he want his punches to be more powerful or like he wants to punch things and then

976
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
just...

977
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,640
I think explosive is kind of a catch-all.

978
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,800
I think he just wants his punches to be better in general.

979
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Overall better punches.

980
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,520
You know, Bruce Lee had a philosophy where he just saw his power like water because you

981
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,880
pour water into a cup and it takes the shape of a cup.

982
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,280
Or you pour water into a bowl and it takes the shape of a bowl.

983
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,020
So he would take all of his water and put it into his fist and punch like that.

984
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,800
He called it a wet punch and people would be like, oh, what the, oh man, now I'm wet.

985
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Oh man.

986
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Yeah.

987
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,040
And they would be so discombobulated by the dampness that they would not know how to retaliate.

988
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,760
What if you put jelly on his fist?

989
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,280
What would be more unpleasant?

990
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,500
Justin, I'm worried that a lot of your solutions to a lot of your problems are put some preserves

991
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,360
on it.

992
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,160
Are you being paid by Big Jelly?

993
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,840
It's just so unpleasant.

994
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,960
This isn't even the first episode where you suggested you get back at it.

995
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,260
Like a good prank would be to put jelly on somebody's door handle.

996
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,520
Like you are like, you are like Jelly Batman.

997
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,320
I prefer the sticky bandit, but thank you.

998
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,160
Why is my fucking door handle jelly?

999
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
Pray to me.

1000
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,160
What are you doing?

1001
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,480
Stop.

1002
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,760
You're wearing a belt that is just covered in smuckers and you just scooped some smuckers

1003
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,280
off your belt.

1004
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
Why so sticky?

1005
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,360
See, it wasn't even Batman as the Joker.

1006
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,200
He's also the sticky Joker.

1007
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,320
Can you, I'm not wearing something sticky.

1008
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,600
Is that better?

1009
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,300
That's way better.

1010
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:13,640
I mean, you hold, you can hold so many things to augment your punches.

1011
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,280
Oh, that's true.

1012
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Roll of quarters.

1013
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
That's supposed to be good.

1014
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,120
Roll of quarters, dildo from Extreme Restraints.

1015
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,440
Nice dildo punch.

1016
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,880
No one's coming back from that for a lot of reasons.

1017
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,860
You can put a lot of those, you know those little snap things you buy at firework places

1018
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,200
you throw on the ground and then they pop.

1019
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,560
Get a big fistful of those and punch someone with it.

1020
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,880
Don't just like cover your hand in hairspray and light it on fire and then punch them.

1021
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,400
Oh shit, that's good.

1022
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,480
Can you tie- That'd be fucking terrifying.

1023
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,540
Tie your fist to the hood of a car and have them just go.

1024
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,140
Have your friends pick you up and launch you at them.

1025
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,400
That's a good one.

1026
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,000
Can you use- Can you stand on the hood of a car, have your friends drive at someone

1027
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,120
really fast and then stop short and you just fucking fly forward and give them that huge

1028
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,780
inertia punch.

1029
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
I like that.

1030
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,000
Walk upside down from the ceiling with your fist extended and when they walk in the room

1031
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,520
have a friend cut the cord and then you just drop on them with your punch.

1032
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,400
Then you got that extra gravity in there too, that's huge.

1033
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,880
What if you had those big hands- Get on the bottom of a piano and have them

1034
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
drop the piano.

1035
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,080
A lot of mine have to do with dropping.

1036
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,000
What if you have those big hands they had in the Foo Fighters video?

1037
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,540
That would probably be good.

1038
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,120
Just get Dave Grohl to push you into someone.

1039
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Yeah.

1040
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,600
What if you wore a Hulk hand?

1041
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,120
That would depreciate the- But inside the Hulk hands, lead.

1042
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,160
That would still- I still think the softness of the hands would-

1043
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Outside the Hulk hands?

1044
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,560
Okay, inside the Hulk hands, SARS.

1045
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:52,560
So you punch someone, the sponge contracts and expands, pushing the SARS outwards into

1046
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
the person's face.

1047
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Correct.

1048
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,560
That's correct.

1049
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,560
And they're like, oh that didn't hurt and you go, haha.

1050
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Didn't it?

1051
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,560
See you soon.

1052
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,560
See you soon.

1053
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Because you're the angel of death.

1054
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Come back to hell.

1055
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,840
I also don't know how SARS works.

1056
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,880
Oh God.

1057
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm a doctor who specializes in SARS and this is how I get my business.

1058
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,320
I haven't had a lot of business lately.

1059
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
See you real soon.

1060
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,440
Stupid post office security checks.

1061
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,680
Just rotate your hips, I guess.

1062
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,680
Also that works.

1063
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,160
I mean that is what they tell you, I think.

1064
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,160
Really?

1065
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Does that work?

1066
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,280
You put your feet- You spread your feet as far apart as you can possibly make them go.

1067
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,440
If you can do a perfect split, then that's great, because that's the kind of leverage

1068
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
you need.

1069
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,320
Because the important thing to remember is the power doesn't come from your bicep, it

1070
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
comes from your knees.

1071
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,280
And you make the loosest fist you can with your hand, because a loose fist punch hurts

1072
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,440
way more than a tight fist punch.

1073
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,800
And you can hold more jelly that way.

1074
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,400
And you can hold a lot more jelly.

1075
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
That's right, Travis.

1076
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,640
A closed fist holds no jelly, as the old proverb says.

1077
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,080
Bruce Lee said that.

1078
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,960
Then you just give him the old- Slap him.

1079
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Give him the old Bronx handshake.

1080
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
You know what I mean?

1081
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Did you just admit that?

1082
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,760
Did you just admit the Bronx handshake?

1083
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,540
You know, I had a girl give me a Bronx handshake and a sticky joker once, and I broke up with

1084
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,540
her shortly.

1085
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,320
I know, I was like, baby, please don't punch.

1086
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,760
No punching.

1087
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,960
What if this is written by that guy's girlfriend?

1088
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,600
My guy, if there's one thing I know about my boo, he loves punches in his tummy.

1089
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,920
How can I give him that punch juice he so desperately craves?

1090
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,400
A couple days ago, I was texting with a male friend when he suddenly brought up his sexual

1091
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,440
preferences.

1092
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,920
He was quite specific in detailing what he liked to do to women in bed, when before,

1093
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,240
we had hardly grazed any sexual topic before in any conversation.

1094
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,200
He was quick to add that he was kinky and asked a few questions about what I liked,

1095
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,440
like, barf-a-rama.

1096
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,160
This may be incredibly obtuse, but even to their female friends, guys don't just bring

1097
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,940
up this for the sake of idle chatter, right?

1098
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,940
Like ever?

1099
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,800
I mean, he wants to go straight to pound town, right?

1100
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,860
Am I missing something here?

1101
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,600
That's from Textual Sexual Surprised Indianapolis.

1102
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,600
It's pretty good.

1103
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Hey, hey, buddy.

1104
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Hey, pal.

1105
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
I'm into pee.

1106
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,680
Hey, hey, old chum.

1107
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
You know what I like?

1108
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
Armpits.

1109
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,200
Is it, okay, first caveat.

1110
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,480
You can't ignore the possibility that your friend left the room and his asshole friend

1111
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,560
picked up the phone and started texting you about Cleveland stainless and stuff.

1112
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
That's good.

1113
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,560
I like that.

1114
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:51,360
We obviously, just a few sort of like super clear caveats here, we embrace any whatever

1115
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,360
you want.

1116
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,880
Not pee play, though.

1117
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm sorry, the line must be drawn here.

1118
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:05,600
Anything is fine, but like don't change the tenor of your, I mean, you can't just change

1119
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,920
your heading, your course heading in a text.

1120
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,920
It doesn't work that way.

1121
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,520
You can't just decide to change this whole direction.

1122
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
It's a very uncomfortable situation.

1123
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,040
Leave a voicemail at the very least.

1124
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,040
Something, right?

1125
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,600
If you're gonna drop some kink, if you're gonna drop a kink bomb on a...

1126
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Do it on a YouTube.

1127
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,600
On an acquaintance, upload to YouTube.

1128
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Make it private.

1129
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Please.

1130
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Please.

1131
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,960
Send it to a bud.

1132
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,800
Have some decorum.

1133
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,720
This is perhaps the grossest.

1134
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,720
What is offending you about this?

1135
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:48,480
Just the fact that like there's no, these people are complete platonic friends, right?

1136
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,960
This is what they made it sound like.

1137
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,840
He has skipped, even if they didn't wanna, even if he didn't like, even if they were

1138
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:06,320
not destined to date, even if they were gonna go like straight friends and binnies, he has

1139
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:15,560
skipped every fucking step between, hey pal, how's it going, do you wanna join my kickball

1140
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,200
league, and let me pee in your hair.

1141
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,680
At what time of day did this occur?

1142
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,620
Because if it was like two o'clock in the morning, he might have been drunk.

1143
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:32,840
Not that I think that makes that better or makes it okay, but I'm just saying like maybe

1144
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,920
that was his games, like oh, I was just drunk, but he was testing the waters, and with the

1145
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,280
excuse of saying he was drunk later, which is a dick move, ah god, see the problem with

1146
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,580
this is you can't go back.

1147
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,800
You can't, because either your friend wants to pee in your hair or he's a total fucking

1148
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,260
weird beard.

1149
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,920
I mean, maybe it can be both, but like either he just thinks that a cool thing to do with

1150
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:05,240
the friends that he's not especially close to is to text about his armpit play.

1151
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,520
And the weirdness is not this thing, I mean, to be clear, I feel like you guys aren't being

1152
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,520
clear enough about this.

1153
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,800
I'm not saying it's weird to be into pee or armpits, like nothing is weird, everything

1154
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,800
is accepted.

1155
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,280
No, no, no, I'm saying that the weird thing is the non sequitur shift to be like, hey,

1156
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,280
do you wanna go see Greg Gatsby this weekend?

1157
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,920
Oh, also, I really like it when people dress me up like Little Bo Peep.

1158
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:37,440
It's like, oh, I do wanna see Greg Gatsby, but now not with you.

1159
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,040
Why would you wanna see fucking Greg Gatsby anyway?

1160
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,520
I wanna see it more when I saw a Photoshop of Greg Gatsby, but that's just-

1161
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,000
I would see that movie!

1162
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I know!

1163
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,280
But yeah, that's the thing is it's not about what the dude's into, because fuck it, but

1164
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,320
like, hey man, don't put people on the spot.

1165
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Don't put people on blast.

1166
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,400
I think that you are within your rights to either confront this dude and be like, hey

1167
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,040
man, that's not cool, you know, like, hey, for a lot of reasons, but like, where'd that

1168
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,040
come from?

1169
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
Unless.

1170
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
Unless.

1171
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,920
We're always telling people to live like they were dying.

1172
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,800
What if we accidentally gave this guy the advice to do this thing?

1173
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,160
Like, I've got this girl that I really, really like, so far all of our communique has been

1174
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,120
totally platonic.

1175
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,440
How do I set things off and get weird with her and her armpits as I am wont to do?

1176
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,320
Okay, so let's look at this from a future advice kind of thing.

1177
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,640
If anybody listening here wants to tell some random person about all of their stuff, please,

1178
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,360
please, please start it off with, hey, I'd like to tell you something kind of personal

1179
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,680
or I have something, not like just random chatting about like, hey, what are you going

1180
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,160
to do for dinner?

1181
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:59,840
Doesn't that sort of erode the sexual topsoil of their, the geography of their friendship

1182
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
though?

1183
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,240
Like, doesn't that kind of, if you want to explain your kinkiness to somebody, doesn't

1184
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,240
it kind of negate that to be like, hey, heads up, things are about to get pretty crazy in

1185
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
here.

1186
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
Brace your face.

1187
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,280
Your SMS message is about to get naughty.

1188
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,240
Is the problem with this that the friend is assuming his sexual preference?

1189
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,480
Because I feel like if this is a platonic male and female, that there wouldn't be the

1190
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:32,040
same, you know, it wouldn't have some of the same attachments, right?

1191
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,000
I don't understand because it's a male friend who says what he likes to do to women in bed.

1192
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,280
Yeah, she is, she is a girl.

1193
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,360
I'm almost certain.

1194
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,480
She is a woman.

1195
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,800
I know for a fact because I put the question.

1196
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Okay.

1197
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Well, all right.

1198
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Okay.

1199
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,680
So here's, I like, here's, I, we are missing the bigger question.

1200
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
What which is?

1201
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:57,800
The bigger question is she is asking with him bringing this up, is he just like randomly

1202
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,440
telling me as a friend all the weird stuff he's into or does he want to go to the bone

1203
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
zone?

1204
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Oh no, dear.

1205
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,440
Oh no.

1206
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
Madam.

1207
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
Madam.

1208
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,440
No.

1209
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Magnumus.

1210
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
This is an easy one.

1211
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Thank you, Travis.

1212
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,460
Let me put this into stark belief.

1213
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,360
He's definitely trying to have sex with you.

1214
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,460
There's not like, this is not, this is not.

1215
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,460
And let us also be.

1216
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,160
Let me check my advocates real quick.

1217
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,760
Click, click, click, click, click, click.

1218
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,760
Yes.

1219
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,120
Let us also be clear.

1220
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:30,640
If this question were about, I have a friend who likes salt water taffy, but I like sweet

1221
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,120
water taffy.

1222
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,200
Our response would be, he wants to have sex with you.

1223
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,040
There is, yeah, I mean, yes, that's correct.

1224
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
You are right.

1225
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,160
He has gone about, okay, see, now your guys' response, if she's a woman, that makes so

1226
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,480
much more sense why you guys are, I mean, that's very, that's, that's very presumptuous

1227
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
of him.

1228
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,720
It would be presumptuous either way, but that is very presumptuous of him to start sending.

1229
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,720
Right.

1230
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,720
That's.

1231
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,720
Yeah.

1232
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,760
Don't do that.

1233
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Yeah.

1234
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:12,260
So I, I would say he definitely wants to have sex with you and it seems like even if you,

1235
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,420
even if your preferences a hundred percent synced up with his, his assumption that you

1236
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:23,780
would based on no prior discussion tells me that he's not a dude you want to continue

1237
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,040
to associate with.

1238
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,000
But what if she's into that?

1239
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,240
Like it sounds like we wouldn't be asking us the question, but we're just assuming that

1240
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,320
this guy is a total mustachioed weirdo.

1241
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,440
But what if he's just like a fucking like Gordon Gekko, like, let me cut to the chase.

1242
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
P boom.

1243
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
Bada boop.

1244
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
Bada beep.

1245
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
Bada boop.

1246
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,440
I like P. I like P, are you in?

1247
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
Yow.

1248
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,440
Zip zap.

1249
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Bada boop.

1250
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Gross.

1251
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Gross is good.

1252
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
Gross.

1253
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm going to cut to the chase.

1254
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
No fluff.

1255
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,680
No bullshit.

1256
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,480
My P, your hair tonight.

1257
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Bada boop.

1258
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,800
All that, I mean, it is fair to point out that like texting is pretty cumbersome.

1259
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,320
So he didn't want to spend a lot of characters on romance, I don't think that that's so.

1260
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,200
He just said it was two characters.

1261
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,760
It was a capital P and a question mark.

1262
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,760
And then, and then in a follow up text, bada boop.

1263
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,920
And then a smiley, a winky face emoticon.

1264
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,040
Like yeah, we get, we didn't need the emoticon.

1265
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,640
I think we all got the intended purpose of the original message and my answer is yes.

1266
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,640
Tonight.

1267
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,640
Absolutely.

1268
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,920
At the Motel 12.

1269
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,400
Don't tell a soul.

1270
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,320
It's two Motel 6's back to back.

1271
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,840
I want you to pee on me between them.

1272
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,320
I mean, bada boop.

1273
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,600
What I would like to know her response, right?

1274
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:57,080
Like what he must've been getting a much different vibe than, than she was from their texts.

1275
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,680
Like it is a very sort of like, I don't know what if he said like, do you want to go see

1276
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
great Gatsby?

1277
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:10,760
And she said, Oh, I'd rather have someone pee on my hair at the moment he should mention

1278
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
that.

1279
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,800
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1280
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,560
We sure appreciate everybody listening to the show.

1281
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,400
Thank you to everyone tweeting at us.

1282
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:27,920
Alonzo Durald, Kat, Jonathan Mitchell, Tyler Watt, Ian Johnson, Jacob Blocker, of course,

1283
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:38,360
our man, Drew Davenport, DM, Garrett Smith, Pepperoni Sinclair, Nicole Tompkins, and put

1284
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:45,840
together an East Coast MBMB AM meetup to send off our friend, the Triscuit off to, off,

1285
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,960
off to, he's, he's shipping out to Afghanistan.

1286
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,520
So we, we wish him all the best and we hope that they had a, a great time out there.

1287
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,720
And of course we'll keep him in our, our hearts and minds.

1288
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,720
Yeah.

1289
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,160
He's going to have a great time out in Afghanistan, just like chilling.

1290
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,160
I hope he just has a wonderful time.

1291
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,800
No, I think it'll be a real character builder.

1292
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,560
So I think he's got plenty of character.

1293
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,120
He's like fucking USA.

1294
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
He's fucking characters.

1295
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,120
Welcome.

1296
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,120
Thank you.

1297
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:18,920
I guess thank you for defending our, they actually had a beautiful banner at the, at

1298
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,320
the meetup that just said, getting it nice.

1299
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,080
So unless that wasn't at the meetup and just at somebody's house, which either way I'm

1300
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,320
just looking at Twitter and there's a lot of things on there.

1301
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,960
And we, we, we so appreciate you guys listening to the show and tweeting about it.

1302
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:42,280
If you want to share our sampler bit.ly forward slash MBMB AM 2013, it's a great way to get

1303
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,120
people into the show if they're not already listening.

1304
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:52,280
I want to thank everybody who sent in Yahoo answers seriously, like 10 times as many as

1305
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
I got last week.

1306
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,540
Like everybody fucking answered back my plea.

1307
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,540
Thank you guys so much.

1308
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,080
I also want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1309
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,760
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1310
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,120
Fuck your daft punk album is what I'm saying.

1311
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,120
Daft punk?

1312
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,120
No, thanks.

1313
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,120
Vampire weekend.

1314
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,120
Who needs it?

1315
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,560
It's just this same album over and over again.

1316
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,440
Two quick max fun con reminders.

1317
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,720
One, we're going to be at max fun con.

1318
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,240
So if you're going to be there to start formulating questions in your head that you would like

1319
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,200
to have answered at the live show and then come find us at some point during the weekend

1320
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,120
so that maybe we can have you have your question answered live.

1321
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,560
And two, for all of you who will not be at max fun con, just remember that because we're

1322
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,880
doing a live show, it always takes us a little bit longer to publish, so it'll probably be

1323
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,880
a little bit late.

1324
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,920
We should also probably talk about the fact that we may have to miss an episode, not next

1325
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
week but the week after when Justin and I are at E3.

1326
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,720
So just get prepped for the fact that June 10th may be kind of a dry one, by which I

1327
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,720
mean non-existent.

1328
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,640
There won't be many jokes that week.

1329
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,720
Not a lot of jokes.

1330
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,720
Keep us in your heart still.

1331
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,880
Hope you won't forget about us.

1332
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,520
A third reminder for those of you who are attending max fun con, please don't speak

1333
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
to me.

1334
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
No, talk to Justin.

1335
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
Talk especially to Justin.

1336
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,640
Talk to Justin but don't make eye contact.

1337
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,640
He's sort of like the face.

1338
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,080
No, don't make any jokes because then people will do it and I'll forget about the joke

1339
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,480
and I'll think everyone's gone insane.

1340
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,360
He's like the face of the A-team.

1341
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,360
Our A-team.

1342
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Here's what's important.

1343
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,360
When you see Justin, form a protective barrier around him but facing outward.

1344
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,280
Don't make Justin look at your eyes with his eyes.

1345
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,280
Don't make me uncomfortable.

1346
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,080
Be like, no, do say hi though.

1347
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,760
I'll be upset if you don't come say hi.

1348
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:49,000
And then be prepared to courier messages between Justin and John Hodgman and back because they

1349
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
do not speak to each other.

1350
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,560
So much beef still.

1351
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,680
They've got, there's this crazy east coast, east coast beef with those two that I just

1352
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,160
don't understand.

1353
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:01,360
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1354
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Thank you, Drew.

1355
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,040
It's by Yahoo answer user Dan G who asks, I'm going to read this in an appropriately

1356
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,600
disappointed voice.

1357
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:18,520
Why does my son make laser gun noises in the bathroom?

1358
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,760
I'm Justin McElroy.

1359
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

1360
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1361
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.
