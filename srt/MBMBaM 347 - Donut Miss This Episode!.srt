1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi folks, this is Griffin McElroy, your baby brother.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,960
And this is Travis McElroy, your middlest brother.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,840
And what you're about to hear is the first episode

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,180
of the Max Fun Drive 2017,

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,800
Welcome to the Slam and Come On and Jam and all that.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,240
Justin's not here by the way.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,920
Cause he got slammed and jammed.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,760
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
He literally got turned into a basketball

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,200
and he got dunked through a hoop

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,880
and he fell into a cartoon alternate universe

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,840
and he got put through a hoop

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
and like he needs surgery and stuff now.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,560
It's very sad, but you know what?

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,600
It's the risk you take when you play with the Monstars.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
You know what I mean?

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Yeah.

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,560
In the game of jams, you win or you die.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,400
Exactly.

20
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,280
Well, Justin lost and lived.

21
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,960
But anyway, that's all beside the point.

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,200
What you need to know about this episode,

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,680
one, we recorded it in Portland hours

24
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,360
before our Portland live show,

25
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,960
which by the way, hey Portland, what's up?

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
Thanks for coming out on Saturday.

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,160
We had a good time and a good night with you.

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,960
That live episode, we are probably gonna save

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,240
until after the Max Fun Drive,

30
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,240
but it was super fucking fun and very weird and really long.

31
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,000
It was like our longest live show ever.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,120
So it was a blast.

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
The other thing you should probably know

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,080
about this episode, what's a good way to put this?

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,200
Okay, so we recorded it in a hotel room altogether

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
using a new setup and there's some minor audio issues.

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Travis sounds like he's maybe recording

38
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
from a well or something.

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,960
You can listen, don't let Griffin oversell it.

40
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,760
You can totally understand everything I say

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,880
and you can hear me.

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,760
It just sounds like Griffin and Justin

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,320
made me record in the hallway

44
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,760
while they were in the hotel room.

45
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,720
Travis got put in the boo-boo box.

46
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Anyway, that's not great.

47
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
And also there's a little bit of static interference

48
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
that pops up every now and then.

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,960
It's not like super loud or anything like that,

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,560
but it's kind of annoying.

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,960
We're recording this because it's Max Fun Drive

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,840
and the last thing we want you to think

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,280
is that we just kind of shit some stuff out.

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,840
We recorded like a dozen podcasts last week

55
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,800
and we actually have a lot more to record this week too

56
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,720
and so this was sort of like the only way

57
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
we could do this one and we just didn't realize

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,120
that it wasn't up to our normal standards

59
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,720
and that is regrettable considering

60
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,400
it's the first week of the Max Fun Drive

61
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,080
and we hope it doesn't reflect poorly on us

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
or like what we think of the drive

63
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,960
or you, the listeners, for supporting us

64
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,360
because this episode aside, we really do spend your money

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
to improve the show technically.

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,600
So yes, we are sorry for the somewhat poor quality

67
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
of the audio of this episode.

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
But that said, I will say there were some moments of this

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,880
where I was laughing my head off

70
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,040
because like we're so very rarely,

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,520
just as a little teaser,

72
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,040
we do finally nail down our pitch for Austin Powers 4.

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,440
Yes, there's very exciting, very important stuff

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
to the canon of the podcast.

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,720
So first off, thank you all for listening.

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,600
Thank you all for being members of the Max Fun Network.

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,960
We're gonna talk a lot about that in the actual episode

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
but it really does mean a lot

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
that you all would support us and help us to grow

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
and like do stuff like travel to Portland

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
and do a fun live show there and do all this stuff.

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
We really appreciate you very, very much.

83
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,360
The other thing, as sort of a mea culpa,

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,120
sort of an apology for the less than awesome

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
audio quality of this episode,

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,720
we're gonna be putting out another thing

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,600
this probably later this week, don't you think?

88
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah, definitely.

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
Maybe Thursday or Friday, somewhere in there.

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
That we also recorded while we were in Portland

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
and we can't give away,

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
I don't wanna give away too much

93
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
about this thing that we recorded.

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
It could turn out to be the pilot of the next serial

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
is what I'll say that. This is true, yeah.

96
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll also say we recorded this episode

97
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,000
that you're about to hear before the live show.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,880
We recorded this other thing after the live show

99
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,140
and let's just say there was a unique,

100
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,840
wink, wink, wink, energy in the space.

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Wink, wink, wink.

102
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,160
So that will be up later this week.

103
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,560
But in the meantime,

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,440
like brace yourselves for a little bit of audio issues,

105
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,280
but like an episode that I'm actually really proud of

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
and I would have been really sad

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,160
if we had had to dump it. I know.

108
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
So I'm very glad that you can,

109
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,240
listen, still totally listenable.

110
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,640
So don't let this turn you off.

111
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,440
Portland is just an audio wormhole

112
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,840
because the live show, the only live show

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,920
we've never published got up in Portland too.

114
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,520
There's just, I love Portland, man,

115
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
love getting to the port city.

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,280
There's audio demons and gremlins all over.

117
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,440
Sasquatches, audio sasquatches.

118
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,360
White noise just all over, just trying to creep on you.

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Anyway, that's it for this apology press conference.

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
Any questions?

121
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
if you wanna just get it out of the way now.

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
Okay, yes, and then you're legally allowed

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,920
to skip all the Max Fun Drive spots in this episode.

125
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,220
Okay, let's get right to it.

126
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,880
The McElroy brothers are not experts

127
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,760
and their advice should never be followed.

128
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,120
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,860
Also, this show isn't for kids,

131
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,240
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

132
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
will know how cool they are for listening.

133
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
What's up, you cool baby?

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:18,760
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar, it's a new craze.

135
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,760
And good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

136
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,160
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and the Advice Show for the modern era.

137
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin, Tyler McElroy.

138
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis, Tyler McElroy.

139
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler.

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,760
You'll pay for the whole Tyler, but you'll only use the edge.

141
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,200
Did you send out questions, Travis?

142
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
I did, why?

143
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,600
This is first, foremost, welcome to Max Fun Drive.

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
Hell yeah, you did it, and we decided to do something

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
real fucking special for you this time,

146
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,840
which is to say we just ate a bunch of Voodoo donuts

147
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,360
and I'm just fucking feeling it so hard, dude.

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,080
Yeah, this is the donut, what's a good, catchy, zingy?

149
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,200
Donut, skip this episode.

150
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
No, that's not a good.

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
It's really good.

152
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Donuts for donuts.

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,200
No, the donutagon, the donutahedron.

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Donutahedron.

155
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,520
Like, we had spaghetti again, and I feel like this is the follow-up,

156
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
because we're jacked on.

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
We're fucking jacked on donuts.

158
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Jacked on donuts.

159
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Sugar.

160
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,280
We're in Portland, we're doing our Portland live show,

161
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
and you know, we're all in the same room,

162
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,080
so we thought, let's just make a very special episode.

163
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,120
This is a chill, can you take a picture of this chill-ass sesh?

164
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,160
I mean, not during the podcast, but probably during.

165
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, maybe not during, but Travis has this hooked up to the lav mics,

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,760
which is weird, because I need that fucking totem of comedy in front of me.

167
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah, it just feels like we're talking to each other, but I hate it.

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,920
I need that big metal comedy dong in front of me

169
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,800
that I can just sort of shout into.

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,160
So it's weird, like I'm just looking at you and talking and like,

171
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
is this being recorded?

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
And I look down at this dumb old doohickey on my chest,

173
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,480
and I'm like, oh yeah, this is good.

174
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,720
So wait, so you say you sent questions.

175
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I did, episode 347.

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,880
I literally titled it 347, Max Fun Drive week one,

177
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
recorded live in Portland.

178
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,680
Oh, you sent it like a grip ago.

179
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,600
Dude, you sent it on March 16th.

180
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
That was two days ago.

181
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,760
Yeah, that was before St. Patrick's Day.

182
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,640
I was prepared.

183
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
So let's first start off with this.

184
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Let's first start off with this.

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Let's start off with this.

186
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,400
Justin's pointing at me, so it's a vote.

187
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I want to start off with this.

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Well, hold on, mine was...

189
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
No, I both, I want to start off.

190
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
Oh, okay.

191
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I don't have anything.

192
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,360
Okay, I got on an elevator last night

193
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,320
when I got here to Portland at 12.45 a.m.

194
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,480
with a St. Patrick's Day celebrant

195
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,600
who smelled so much like two people's yards

196
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,360
that it made me not want to be in the elevator with him.

197
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,440
And so Portland just goes hard.

198
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,280
I didn't know.

199
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Yeah, I didn't know y'all went hard.

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,640
You don't see that on the Portlandia comedy show.

201
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,840
You don't see people going fucking deep in the paint

202
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,160
to celebrate St. Patrick's great sacrifice.

203
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,880
I'll balance that out by saying I went to Rose and Thistle,

204
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,800
local favorite, Rose and Thistle,

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
had a nice, pleasant corned beef and cabbage,

206
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
and again, it was very chill, and I left.

207
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,280
Now, granted, this was five o'clock,

208
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,000
so I don't think we'd hit peak celebration time.

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Yeah.

210
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
But speaking of celebration-

211
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,800
Hey, let's celebrate.

212
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
What I wanted to start off with is

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,680
it's week one of Max Fun Drive,

214
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,640
and we're gonna tell you all about it as we go through.

215
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,520
But right now, maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

216
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
You know what?

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Listen, there's gonna be two weeks

218
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,080
of people giving you really good reasons

219
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,200
why you should donate.

220
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Why not just do it now?

221
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
And it's like, I'm done.

222
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,360
Yeah, I agree.

223
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
And get that all out of the way.

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,040
And you know what?

225
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
Skip those parts.

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,240
Yeah, then you're legally allowed to fast forward

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
through the parts of this show

228
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,040
that you don't wanna listen to.

229
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,840
So if you have been waiting for the perfect time

230
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
to become a Max Fun donor, it's now.

231
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,080
It's the my brother, my brother, me fast pass.

232
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Go ahead and fast and donate now.

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
But listen, if you try to fast forward

234
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
and you didn't donate, we'll know

235
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,680
and we'll shock your finger.

236
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,600
I have been waiting to reveal this to you

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,760
until we were all recording.

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
Last night, I arrived in the evening

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,720
a few hours after my brother Travis did.

241
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,520
And I called him to say what,

242
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
you know what I'm about to say.

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes, it is.

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,520
I called him and I said, where are you at?

245
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
He said, I'm in the hotel.

246
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm right above you.

247
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,040
So I would go up to his room.

248
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
He said, I just, and then when I called,

249
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
he said, I just got dessert, come on up.

250
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
I was like, okay, cool.

251
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,680
I go up, my little brother Travis

252
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,680
has ordered three discrete desserts for himself.

253
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Oh, that's no.

254
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
That's no knowledge of my presence.

255
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
Travis has ordered three discrete desserts.

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
When I asked him, when I inquired,

257
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
what would possess him to get three discrete desserts?

258
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,560
He told me I was bored.

259
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,640
So that is not, I don't think that that.

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
I wanted to, yeah, okay, listen.

261
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
What were the three desserts?

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
First off, let me hit the show.

263
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Thank you.

264
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
First it was, I believe it was a peanut chocolate bomb

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,640
with salted caramel.

266
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,040
And then there was a like vanilla ice cream

267
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
and chocolate brownie number.

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,440
And a set of three creme brulees,

269
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
or as I like to call them, creme delays.

270
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Why?

271
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
Because I used to make a delay hill.

272
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
Okay, yeah, sure.

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,880
Love that guy.

274
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
And so I had three creme delays.

275
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
And.

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,240
You know he's fucked up and said it that way once.

277
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,120
And Mr. Hill, will you have the creme delay?

278
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
I mean, shit.

279
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,480
Shit.

280
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,680
And I had not intended to eat all three of them.

281
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,280
I just wanted to sample what life in Portland hotels was like.

282
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Yeah.

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
This is a good hotel though.

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,320
I'm enjoying this hotel, the Hotel Eastland

285
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
is where we're staying.

286
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, yeah, people won't hear this.

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,040
They'll have to run out of it.

288
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Right, Hotel Eastland, room 205 at 305.

289
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Better luck next time, murderers.

290
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,520
You'll never murder us this time.

291
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,120
You'll catch us on the next go round.

292
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,920
This is gonna be really sad if we do get murdered.

293
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Portland, this is released posthumously.

294
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
Should we get going?

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah, let's go.

296
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm gonna tell you about the Max Fun Drive

297
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
and the cool stuff you can earn.

298
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
Just go donate, you'll get cool stuff.

299
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
We really need it and appreciate it.

300
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
MaxFunFun.org forward slash donate.

301
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
Donate.

302
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm a busboy at a popular chain restaurant

303
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
and I need some advice.

304
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,520
I frequently work long shifts

305
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,800
that begin early in the morning

306
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
and end in the late afternoon with no break.

307
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
And I have a tendency to skimp on breakfast.

308
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
So bad.

309
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,280
Tim Ferriss says you need 30 grams of protein

310
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,760
within 30 minutes of waking up.

311
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
Who says this?

312
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Tim Ferriss for our work week for our body.

313
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Oh, I don't know who that is.

314
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
It's a slow carb diet.

315
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,400
Slow carb?

316
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,240
Slow carb?

317
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,560
Yeah, it's like low carb.

318
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,000
It's like low carb minus cheese and dairy plus beans.

319
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,640
So beans at every meal.

320
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,480
So you go to the Cheesecake Factory

321
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
and you just really take your time.

322
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
No, you don't.

323
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
No, what?

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,720
You're not listening to me.

325
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,480
Travis, should we turn the air conditioner off, you think?

326
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm worried it's gonna get big.

327
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
No, listen, I want people to know

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
what it feels like to be in a hotel room.

329
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Okay, well, we're nice and cool.

330
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
No, I've been doing it.

331
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
That's why I was so hyped about donuts.

332
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Actually, why, I'm kinda surprised

333
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,840
you didn't drop this bomb.

334
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
We'll get back to this question in a second.

335
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,160
I've been doing the slow carb diet,

336
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,880
so I've only been eating no sugar, nothing white,

337
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,880
no milk, no dairy, no sugar, no fruit, no...

338
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
Well, this is a bad diet.

339
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,200
If it's like, don't fruit it up, dude.

340
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,160
Now, do you think your ancestors

341
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,040
had easy accessibility to fruit?

342
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, they just looked up in a tree

343
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
and they're like, let's eat those.

344
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
There's some red stuff up here, that's weird.

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
Fruit toast is sugar, it's sugar, guys.

346
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Hey, guys, it's sugar.

347
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,840
So wait, you're telling me that you have the inside scoop

348
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
that fruit is bad for you?

349
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,400
Fruit's bad, you heard it here first.

350
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
Fruit is sugar.

351
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,160
You're dropping on me, you're dropping on me.

352
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Hold up, we'll get back to the question in a second.

353
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,080
Fruit is bad for you.

354
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,480
Signed, Justin Mackerel.

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,160
No, if I was a person of a healthy weight,

356
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,440
fruit in moderation would be good for me.

357
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
I'm not.

358
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
But once you get overweight,

359
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
you're not allowed to have fruit anymore?

360
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
Because now fruit is bad for you?

361
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,080
No, because it's just sugar, guys.

362
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,680
It's high, okay, Travis, where does sugar come from?

363
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,080
No, tell me, this is not a joke.

364
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,480
Bees. Bees, okay, bad.

365
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
Space.

366
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,160
Where does sugar come from, Travis?

367
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,120
Not space, you know where does sugar come from?

368
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
It comes from cane, Justin.

369
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Which is a plant that grows from being ground.

370
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,240
So why is it that if you eat a bunch of that plant,

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,520
that's a bad thing you should avoid for diet,

372
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,560
but if you eat one that looks like runts, then it's fine.

373
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
Well, runts is a great, you've complicated this

374
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
by bringing runts into the equation

375
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
because I look at these little guys and I'm like,

376
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
is it fruit or no?

377
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Because it sure as hell looks like it.

378
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
They should make candy shaped like vegetables.

379
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,560
I have to eat 30 grams of protein

380
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,040
within 30 minutes of waking.

381
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Or you will die.

382
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,040
With beans.

383
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,280
It's like that Jason Statham movie.

384
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,040
Every morning I wake up and eat four scrambled eggs

385
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,480
and a bunch of lentils and black beans

386
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,840
and vegetables sometimes within 30 minutes of waking.

387
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,520
Sydney says, and I quote,

388
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,920
that is not a smell I ever want to wake up to again.

389
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,200
I have no choice, that's why I have to eat it.

390
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,280
And I don't want to be blue here,

391
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,160
so let's be delicate.

392
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,960
But how's your 9 a.m. constitutional?

393
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,520
How's your beamers?

394
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Not applicable.

395
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
But anyway, on the seventh day.

396
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,680
You just put the questions down.

397
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
There's no, Justin just made the decision of,

398
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
well, I'm not going back to this.

399
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,120
No, I'm going back to it.

400
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
I just want to say that one of the things

401
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
is on the seventh day on Saturday.

402
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,040
Justin rests.

403
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
That day is Justin, Justin.

404
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Pretty much, because I have to eat like a garbage person.

405
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
What?

406
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
No, this is a bad diet.

407
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,240
So that's why I was so excited

408
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
and why at six a.m. this morning,

409
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
when Griffin woke up and used the bathroom,

410
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,920
I was sitting in my bed with a laptop on my lap

411
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,120
and Griffin said, what are you doing?

412
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,360
I said, I'm looking at donuts.

413
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,960
Because I was planning to eat my donuts

414
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,400
like a garbage person.

415
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,800
This is a, did you consult a physician or a teacher?

416
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, I got one that I know pretty well.

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Okay, all right.

418
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
Can we, you want to get back to the question?

419
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Okay, so where were we?

421
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,000
Good, you guys are good.

422
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Bus boy to popular chain restaurant.

423
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,000
Bus boy to popular chain restaurant needs my advice.

424
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Work long shifts that begin early in the morning

425
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,360
and late in the afternoon with no break

426
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
and I have a tendency to skimp on breakfast.

427
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,440
About a week ago, I was five-ish hours into a shift

428
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,160
after having eaten nothing but banana in the morning

429
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,920
and I was getting to the hunger level

430
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,360
where I started to feel sick.

431
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
Seeing no other options,

432
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,800
I took an untouched plate of biscuits back into the kitchen

433
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
and had a couple bites.

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,240
It took me to join this and quickly went back to work.

435
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
When I got home, I recounted the dark deed

436
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I had committed to my friends

437
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,480
and they said, not only is it not gross

438
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,080
to eat a stranger's unwanted food,

439
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,440
but they encouraged me to do it all the time

440
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,640
and with foods that are tastier than the biscuits.

441
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,460
Not applicable, but fine.

442
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,520
I love my friends, but I have seen them eat off the ground

443
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,060
and out of the trash.

444
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,920
So I don't really trust their judgment here.

445
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,000
My friends are raccoons.

446
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,280
How am I for doing what I did?

447
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,160
Should I throw away all caution and dignity in the wind

448
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,320
and eat a Rando's mac and cheese?

449
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,440
That's from Damiao.

450
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,240
The thing is, is this is fine

451
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,440
right up until the point where you are observant.

452
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,280
Yes.

453
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,480
It's like, yeah, okay, you ate a bite off that thing, cool.

454
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
Now picture that, but your boss is there?

455
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,680
Or is this fine?

456
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,320
Or I'm so on the side of just eat the fucking food.

457
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,980
Don't throw good food in a garbage can.

458
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,820
That's so wasteful.

459
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,120
We're a huge waste in this country.

460
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,080
But if I go to Bob Evans

461
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,160
and those were my biscuits that I bought and paid for

462
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,740
and then I leave and I'm like, oh, I left my coat.

463
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,840
I gotta go get my coat back.

464
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,840
And I walk back in and I see you eating my fucking biscuits.

465
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,400
I would shout, I would point at you

466
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,520
and I would shout, thief, thief, thief.

467
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,560
Oh, this should be like in ride sharing

468
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,960
where it's like, if you share a lift with someone

469
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
you split the cost.

470
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
You can have those biscuits,

471
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
but half of those biscuits are going on your bill now.

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Holy shit, Travis.

473
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Okay.

474
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,280
Biscuit app.

475
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,080
Biscuit, B-S-K-T is the app.

476
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,920
And here's the app.

477
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
Biscuit does not have a K in it.

478
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,360
It does now, it's so cool.

479
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
We're shortening it to biscuit.

480
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,160
Shortening, shortening it.

481
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
There's something there.

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,820
There's something there.

483
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,660
There's something there.

484
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,480
We'll get to it.

485
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,840
You push the button on biscuit.

486
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,680
Biscuit.

487
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,520
When you say I have.

488
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,880
It shows you the nearest uneaten biscuit.

489
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,120
No, it's the inverse.

490
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
It's both.

491
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,860
There's two sides of it.

492
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,280
So if you have a bunch of unfinished touch food

493
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
and it's like, oh God, I feel terrible

494
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
about throwing this away.

495
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Press the biscuit.

496
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,840
You load up biscuit and you load it and say,

497
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
I got some grub here.

498
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,080
And you put a little flag or something

499
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,240
so they don't get rid of it.

500
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
And then if you're hungry

501
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
and you don't want to pay for the food,

502
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,760
you press the button.

503
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,200
It's like, where's some food around here?

504
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,320
And it connects.

505
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,160
It's connected.

506
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,480
But then you have to go to the Bob Evans

507
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,600
and be like, sir, table for one?

508
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,480
It's like, no, don't worry about me.

509
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,400
I was led to believe there were some loose

510
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,240
rogue biscuits.

511
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,060
Listen, listen, listen.

512
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,120
I'm operating outside of your traditional restaurant norms.

513
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,520
Don't worry about me.

514
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,080
Don't even think about me.

515
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
I don't mind sharing a table.

516
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,360
I've worked a couple of different breakfast restaurants before

517
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,760
and a couple of different iterations.

518
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,240
And I have stolen food before it's made it

519
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,880
to someone's plate.

520
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
What?

521
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,800
Like, I worked at a hotel breakfast restaurant place

522
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,760
where they just had like a bunch of like Danishes

523
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,600
and I would just eat them.

524
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,880
Like they were just there.

525
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,600
But this is not made to order.

526
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,440
No, no, no, no.

527
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,280
These are just Danish.

528
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
No, but I definitely worked at the Olive Garden

529
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,200
and I definitely a few times was like,

530
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,040
ooh, future mini calamari on this plate.

531
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,160
Don't wanna, and then just snap.

532
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,040
That's called the angel's share.

533
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,400
The angel's share of calamari.

534
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,040
We talk a lot about our former jobs.

535
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,560
And this is a question that maybe a legal law person

536
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,680
could answer for us.

537
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,600
But is it possible to get after fired in some way?

538
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,440
Post-fired, yeah.

539
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,600
Post-fired, because we're sort of braggadocious

540
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
about our little Robin Hood-esque acts.

541
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,240
I actually think I'm beyond statute of limitations.

542
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
Oh, defo.

543
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,900
Yeah, fine.

544
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,000
When I quit that breakfast restaurant hotel place,

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
I just took two boxes of frozen Danishes with me.

546
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
That was my severance.

547
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
That was my breakfast severance.

548
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,360
They, the best thing about working at the Olive Garden

549
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,280
is every few weeks, well, not every few weeks,

550
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,440
cause it wouldn't have had to be every few days.

551
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
They serve chicken tenders for kids at the Olive Garden,

552
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,780
but they come frozen, right?

553
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,780
And some of the tenders would break or into smaller pieces.

554
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,660
So after you distributed all the tenders,

555
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,580
you would be left with, at the bottom of the bag,

556
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,300
just some unservable nugs.

557
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,140
Some chicken leave-ins.

558
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,980
Because we didn't have nuggets, we had tenders.

559
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,380
So the best day of all of our lives

560
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,260
is we would just dump all those into the fryer,

561
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,340
and that was like nudge day.

562
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,180
Ah, damn.

563
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,000
At Olive Garden.

564
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,140
And you bring them out and everybody's like,

565
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,760
guys, nudge day, nudge day.

566
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,600
Guys, nudge day, nudge day.

567
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,420
Guys, nudge day, nudge day.

568
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,740
When I worked at the coffee shop that was also a restaurant,

569
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,620
you could have like one meal while you were working.

570
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,140
But the benefit was you made the meal yourself,

571
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,620
so you could just go off menu and be like,

572
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,860
yeah, I had a sandwich stuffed with french fries and stuff.

573
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,940
And you would just put whatever you wanted to into your meal

574
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,860
and you'd just end up with like a plate piled with food

575
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,700
that was free.

576
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
There's that nasty air conditioner again.

577
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,220
When I was at Travis, turn the air conditioner off.

578
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
Please turn the air, oh, you can't, you're strapped in.

579
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,320
Wait, this is a fun little folk game we've got now.

580
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,420
It's like the Maypole.

581
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,740
Can Travis get to the air conditioner?

582
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,180
I can just unhook the lav.

583
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

584
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,840
Nope, don't you dare.

585
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Don't you dare unplug from-

586
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,780
I'm gonna pull my Zoom off the thing.

587
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,620
Come on, don't pull it off.

588
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,440
I'm gonna try it.

589
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
Do it, Travis.

590
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,120
It's right there.

591
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,960
You're right there.

592
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,780
Yeah, it's right there, just turn the fan off.

593
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,620
God, this is like gravity.

594
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
There we go.

595
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
I've done it.

596
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,340
When I was at, oh God.

597
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,300
When I was at Target-

598
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,260
They sweep in the hallway?

599
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,300
I was at Target the night before

600
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,540
we went on the JoCo cruise.

601
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,860
And as I'm at Target and I'm taking Charlie up

602
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,340
to get a juice, we don't let her have juice a lot

603
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,620
because it's made of fruit

604
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,060
and we all know how that is for you.

605
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
Yeah.

606
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,580
And as I was going up to the juice,

607
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,380
I saw a lady who worked at Target

608
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,580
eating a single hot dog on a plate

609
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,180
because I think that was the Target meal

610
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,980
and she was just flipping through pictures of her baby

611
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,300
while she ate a hot dog.

612
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,120
That's nice.

613
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,960
And I was like, that's nice.

614
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,180
That seems really nice.

615
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,380
And then later she checked me out and I was like,

616
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
I didn't want to-

617
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,620
She was like, hey, good looking, what you got cooking?

618
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,440
I didn't want to mention it.

619
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
That's gotta be jelly

620
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,180
because jam don't shake like that.

621
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,380
I saw you eating a hot dog and I wanted to say like,

622
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,900
hey, did you like your hot dog?

623
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,740
Was that a good hot dog?

624
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,020
But I feel like there's some-

625
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,240
Wait, you wouldn't say that to any other human being ever.

626
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,080
So why would you do that to the person at Target?

627
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,340
But I knew that she had just enjoyed a hot dog.

628
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,300
Yeah.

629
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,420
What's better, Dustin,

630
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,900
her eating a hot dog and flipping pictures of her baby

631
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,460
or her holding her baby and flipping pictures of hot dogs?

632
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,020
Okay, we've solved this one.

633
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,160
Yeah, how about a Yahoo?

634
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah.

635
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,820
This one was sent in by Drew Campbell.

636
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,660
Thank you, Drew.

637
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,480
It's Yahoo Answers user.

638
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,900
Sorry, something's gone wrong, but we'll call him.

639
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,740
Jerm.

640
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,580
Jerm.

641
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,780
I just realized I could stand like Seth Rometelli does.

642
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,340
Oh yeah, you got that Seth Rowe style.

643
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,500
This one was asked by Jerms.

644
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,340
All right, that's over with.

645
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,460
Well, that was fun.

646
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,300
Time to sit back down.

647
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,980
Jerms asks, do you like people generally

648
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,580
or would you rather kick some butt?

649
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:59,380
It's in the new Predator movie, that's the first scene, one Predator says to another one, hey, do you like people generally or do you want to kick some butt?

650
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,860
I mean, I think this is something that the big beefcake,

651
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,020
the big beefcakes say to each other, like, I just don't like people.

652
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,220
I'd rather kick some butt.

653
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,700
I just don't like people generally.

654
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,540
Generally speaking.

655
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,380
Generally speaking.

656
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,740
Show me 10 people, I will dislike at least six of them.

657
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,940
And the other four, I'll kick their butts.

658
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,780
Or, wait.

659
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,460
Do you like people generally or would you rather kick some butt?

660
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,420
This is a tough one, isn't it?

661
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:29,060
Cause like, in today, in today, in today, I look around and I'm like, I'm not, I want to stay, I want to stay positive, right?

662
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,540
And like, accept everybody, all walks of life.

663
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,260
But I also see like more and more people that I think like, I don't like you generally,

664
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,140
and I think I'd rather kick your butt, and I don't advocate violence.

665
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I don't think the two are mutually exclusive.

666
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,580
I like people generally, and I would also like to kick some butt.

667
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
Justin, I'm sorry.

668
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,620
I wish that were true, but I would like to cite a great media precedent for this.

669
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,660
It's the hit film, Street Fighter.

670
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,100
Yeah.

671
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,460
And when they're making Blanca, if I remember correctly, they make him 51% good,

672
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,900
so he doesn't just go around murdering everyone all the time.

673
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,420
Okay.

674
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,860
So that's the question is, do you like people 51%?

675
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,420
So did you recently watch Street Fighter and just think like, boy, I got to think of a way to reference this in the podcast?

676
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,380
No, Griffin, I haven't seen it since it first aired in theaters.

677
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,940
That moment just always really stuck with me.

678
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,660
There's one really sick line in Street Fighter's movie when Bison is talking to Chun-Li, I think it is,

679
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:29,780
and he says, the day that M. Bison destroyed your village was the most important day of your life.

680
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,100
To me, it was Tuesday.

681
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,860
It's so rad.

682
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,300
It's like a sick line.

683
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,060
It's a good way to say it.

684
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,780
Did they bring in one, they brought in Shane Black to write, listen, Shane, it's me.

685
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,900
Shane, write this one line.

686
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,700
Write one line about the movie.

687
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,220
I really liked the line where M. Bison's talking to, I think it was Ryu, and he says,

688
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,940
I don't like people generally, I'd rather kick some butt.

689
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,700
Does this mean, does this, okay.

690
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,540
It sounds like Shredder.

691
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,660
It sounds like Master Shredder.

692
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,340
Yeah.

693
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
I don't like people.

694
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,740
I don't like turtles generally, I'd rather kick some butt.

695
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,540
I mean, I've met some nice one, definitely, that I have liked, but like on the whole.

696
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,740
Charlie, by the way, this question's from nine years ago.

697
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:20,780
This was before fucking George W. Bush was president, and people were really,

698
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,020
and he was on his way out, and people were really thinking about kicking some butt.

699
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,140
Charlie says, I like some people, but some people are just a lost cause,

700
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,860
and me thinks that a kick in the butt would not cure them.

701
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,380
Need something much more effective.

702
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,100
Hmm, let me think what we should do.

703
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,620
Charlie.

704
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,340
Kill them, Charlie.

705
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,700
Are you talking about murder, Charlie?

706
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,820
DA Charlie, do you think murder, and also, I think if you ever type the word me thinks,

707
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,780
your computer should explode.

708
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,860
Well, you should have just written me thinks and like Clippy Pops.

709
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,180
I was like, you might be one of the people people dislike generally.

710
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,740
Bye.

711
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,020
We, hi there.

712
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,340
It seems like you're making things worse for everybody.

713
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,060
Do you want to shape up or shape out?

714
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,580
Okay, I have another question here.

715
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
No, no, Justin.

716
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,100
Oh, no.

717
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,220
No, it's time.

718
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,300
It's time for our first Max Fun Drive break.

719
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,700
It's our first Max Fun Drive break.

720
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,900
Take a break now.

721
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,100
Pledge gifts this year.

722
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Well, let's talk about the Max Fun Drive.

723
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,220
So we're on this, I'm going to give you the short version.

724
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,620
We're on a network called Maximum Fun.

725
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
They make a lot of great podcasts.

726
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,900
Been here for seven years.

727
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,380
Been here for seven years.

728
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,260
That's wild, man.

729
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,860
I can't believe that.

730
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,780
They never get rid of us.

731
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,980
And this is a network funded by you, the listeners.

732
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,620
And that's how we pay the bills around here.

733
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,660
We also do advertisements, which you hear on the show,

734
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,300
but those are, those pale in comparison

735
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,180
to what we get from donations from viewers like you.

736
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
This would not run.

737
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,580
And the James L. Knight Foundation.

738
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,380
This would not run on advertising alone.

739
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,540
We need you to support us.

740
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,420
And so at once a year, we come to you and say, hat in hand,

741
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,300
and say, hey, if you like the stuff you're listening to

742
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,500
on the network, please, could you pay a little bit for it?

743
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,700
What does that look like?

744
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Well, we're talking about you pledging a certain amount

745
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,660
that you can afford to pay every month.

746
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,900
If you pledge just $5, you are going

747
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,740
to get exclusive bonus content.

748
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,020
And I'll be honest, at this point,

749
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,060
it is a lot of bonus content.

750
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,860
I mean, it's seven years of my brother, my brother,

751
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,900
and me bonus content.

752
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,820
Three of Adventure Zone.

753
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
There's videos.

754
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,100
There's an exclusive clip from our CISO show

755
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,420
that you can't find anywhere else.

756
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,980
There is?

757
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,900
Yeah, I set that up.

758
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,100
It's like an exclusive clip from the CISO show.

759
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,260
It's Chiccarelli before the teens.

760
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,540
Oh, fuck me, that's good stuff.

761
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,220
And you get all that, plus episodes

762
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,460
of all the other shows.

763
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,380
Every show on the network does a bonus episode.

764
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,140
There's tons of great stuff.

765
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,500
Sidney and I, for our show Sawbones this year,

766
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,300
did just an hour about goop.

767
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,100
Just talked about goop for an hour.

768
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
The Gwyneth Paltrow thing?

769
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,420
Yes.

770
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,740
Oh, man.

771
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,020
That sounds like a required list.

772
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,900
Well, let's write it down then.

773
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,500
My brother, my brother, and me, we did Your Three Dads,

774
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,780
an episode about us being dad.

775
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,060
OK, no, just full transparency.

776
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,780
Did you see the art that I made for Your Three Dads,

777
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,180
by the way?

778
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,660
No.

779
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,100
It's really very good stuff.

780
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Full transparency, it's the worst of the bonus

781
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,060
content of this year.

782
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,100
Oh, it's so bad.

783
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,220
It was a pit for us to pour sort of our fatherly exhaustion

784
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,700
into just a big cup full of our very tired brew.

785
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,620
A lot of gadgets.

786
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,900
For Rose Buddies, we talked to The Bachelorette Canada.

787
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Jasmine Lorimer did an interview with her about life

788
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,180
after being The Bachelorette.

789
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,740
That was really, really fun.

790
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,620
For Schmanners, we watched and reviewed

791
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,860
series five of Great British Bake Off.

792
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,580
Oh, nice.

793
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,500
Ooh, nice.

794
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,260
Trends like these.

795
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,060
The whole series?

796
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,980
What a bargain.

797
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,220
We talked about the trends from 1900 to 1920.

798
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,060
If times are tight, we fucking totally, totally get it.

799
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,140
And really, we don't.

800
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,340
There are people who are like, I can only do $5 a month.

801
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,100
That's awesome.

802
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,780
Just the fact that you would support us in that way

803
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,660
is incredible.

804
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,940
And we don't care how much you give.

805
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,380
It's just I was a supporter of the network

806
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,300
before we were on the network.

807
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,420
And it was just because I was a big JJ Go fan.

808
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,700
And I just wanted to be a supporter of this thing

809
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,500
that I really liked.

810
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,460
And it felt really good.

811
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,300
And so if you listen to our shows

812
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,820
and you want to feel some ownership

813
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,380
over this really cool thing that we've all made together,

814
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,620
then this is the way to do it.

815
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,500
Just a couple others.

816
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,660
And we'll talk about more later.

817
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,180
But if you can pledge $10, you're

818
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,620
going to get a drive-exclusive enamel pin

819
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,340
designed by Megan Lencott.

820
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,060
If you've ever seen the, I think it was a calendar,

821
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,220
but designs of all the Max Fun Shows as cats.

822
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,060
This is this.

823
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,660
And last year was the bandanas with the individual designs

824
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,140
on them.

825
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah.

826
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,220
This year, we've got cool pins.

827
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,740
For $20.

828
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,820
For Mip and Bam, it's a snake that says Zag on them.

829
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,620
It's really good.

830
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,660
It's fucking sweet.

831
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
There's a Keep in Touch kit at $20.

832
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,100
You get the other stuff, plus custom note cards and envelopes

833
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,420
and a four-color rocket pin, a rocket stamp,

834
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,300
a rocket-shaped candle that smells like sharpened pencil,

835
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,620
friendship, and a little bit of wax because it's a candle.

836
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,420
Those are $20.

837
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,100
And if you're already a donor, first off, thank you.

838
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,900
Secondly, you can get these gifts

839
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,700
if you just upgrade to the next level.

840
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,900
So if you're a $5 member right now, upgraded $10,

841
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,700
you're going to get.

842
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,180
And if you become a $20 donor, you

843
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,220
get the gifts at $10 and $5.

844
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,660
And it all stacks up.

845
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,020
But also, our goal for this time, for this go-ground,

846
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,580
is 10,000, which I'd say is.

847
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,100
New donors, not dollars.

848
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,900
Yeah, 10,000 new and upgrading donors.

849
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,500
I shit $10,000.

850
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,060
And it's a pretty ambitious goal,

851
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,940
but we more or less hit it last year.

852
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,700
Last year, we were like 9,800.

853
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
Let's do it.

854
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,060
So let's do it.

855
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,820
There's a bunch of new shows on the network,

856
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,980
and I'm optimistic we can get the Rosebuddies.

857
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,180
This is Rosebuddies' first year.

858
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,100
And we do a lot of shows, and we get a lot of people who ask us,

859
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,740
how do you guys do so much stuff?

860
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,620
The answer to that is, we are able to make a career out

861
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,180
of it because of the donations we get from the next one.

862
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,860
Your money also goes straight to the shows

863
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,020
that you listen to.

864
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,340
Yeah, you choose the shows you listen

865
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,300
to, what you want to support.

866
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,620
Right, and a portion goes to MaxFun,

867
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,860
and the rest of it is just split up among those shows.

868
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,580
So you're directly supporting shows

869
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,340
by saying you listen to them.

870
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,580
We'll talk more about this in a bit, but for right now,

871
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,220
go to MaximumFun.org and click Donate.

872
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,220
That's MaximumFun.org.

873
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,420
And click on Donate, choose the membership level

874
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,260
that's right for you, give them your credit card

875
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,780
and other basic information, and just like that,

876
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,660
you'll be a member.

877
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,420
But if you become a new and upgrading donor,

878
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,100
new or upgrading donor, make sure to let us know.

879
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,060
Tweet at us, put it in our Facebook group, something,

880
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,780
so we can say thank you.

881
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,660
And get involved.

882
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,140
There's going to be this.

883
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,940
Jesus, Travis, that sounds like a lot of work.

884
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,500
Travis will certainly say thank you.

885
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,220
Yeah, one of our many underlings will do it.

886
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,500
We'll make our babies do it.

887
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,100
I'm going to have my social media manager.

888
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,980
Also, there's going to be MaxFun Meetup Days,

889
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,100
and special events, and live events.

890
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
There's a ton of stuff.

891
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,940
Support stuff you love.

892
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,580
OK, another question here from, well, I'll tell you in a second.

893
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,820
Yeah, we'll get there.

894
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,300
We'll get there.

895
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,940
Don't rush me.

896
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,900
I've never been very social at work

897
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,620
outside my immediate team members.

898
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,060
Today, while walking down the hall,

899
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,420
two guys pointed me out with an audible, hey, it's that guy.

900
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,100
I have never spoken to either of these men

901
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,940
outside a courtesy nod in passing,

902
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,380
and do not even know their names.

903
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,860
How should I take this address?

904
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,900
Oh, man.

905
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,300
What could have labeled me as that guy, and how can I own it?

906
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,100
And that's from that guy in that office.

907
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,860
Something bad.

908
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,700
It's not good, right?

909
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,500
I think we can all agree this is not good.

910
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,340
It's not good.

911
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,100
This is something that would really eat at me.

912
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,340
If I was just walking down the street,

913
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,980
and somebody just randomly went, hey, hey, it's that guy,

914
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,380
and kept going, I'd be like, what do you mean?

915
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,140
What?

916
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,700
What do you mean?

917
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,340
What are you saying?

918
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,700
And I think that would live with me for 20 years.

919
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,140
I got to ask, and this is a tough question,

920
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,060
and you may not be ready to answer right now.

921
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,260
And if you're not, that's fine.

922
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,700
And if the answer is yes, then no judgment.

923
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,420
But are you Numa Numa?

924
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,780
Are you the Numa Numa guy?

925
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,460
Hey, are you the Numa Numa guy?

926
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,580
Is there a way to search for yourself to make sure you're not

927
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,180
a meme?

928
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,820
I'm going to search.

929
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,100
That's the thing, these days, everybody

930
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,580
can be everybody's memes.

931
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,820
I mean, somewhere there's a meme for every human being.

932
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,860
The snake ate its own tail.

933
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,820
Drew Scanlan, a guy I know, a giant bomb.

934
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,340
Oh my god, he's the biggest meme in the universe.

935
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,020
Have you seen the guy blinking?

936
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,060
That's Drew Scanlan.

937
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,780
He works at Giant Bomb.

938
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,380
It's from one of the Giant Bomb videos.

939
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,300
And it was like, oh no, memes are happening to real people

940
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,820
now.

941
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,940
They're not just made up people.

942
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,020
Real people are being memed.

943
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
Everybody's being memed all the time.

944
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,140
Be careful.

945
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,100
Maybe you're a meme, and you don't even know it yet.

946
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
And the thing is, when you become a meme,

947
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,580
you can't take that back.

948
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,460
You can't un-meme yourself.

949
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,180
Maybe they were just saying it randomly.

950
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,100
You know, like, just being weird.

951
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Sometimes people just do weird stuff.

952
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,380
Yeah.

953
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,940
You know that one scene in Austin Powers?

954
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,300
Uh-huh.

955
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,380
It's early in the movie.

956
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,380
And Austin's like, there you are.

957
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,860
And you can do that better.

958
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,340
There you are.

959
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,780
You can do that way better.

960
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,940
That's what I'm saying.

961
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,460
There you are.

962
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,260
There you are.

963
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,060
Yeah, baby.

964
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,860
You're doing this like.

965
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,060
I mean, it's hard to do, like, three words at the same time.

966
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Hello, there you are.

967
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
It sounds a lot like Austin Powers.

968
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,220
It's me, Austin Powers, isn't it?

969
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
There you are.

970
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,460
Oh, Jim, and he's, me mojo's gone all wanky.

971
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,980
Let me finish my point.

972
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,620
So Austin's like, there you are.

973
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,060
Like, that's better.

974
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,740
And the woman's like, do I know you?

975
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,220
And he's like, no, but that's where you are.

976
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,780
You're there.

977
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,300
And, um.

978
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,460
Fuck, that's funny.

979
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,140
So the thing I wanted to make, the point I was trying

980
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,100
to make with that is, don't you think

981
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,020
we should make another Austin Powers movie?

982
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,820
OK, listen.

983
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,540
We're finally all in a room together.

984
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,460
We've got some time on our hands.

985
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,980
Yeah, I'm shutting my computer.

986
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,020
We're going to pitch Austin Powers 4 right now.

987
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,580
This is our backdoor pilot for Austin Powers 4.

988
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,060
OK.

989
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,980
We've got to get back to basics.

990
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,340
It's got to be Son of Austin Powers.

991
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,940
It's got to have a son.

992
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,340
Got to have a son.

993
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,740
Got to have a son.

994
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,340
Got to have a son.

995
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah.

996
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,100
Who's the son of Austin Powers?

997
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,740
He's a teen.

998
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,340
Justin Bieber.

999
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,900
Eddie Redmayne.

1000
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,220
No.

1001
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,580
No.

1002
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,260
No.

1003
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,940
Ooh.

1004
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,540
Yeah, you jumped on my Eddie Redmayne.

1005
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,900
Eddie Redmayne is very good.

1006
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,420
OK, we've got to do Time Travel, right?

1007
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,500
It's Austin Powers' son from the future, he just had a baby.

1008
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,300
We're not Time Traveling.

1009
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,540
No.

1010
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,100
He's got a son.

1011
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,580
He's dealing with a son.

1012
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,900
Time Traveled in every one of them, Justin.

1013
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,460
Not in this one.

1014
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,220
I know, but not this one.

1015
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,900
This one's called Austin Powers Back Number Two Basics.

1016
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,660
I want to keep it real.

1017
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,500
It's Mike Myers Day.

1018
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,460
He's a 70-year-old man, and he had a son.

1019
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,780
And maybe he's a grandpa.

1020
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,700
Maybe his son's about to have a son.

1021
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,860
Michael Caine is back in it.

1022
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,540
Michael Caine's back in it.

1023
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,780
Michael Caine's dead as disco.

1024
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,500
There's no way in this world Austin Powers.

1025
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,540
Wait, hold on.

1026
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,740
Don't just spring that on me.

1027
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,700
Michael Caine's not actually dead, right?

1028
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,460
What Justin is saying is Michael Caine is alive now,

1029
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,740
but there's no way he outlives the next Austin Powers.

1030
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,180
Austin Powers is 70.

1031
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,220
Then we Jedi ghost him in it.

1032
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,420
We definitely need a Michael Caine Jedi ghost scene.

1033
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:39,700
Now.

1034
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,060
Record it today.

1035
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,660
Right now, there's a movie executive at,

1036
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,420
who owns these rights?

1037
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,940
Paramount.

1038
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,460
Paramount.

1039
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,820
There's a movie executive at Paramount,

1040
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,300
hearing this right now, and saying to himself,

1041
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,500
oh, this is going to be great.

1042
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,580
What we're going to do?

1043
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,340
We're going to CGI Mike Myers to make him play his own son.

1044
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,840
No.

1045
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,340
No.

1046
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,060
No, listen to me.

1047
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,780
That's wrong.

1048
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,020
Don't chase that.

1049
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,580
It's real.

1050
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,620
It's Eddie Redmayne.

1051
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,260
As his son, and he's at school, or-

1052
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,980
Is he training?

1053
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,740
Maybe he's training.

1054
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,540
Maybe he's a DJ, and he's not in the spy life.

1055
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,620
But for some reason-

1056
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,100
Oh, fuck.

1057
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,940
Oh, Austin Powers has been kidnapped.

1058
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,740
Austin Powers has been ki- OK.

1059
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,780
Austin Powers.

1060
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,540
OK.

1061
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,180
Dr. Evil set a trap 30 years ago for Austin Powers,

1062
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,220
and it's a trap just for Austin Powers.

1063
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,380
And the thing is, they stole Felicity Shagwell,

1064
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,020
and locked her in a trap that only Austin can access.

1065
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Except, Austin's been captured by another villain that's

1066
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,180
competing with Dr. Evil, OK?

1067
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,660
Austin Powers Jr. has enough of- they

1068
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,900
theorize- the Basel Exposition theorizes

1069
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,900
that Austin Powers Jr. will have enough of Austin's DNA,

1070
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,620
or genetic material, to break into the facility

1071
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,300
that only Austin could access, because it's DNA,

1072
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,740
to rescue Felicity Shagwell.

1073
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,220
And the two of them will rescue Austin Powers together.

1074
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,460
And she's got to like, you know, your dad's not as bad as.

1075
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,260
Yeah.

1076
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,980
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1077
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,140
Here's what I like about this.

1078
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,020
No humor.

1079
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,820
No jokes.

1080
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,620
No jokes.

1081
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,420
No jokes.

1082
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,020
This is a very dark, gritty reboot.

1083
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,740
The competing-

1084
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
No, it's not dark and gritty, guys.

1085
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,700
I want to get this made.

1086
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,220
I'm tired of us pitching a bunch of fart ideas

1087
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,180
that don't get made.

1088
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,740
And we always get gritty reboots.

1089
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,420
Gritty this, gritty this.

1090
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,500
I want to make Austin Powers 4.

1091
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,420
It's not a gritty reboot.

1092
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,500
It's just like a really in-depth, like, deep dive

1093
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,860
into, like, family and stuff like that.

1094
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,660
And let me take it one step further.

1095
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,540
The competing villain, that's Scott Evil.

1096
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,140
This Scott Evil is now turning like he's got his whole-

1097
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,180
Austin Powers colon generations.

1098
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,980
Yeah.

1099
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,780
Yeah.

1100
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,980
This is so good.

1101
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,420
Like father, like son.

1102
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,180
You'll never guess who helps Felicity and Austin Powers

1103
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,100
Jr. rescue Austin from Scott Evil.

1104
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,340
You'll never guess who helps.

1105
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,140
Is it Dr. Evil?

1106
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,180
It's Dr. Evil, Travis.

1107
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,980
Dr. Evil.

1108
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,180
That's who helps to get back on top.

1109
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
This is really good.

1110
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,740
Austin Powers colon sins of the father.

1111
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,620
This is good.

1112
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,740
Eddie Raimond is such a fucking good poll for Austin Powers.

1113
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,460
I wish it wasn't a British person.

1114
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,980
But I think that Eddie's probably-

1115
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,780
Well, I mean-

1116
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,460
I would also like to find an opportunity.

1117
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,900
Ooh, maybe number two's had a son.

1118
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,500
And it's number three, number four, number eight.

1119
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,780
And just like that, we've lost it.

1120
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,660
Played by Shia LaBeouf.

1121
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,460
Just like that.

1122
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh, OK.

1123
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,780
We're back.

1124
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,580
Yep.

1125
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,780
I thought I'd get you in there.

1126
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,340
Shia LaBeouf movie son.

1127
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,100
I have the perfect person to play Austin.

1128
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,300
Now, Eddie Redmayne is not bad.

1129
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,100
To play Austin?

1130
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,380
I think I have a pretty good idea.

1131
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,980
Yeah, I think America knows the favorite person.

1132
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,260
You're fairly confident you can get Mike?

1133
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,060
Yes.

1134
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,860
Yeah, I think so.

1135
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,060
You think you can get Mike?

1136
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,980
I feel like if you could get Mike, he would have been-

1137
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,460
we would have had this film already, right?

1138
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,340
Mike Myers has a second cell phone like a drug dealer

1139
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,180
because he does not want to be on his real phone making

1140
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,220
a call and missed the one from Paramount

1141
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,620
asking him to be Mike Myers.

1142
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,420
Can I hit you guys with this for Austin Powers Jr.?

1143
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,220
Uh-huh.

1144
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,580
Adam Devine from Workaholics.

1145
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,380
Oh, my god.

1146
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,180
OK.

1147
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,980
Think about it.

1148
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,020
That's really, really, really, really it.

1149
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,820
That's it.

1150
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,620
That's it.

1151
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,420
Perfect.

1152
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,220
Justin, let me edit this.

1153
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,660
First off, the guy's fucking hysterical.

1154
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,420
He makes you laugh all the time.

1155
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,660
So we don't need to write jokes in our movie.

1156
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,940
You'll just be funny.

1157
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,540
Can I throw a little bit of spaghetti at the wall?

1158
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,660
A little bit of comedy spaghetti.

1159
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
You guys tell me what you think.

1160
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,460
Yeah.

1161
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,700
We do a small crossover scene with the master of disguise

1162
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,900
as played by Dana Carp.

1163
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
OK.

1164
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,100
So you're getting a little deep into that.

1165
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,260
Because I want, I think if there's a scene,

1166
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,220
OK, maybe this is it.

1167
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,060
Because I just want a tiny, tiny scene of like Austin

1168
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,940
in the prison where he's been captured

1169
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,420
and the guy in the cell next to him is Dana Carvey.

1170
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,100
But something for the fans.

1171
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,540
Something where it's like, oh, they're back together.

1172
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,340
We're not worthy.

1173
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,500
Yeah, we're not worthy.

1174
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,060
I love that.

1175
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,100
Oh, and maybe there's a thing where someone says literally,

1176
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,900
we're not worthy.

1177
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,700
He's a big fan.

1178
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,940
Can I suggest one other name for Austin Powers?

1179
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,420
What about Kristen Schaal as Austin Powers, Jr.?

1180
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,940
Austin is, could go either way as a name.

1181
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,740
He had a daughter.

1182
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,180
She's not in the life.

1183
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,820
But now she is.

1184
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,540
Austin Powers, Jr. is Kristen Schaal.

1185
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm just saying that's another option.

1186
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,860
That would be fucking really good, too.

1187
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,940
I would also like to have Kate McKinnon in there somewhere,

1188
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,820
just because I've been trying to find a project to work with

1189
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,140
her on.

1190
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,740
Yeah, I'd love to work with her.

1191
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,420
You know she's going to be Miss Frizzle in the new.

1192
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,220
I do know that.

1193
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,020
What?

1194
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,820
I do know that.

1195
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,620
OK.

1196
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,020
Were we recording a podcast?

1197
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,220
Yeah, I think that's about enough.

1198
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I forgot what we were doing.

1199
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,820
So anyway, in closing, give us some money to do this.

1200
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,220
I think we were doing a question, weren't we?

1201
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,020
Yeah.

1202
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,220
How could it be that guy?

1203
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,020
No, we got it.

1204
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,820
We did it.

1205
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,620
OK.

1206
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
That's how you beat that guy.

1207
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,420
You're the guy who got Austin Powers, Jr. made.

1208
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,820
Austin Powers, Jr. off the ground.

1209
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,020
Why don't you read another one?

1210
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
OK.

1211
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,520
I'm also finally doing Austin Powers,

1212
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,720
4 instead of like an HBO series, rather than just doing,

1213
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,820
I think there's too much to be told in one movie.

1214
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,020
I think we can make it a series.

1215
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,820
I'm just saying.

1216
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,220
It would be nice if it was a series,

1217
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,820
because then otherwise my three-pack Blu-ray collector's

1218
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,420
Criterion edition of Austin Powers would,

1219
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,220
like it won't feel so shameful if it's a TV series next to that.

1220
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,620
If this is a fourth movie, what, am I going to buy a new box?

1221
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,620
It just doesn't make sense.

1222
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,620
You get duct taped on.

1223
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,820
I was doing some chores with my girlfriend at her apartment

1224
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,520
the other day and noticed something peculiar.

1225
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,820
While she was washing dishes, she

1226
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,420
would scrub them with a sponge, shake them off,

1227
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,520
and set them out to dry.

1228
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,320
Wait, what?

1229
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
She would scrub them with a sponge.

1230
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,020
Yes.

1231
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,420
Shake them off.

1232
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,020
Yeah.

1233
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,520
And then set them out to dry.

1234
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,920
She does not rinse her dishes.

1235
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
I love this woman more than anything,

1236
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,220
and I don't know how to lovingly say that she

1237
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,820
isn't finishing her dish job.

1238
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,120
We plan on moving in together later this year,

1239
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,620
and I can't imagine eating off soapy dishes

1240
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,420
for the rest of our lives.

1241
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Please help.

1242
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,020
Well, let me, that's from Sudsy near Seattle.

1243
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,320
Let me say this first off.

1244
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,520
That's obviously utterly baffling human behavior.

1245
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,720
But one thing we should understand going into this

1246
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,920
is that, I don't know if this question answer is a man

1247
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
or a woman or a non-binary person,

1248
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,820
it doesn't really matter.

1249
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,920
Telling your partner they don't wash the dishes good

1250
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,820
is never going to be good optics.

1251
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,420
It's just never going to be.

1252
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,520
Do you want to wash the dishes by yourself forever?

1253
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,720
Because this is a good way.

1254
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,120
Oh, shit.

1255
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,420
It's a honey pot.

1256
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,720
This is a honey pot.

1257
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,420
I've been working for the last nine years with my wife

1258
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,420
to get her to just not make me fill the dishwasher anymore.

1259
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,520
But I'm like, I don't know.

1260
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,220
Honey bowls comes with.

1261
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,820
I can't even.

1262
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,720
She's like, just do it better.

1263
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
I'm like, damn it.

1264
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,620
I'll get you next time.

1265
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,220
I'll treat you.

1266
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,420
I'll get you next time, Gadget.

1267
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,020
My wife still doesn't do it right.

1268
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,920
And there's a right way to do it.

1269
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,620
Oh, I don't do it right.

1270
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,120
Theresa can fit every dish and cup and plate

1271
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,920
and everything we own in one load of dishwasher.

1272
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,120
And I put four bowls in, and somehow it's overcrowded.

1273
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,920
We got this fucking Martha Stewart square dishware.

1274
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,720
And it's just like, it's interlocking.

1275
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,520
It's like fucking tetrominoes and that shit.

1276
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,320
This, she's like actually making it worse in a way.

1277
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,820
Because the food particles, the food particulate,

1278
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,620
if you will, is still there.

1279
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,020
It's still present.

1280
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,620
And now there's soap in the mix.

1281
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,420
But you guys are missing the worst element of this.

1282
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
Your nasty ass sponge.

1283
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,320
The sponge is fucking gross.

1284
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,820
What's wrong with your sponge?

1285
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,620
Well, it touches every bit of everything on the plate, right?

1286
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,820
And then sits still wet, still with shit in it,

1287
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,920
just like out in the open air.

1288
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,320
And then you scrub it again, unless every time,

1289
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,020
unless you do have a dishwasher,

1290
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,420
but you only use it to wash your sponge

1291
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,020
between washing dishes.

1292
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,620
The nightmare.

1293
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,320
You have to buy a new sponge every time.

1294
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,920
You need one.

1295
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,720
Now, I don't, this is funny that we're talking about this.

1296
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,320
Speaking of like different dish procedure,

1297
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,920
I tend to hand wash dishes more.

1298
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,620
We have a dishwasher.

1299
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,920
I tend to hand wash dishes usually

1300
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
because it's like, now I don't have to worry about it.

1301
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,220
I just wash it real quick and then put it up.

1302
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,320
But I lay it out and I don't ever dry it.

1303
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,820
And I mentioned this to,

1304
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,020
I went and got my hair cut by my man, Sonny,

1305
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,020
my dude at MasterCuts, who I've discussed before.

1306
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,120
And he said, oh, I told him this.

1307
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,320
We were discussing dishes for some reason.

1308
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,720
I told him this.

1309
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,220
He said, oh, buddy, nobody dries their dishes.

1310
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,420
It's on TV.

1311
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
If you're on TV, you dry your dishes.

1312
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,620
Nobody dries their dishes, buddy.

1313
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
Who's got time for that?

1314
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,420
I think we all realize that like, the sun dries it

1315
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,320
or whatever, if you just like put it somewhere from now.

1316
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,020
But when he said that about like,

1317
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,320
it's something they do on TV.

1318
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,620
Yeah.

1319
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,320
I started thinking like, no, wait a minute.

1320
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,620
If you watch Dawson's Creek anytime,

1321
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,120
or, and sometimes the OC,

1322
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,620
but anytime in Dawson's Creek the OC.

1323
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,120
Nobody does any chores on the OC ever.

1324
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,120
Anytime the mother character on either of the shows

1325
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,120
is having a conversation, she is chopping vegetables,

1326
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,620
like constantly chopping vegetables.

1327
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,820
And maybe drying dishes is like that.

1328
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,720
It's like, it's weird to just stand in the kitchen

1329
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,620
and have a conversation to like,

1330
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,920
we're inventing this idea of drying your dishes.

1331
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,620
So like, there's some movement in the blocking,

1332
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,820
but it's just a media creation of drying dishes.

1333
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,420
Because we all know if we're sitting and looking at each other,

1334
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,920
dead in the eye, in the dead of night,

1335
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,320
we look at each other, wake up out of dead sleep,

1336
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,520
we look at the other person and say,

1337
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,620
they dry on their own, don't they?

1338
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,120
They do.

1339
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah.

1340
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,520
They do. It's called evaporation.

1341
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,020
Time dries all plates.

1342
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,220
As, as-

1343
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,320
You guys dry, are you guys drying dishes out there?

1344
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:31,620
No.

1345
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,020
The only thing I dry, I do dry one thing.

1346
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,220
It's pots and pans.

1347
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,820
I'll dry pots because they're metal.

1348
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,220
And like, and I've seen like, sheet pans go rusty

1349
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,620
from like, a little bit of moisture caught in like,

1350
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,020
a fold of something, you know, and like-

1351
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,420
See, I got that space age material, dude.

1352
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,820
I got that fucking hydrophobic alloy.

1353
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,920
So I'm not worried about that.

1354
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,620
Also, the problem with pots and pans is they're so big and clunky

1355
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,920
that like, it's hard to find a good place to just stack.

1356
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,220
Anyways, we're getting off topic here.

1357
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,320
How can we help this person?

1358
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,120
What should they do? They can't say anything, right?

1359
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,220
They just have to rinse?

1360
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,420
You gotta rewash at like, at 3 a.m. wake up

1361
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,920
and like, do the fucking like, cobbler's elf shit.

1362
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,720
You could do a thing.

1363
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,220
Okay, you could do this move.

1364
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,920
Honey, I just read the darndest thing.

1365
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,120
Do you know that there are people that rinse their dishes,

1366
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,520
you know, after they scrub them?

1367
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,620
I read in Popular Scientific American that-

1368
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,020
Wash things that's never happened.

1369
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,220
That's just Neil deGrasse Tyson is what you just described.

1370
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
Rinses.

1371
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,520
That rinsing your dishes is actually,

1372
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,920
like, I don't like to rinse them either,

1373
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,520
but apparently it's actually better.

1374
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,520
It makes you smarter like Mozart.

1375
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,320
You know Mozart rinses dishes?

1376
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,220
You know, yeah.

1377
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,320
Pretty weird.

1378
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,120
Can I read a Yahoo?

1379
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,720
Yeah, please.

1380
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,420
Or should we talk more about the Maximum Fun Drive?

1381
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,820
No, read another Yahoo.

1382
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,820
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rose in Game Recognized Game.

1383
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,220
Thank you, Rachel.

1384
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,020
Yahoo answers user, well, this one's just anonymous,

1385
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,720
so I'm gonna call him, Reince, asks,

1386
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,020
do celebrities have to go to school?

1387
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,320
Do celebrities have to go to school?

1388
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,520
Well, no, I know they bring in like the fucking Olsen twins.

1389
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,020
They're like, we'll bring school to you,

1390
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,220
and they bring in a tutor or whatever.

1391
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,320
I have a friend who is in Billboard Dad with the Olsen twins

1392
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,520
and said that they had to like share like a tutor for a day,

1393
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
and it's like, I bet that's not,

1394
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
okay, I want to be very careful with my language here

1395
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,020
because I'm not saying celebrities are dumb

1396
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,020
or anything like that.

1397
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,520
Obviously, Mayim Bialik is like a super genius,

1398
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,020
but I have to think the school they bring to you

1399
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,220
on the set of Billboard Dad isn't very good.

1400
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,420
Well, here's the thing, Griffin.

1401
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,820
Counterpoint, counterpoint, why would it need to be?

1402
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,920
What do you go to school for?

1403
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,120
What do you go to college for?

1404
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,120
To get a job on Billboard Dad.

1405
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,420
To get a job, to get a career.

1406
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,220
Yeah. Yeah.

1407
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,320
Listen, if you've made it to starring in Billboard Dad,

1408
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,020
what career are you worried about getting?

1409
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,620
If you think about it, a lot of people will say like,

1410
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
if you're gonna try to be in entertainment,

1411
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,120
don't have a plan B because it's so hard

1412
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,420
to make it in entertainment that if you have a plan B,

1413
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,620
that's what you're gonna fall back on.

1414
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,220
So maybe if you're already in Billboard Dad,

1415
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,520
like learning how to think is admitting weakness.

1416
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,820
If you learn how to think and what like science is

1417
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,220
and numbers and stuff, you're saying to yourself,

1418
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,720
I might not always be riding this gravy train.

1419
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,320
So maybe you shouldn't, maybe it's like,

1420
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,520
you're setting yourself up for failure

1421
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,360
in the entertainment industry.

1422
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,420
And I like that in your world, Justin,

1423
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,420
the person who's worried about not always riding

1424
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,420
this gravy train is the child actor

1425
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,220
and not who's ever in control of stuff.

1426
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,420
It's just like, I don't want them to learn about reading.

1427
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,820
Like the image I keep coming back to is

1428
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,220
you're on the set of Billboard Dad and the tutor comes

1429
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,420
and goes to the Olsen twins and says,

1430
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,720
what is this shape with the six sides of it?

1431
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,720
And Mary Kate says, well, that there is a rhombus.

1432
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,220
And the teacher says, no, it's not a rhombus, try again.

1433
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,520
And Mary Kate says, I'm Michelle fucking Tanner.

1434
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
It's a rhombus.

1435
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,020
It is a rhombus.

1436
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,120
Do you think, okay, look at the basic point though.

1437
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,020
Do you think that in the day-to-day life

1438
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,620
of the Olsen twins, if one of them misidentified

1439
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,420
a basic shape, anybody's gonna fucking correct them?

1440
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,420
Yeah. How rude.

1441
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,220
No way.

1442
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,520
On the set of Home Alone 2,

1443
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,920
nobody's gonna go to Macaulay Culkin and be like,

1444
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,220
what's 60 times four?

1445
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,120
And he's like- It's 240.

1446
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,020
Yeah, okay. I know it.

1447
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,620
Mr. Math Blaster over there.

1448
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,720
But the question is this, like-

1449
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,520
I think he asked that and Macaulay Culkin

1450
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,220
just throws a wad of $100 bills into his fucking open-

1451
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,820
What's 60 times four?

1452
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,820
He threw a wad of $100 bills into my mouth.

1453
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,220
What the fuck?

1454
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,720
Like if you're Elijah Wood, right?

1455
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,020
And you're filming North and someone's like,

1456
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,320
hey, tell me about this like battle from Civil War.

1457
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,520
You're like, no, I'm starring in North.

1458
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,220
Bye. Bye, I'm in North.

1459
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,920
Bye, Macaulay.

1460
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,320
Hey Macaulay, I'd like to,

1461
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,720
you did the required reading, right?

1462
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,420
You read 1984 and he's just like,

1463
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,220
I'm playing Sonic the Hedgehog,

1464
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,420
Sonic and Knuckles with Michael Jackson right now.

1465
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,620
We're eating Pizza Hut and playing Sonic.

1466
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,820
Can you please fucking get out of my hand?

1467
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,120
I gotta go dangle Elijah Wood out of a tree house.

1468
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,620
That was a documentary, that movie.

1469
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,120
You do, like, you could make the argument

1470
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,820
that if you are famous,

1471
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,720
and that's at last, right?

1472
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,320
Like there's so few people for whom

1473
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,420
they can consistently keep that up their whole lives, right?

1474
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,920
So you can make the argument that if they make you

1475
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,020
go to school when you're famous as a child,

1476
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,520
you're like missing dope shit

1477
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,920
you could be doing everywhere.

1478
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,720
You could be like going to parties.

1479
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,020
I'm not saying, I don't want to be,

1480
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,120
I know celebrity, I know education's important.

1481
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,220
I know that these people work hard to teach these kids.

1482
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,220
I'm just saying, I don't know how you teach

1483
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,120
what is essentially a god.

1484
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
That's the thing is I'm not saying

1485
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
all celebrities are dumb.

1486
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,020
I'm saying if I were a child celebrity,

1487
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,720
you couldn't get me to read.

1488
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,820
You could not get me to learn.

1489
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,720
I would hire eight people to read scripts to me.

1490
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,420
Well, okay, but like normal kids

1491
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,320
don't have to learn about like

1492
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
how to retain as many points as possible

1493
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,820
on the back end of the international distribution rights,

1494
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,320
which like the old students have to,

1495
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
it's just a different, it's a different education,

1496
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,220
it's a different intelligence.

1497
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,520
They're getting the street smarts.

1498
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,120
They get, but like if the street is

1499
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,620
Hollywood Boulevard smarts.

1500
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,120
I bet you Mara Wilson paid a lot of attention

1501
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,820
and like really liked learning from her teachers.

1502
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,620
Well, Mara Wilson is in fact a genius.

1503
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,520
Yeah, I know, I know.

1504
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,120
If I was a genius, I could probably be

1505
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,720
like a child actor and smart too.

1506
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,020
Yeah, I don't want to paint with too broad a brush

1507
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,820
is what I'm saying.

1508
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,820
But I'm saying back in time, okay,

1509
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,120
let's travel back to the 1700s, right?

1510
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,320
You were apprenticed to a printmaker.

1511
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,720
There weren't people there like, okay,

1512
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,420
but also we need you to learn about baking and shit.

1513
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,120
That's what I'm saying.

1514
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
You had the one job and you were happy with it.

1515
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,420
If you're a child star, you have apprenticed.

1516
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,620
You have your job, your career path is set.

1517
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,320
It's like romance education is a modern contrivance.

1518
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,720
Like you don't need to know all this stuff.

1519
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,820
We're breaking down some shit on this episode.

1520
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,820
Why can't we go back to a day where if someone's like,

1521
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
can you balance your checkbook?

1522
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,120
And you're like, no, I was in Star Trek.

1523
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,520
Like, yeah, obviously my job is being in Star Trek.

1524
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,220
Your job is to balance my checkbook.

1525
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,020
Everybody wins.

1526
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm a job creator.

1527
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,320
That's the problem with the economy now.

1528
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,020
Too many people getting into other, like I do my own taxes.

1529
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,520
No, you shouldn't do your,

1530
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,120
you should pay someone else to do your taxes

1531
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,520
because that's their job.

1532
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,920
They also need money.

1533
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,520
Why are you taking money away from people

1534
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,020
who know how to do your taxes?

1535
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,520
Yeah, learning too much is just hurting the economy.

1536
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,220
This is true.

1537
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
We're saying some stuff.

1538
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,220
We're getting there.

1539
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,220
We're saying some stuff on this one.

1540
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,520
You know another way of getting close to the truth

1541
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,820
and that's to donate to the Maximum Fun Drive.

1542
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,720
The Maximum Fun Drive is going on right now.

1543
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,620
If you go to MaximumFun.org,

1544
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,420
click that donate button and just help us out for five,

1545
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,120
just five bucks a month.

1546
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,520
You're going to get oodles upon oodles of noodles.

1547
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,820
You're going to get noodles delivered directly to you.

1548
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,620
Still hot.

1549
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,620
How do they do it?

1550
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:49,520
At a $10, oh, we didn't touch on this one, 35 bucks.

1551
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,020
Yes.

1552
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
You can spare 35 bucks.

1553
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,120
I know that's a chunk of change,

1554
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,220
but maybe you can spare.

1555
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,920
Maybe you listen to like a lot of shows.

1556
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,520
We hear from people a lot where they were listening to two shows

1557
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,820
and then within the last year,

1558
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,020
they picked up Still Buffering and Rose Buddies and Schmanders

1559
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,720
and they think I'm going to listen to a lot more shows.

1560
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,220
I should up my donation.

1561
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,120
If you can get to 35 bucks a month,

1562
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,520
you're going to get the stuff we already talked about,

1563
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,220
the bonus content, the enamel pin, the keep in touch kit.

1564
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,920
You're also going to need a pair of rocket engraved beer mugs,

1565
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,720
which that's going to make your frosty bruise go down real nice.

1566
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,020
Yeah.

1567
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,620
If you can say-

1568
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,920
Time to blast off to adventure in drinking.

1569
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,220
You can put anything there.

1570
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,920
You don't got to be alcoholic.

1571
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,620
You could have a root beer float in those mugs.

1572
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,120
Yeah.

1573
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,420
Or treat yourself.

1574
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,320
This is the way, these drives are the way that like,

1575
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,220
like we don't like asking for money,

1576
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,820
but we do like the idea.

1577
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,520
Well, Travis does.

1578
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:42,820
I do.

1579
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,220
I wasn't going to say it, but I love asking for money.

1580
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,120
We don't, we don't, broadly speaking, like asking for money,

1581
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,220
but we do, the thing that I really like,

1582
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,020
the reason I don't feel bad about the Max Fund Drive is that

1583
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:59,020
I really do believe it's worth paying for the stuff that you like.

1584
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,120
And we are in the way that media has sort of diversified.

1585
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,220
You can find stuff that's much more niche than you used to be able to,

1586
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,120
but you have to, you have to be the one to support that stuff

1587
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,520
and you have to be the one who says I like this.

1588
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,620
I want more of it because there isn't that broad,

1589
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,320
you know, media buy, you know,

1590
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,120
like Gillette isn't buying a bunch of ads to keep their shows running.

1591
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,420
Like we rely on the people who like the stuff to pay for it.

1592
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,920
And I, we really do, it really does mean a lot.

1593
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,320
When it comes down to it, we don't miss episodes.

1594
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,920
Like we work as hard as we can to not miss episodes

1595
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,820
because we know that there are people out there supporting us

1596
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,020
who, who love the things that we made and look forward to it every week.

1597
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,320
And they're supporting us and like, it means a lot to us.

1598
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,520
And so like, it's, it's a job for us.

1599
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,220
It's also a passion for us.

1600
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,020
We work really hard.

1601
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,820
Well, I, I think I only really work really hard on Adventure Zone,

1602
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,120
but the other ones I do work some on.

1603
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,020
Well, we work hard to write the scripts for my brother, my brother and me.

1604
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,820
Yeah, sure.

1605
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,720
That's hours and hours every day.

1606
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,820
And to pay the writers.

1607
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,120
Yeah.

1608
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:02,820
And to pay the writers.

1609
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,920
To pay for certain ain't cheap.

1610
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,320
Yeah.

1611
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,720
And so I think what's, I think what's important,

1612
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,020
I think what's really, sorry, I'm going to take this one again.

1613
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,120
This is like, this is confusing.

1614
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,320
Hey, Jerry, what were you thinking with this fucking line, dude?

1615
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,220
Like, how am I, like Jerry Seinfeld, like Jerry,

1616
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,020
Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, when you wrote this line for our script, like,

1617
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,420
what, how did you think I was going to deliver this?

1618
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,820
Fucking, just amateur.

1619
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,720
You're fired, Jerry.

1620
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,820
You're fired, Jerry Seinfeld.

1621
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,820
We have more money than you now because of the Maximum Fun family.

1622
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:37,020
We have a, I think part of the reason our show has, has been,

1623
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,620
and we as people have been successful is that our listeners know

1624
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,620
that we aren't going to speak a bunch of bullshit to them.

1625
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,320
That we tell them the truth.

1626
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,820
I lied about Jerry Seinfeld.

1627
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,220
So here's the truth.

1628
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,320
If you listen to our shows and you like it and you don't pay money

1629
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,820
and you could pay money, you're stealing it.

1630
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:57,720
And you're a thief and you should go to prison forever.

1631
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,020
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1632
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,020
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1633
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,820
Actually, if you do this and you know you have the money

1634
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,320
and you don't give it to us and you could and you want to but don't,

1635
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,220
I think just go surrender yourself to a jail right now.

1636
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,020
And also listen, we're working on the honor system here,

1637
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,820
but it's kind of a reverse honor system where if you have a friend

1638
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,320
that you know to donate $5 a month and they listen to our shows

1639
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,320
and they don't donate $5, you need to take that friend to jail.

1640
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,820
Yeah, you need to send that friend to jail.

1641
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,920
If you know in your heart you could ask Ken Jeong to donate $100 a month

1642
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,420
to Maximum Fun and you don't do it, you're kind of stealing from us in a way.

1643
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,320
Yeah, so both of you should go to, who goes to jail and now?

1644
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,820
Both of them go to jail. It's a prisoner's dilemma. Is that it?

1645
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,120
That's not how it works at all.

1646
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,520
If you don't go to jail, your friend has to go to jail for five years,

1647
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,520
but if you both go to jail, it's two and a half years.

1648
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,320
Don't actually, don't, hey, everybody, before we get off on a bunch of fun stuff.

1649
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,720
Please don't tweet at anybody.

1650
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,620
Don't tweet at Ken Jeong.

1651
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,020
This is a personal journey between you and your wallet and your jail.

1652
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,120
But if you do have a friend who is listening and is stealing it,

1653
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,020
you do owe it to rat them out.

1654
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,420
Yes.

1655
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,220
By which I mean, tell them to donate because we really appreciate you.

1656
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:06,620
Maximumfun.org and then just click donate.

1657
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,320
There's a wide range of levels from $5 all the way up to $200.

1658
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I don't know what you get at $200.

1659
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,420
Oh, you get free registration to Max Fun Con 2018.

1660
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,620
So that's like, hey, hell yeah.

1661
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,120
Hell yeah.

1662
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:18,720
So that's great.

1663
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,620
And for $100, and you also, remember, all of them stack.

1664
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,220
So at $200, you get everything before it.

1665
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,120
At $100, you're in the Inner Circle Culture Club

1666
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,820
where every month you get something sent to you that the hosts

1667
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,120
or people that work at Max Fun have chosen for you.

1668
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,020
We got called up to do that for February for Rose Buddies.

1669
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,620
And we were like, oh, how about this Al Jarreau album

1670
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,620
that me and Rachel like?

1671
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,320
And then he died like that day.

1672
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,820
So I'm just saying we need to be really very careful.

1673
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,320
That's great.

1674
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,820
Anyway, the Culture Club is really fun, but it's also very cursed.

1675
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,220
I actually really like this time of year

1676
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,620
because I get to see everybody sort of saying like,

1677
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,020
hey, it means a lot to see so many people say, hey, what you do

1678
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,820
means something to me.

1679
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,020
And I'm going to show it by kicking you a few bucks.

1680
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,120
It really means the world.

1681
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,520
And even if you can just find it in your heart

1682
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,920
to give us $5 a month, it really does help keep the lights on

1683
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,720
and supports a whole network of people

1684
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,020
that are handling a lot of shit so we don't have to.

1685
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,120
And we really appreciate you doing that.

1686

So maximumfun.org, then click the Donate button.

1687
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,120
I was getting my Munch Squad on at McDonald's breakfast

1688
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
after work.

1689
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,720
When I sat down for my feast, a guy walked in the door,

1690
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,120
looked at me, and said, idiot can't even

1691
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,220
make his own pancakes.

1692
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,920
How pathetic.

1693
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,020
Don't laugh at that.

1694
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,920
I mean, it's a power play.

1695
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:50,120
Simpson was eating breakfast at McDonald's.

1696
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,620
And then they sat down to eat.

1697
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,320
A guy walked in the door, looked at them,

1698
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,620
and said, idiot can't make his own pancakes.

1699
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,520
How pathetic.

1700
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,620
And then walked back out.

1701
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,820
What is this?

1702
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,320
What?

1703
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,620
What is this?

1704
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,620
What is this fucking mysterious assassin?

1705
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,920
I tried to enjoy my meal.

1706
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,520
But all I could taste were dejection and tears.

1707
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,920
How could I track this guy down?

1708
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,120
Explain how restaurants work.

1709
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,920
Project the image of a man who definitely

1710
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
understands the process of making pancakes

1711
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,420
to every stranger I encounter.

1712
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,820
And that's from Hobbs.

1713
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,020
Here's the thing.

1714
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,420
This thing this person did was wrong,

1715
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,720
but also, I think, very funny, maybe, also.

1716
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,220
Because the alternative is you walk into a pizza

1717
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,020
and you're like, all these fucking idiots

1718
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,620
don't know how to make their own pizza.

1719
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,120
Bye.

1720
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,520
Very funny.

1721
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,220
I think a nicer, there's a nicer way of doing this.

1722
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
Here's the nicer, amazing way of doing this.

1723
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,620
Walk into McDonald's, see someone

1724
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,720
eating a stack of pancakes, hand them

1725
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,220
a recipe for pancakes, and then walk out the door.

1726
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,620
That's a sweet way of doing it.

1727
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
You're right, Justin.

1728
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,820
This is the na-bim-bam way of doing it.

1729
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,420
That's a nice way of doing it.

1730
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,320
You walk in and you hand them a recipe for pancakes.

1731
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,120
Still hilarious.

1732
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,520
And you say, for next time.

1733
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,220
For next time, try this.

1734
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:05,920
Go for it.

1735
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,720
And it's fun.

1736
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,620
Hey, it's fun.

1737
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,520
I want to be.

1738
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,920
If you do it wrong, they're crepes.

1739
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,520
It's fine.

1740
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,320
I want to be in the head of the person who's

1741
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,420
walking by McDonald's, sees someone

1742
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,420
eating a stack of flapjacks, and is like,

1743
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,420
I got to go in there and say something.

1744
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,220
I got to get them.

1745
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,620
Fucking double parts.

1746
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,020
Just falls up on the lot of McDonald's,

1747
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,820
and rolls out, Victoria, just go around the block.

1748
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,620
I'm just going to be a sec.

1749
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,820
Oh, but you grabbed me a biscuit.

1750
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,720
No, you don't understand.

1751
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,220
You don't get it.

1752
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,820
You don't get it.

1753
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,320
I'm not getting anything in there.

1754
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,720
No, I think they went in wanting to buy something,

1755
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,820
and then they just had to put this thing up front.

1756
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,720
They have pancakes here.

1757
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,220
You can do this at home.

1758
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,420
OK, but what could?

1759
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,620
OK, pancakes, I think, are very easy to make at home.

1760
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,720
And I think they probably are.

1761
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,320
I've never had restaurant pancakes.

1762
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,020
Deceptively difficult, Justin.

1763
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,320
Well, it's hitting the right pan temperature.

1764
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,020
Come on.

1765
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,220
None of the things that McDonald's will worry about,

1766
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,020
in any way, shape, or form, when they're perfecting it.

1767
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,020
When they're defrosting.

1768
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,020
When they're defrosting.

1769
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,620
Now, it is undeniable that McDonald's

1770
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:11,820
does have dark, arcane breakfast treats that know.

1771
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,420
Like, you tell me how they make that McGriddle.

1772
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,420
Tell me how to make a McGriddle right now.

1773
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,820
With the biscuit, with the syrup nugs.

1774
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,220
They have these magical crystals of syrup that somehow, like.

1775
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,220
A wizard gave them, like a syrup wizard.

1776
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,020
A Canadian syrup wizard.

1777
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,420
A maple witch.

1778
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,620
That's why it was such a big deal when they did breakfast

1779
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,120
all day, because they're burning through the non-renewable

1780
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,620
resource of syrup crystals so fast.

1781
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,820
You've run out of syrup crystals.

1782
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,220
We're running low on syrup crystals.

1783
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,020
We're running low.

1784
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,820
Call the maple witch.

1785
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,120
Listen, I know we try to keep it nice on this show.

1786
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,520
We try to be mean.

1787
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,220
This is maybe the funniest thing I've ever read.

1788
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,020
I'm really trying so hard not to get entertained.

1789
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,220
It's not funny that you got bullied.

1790
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,020
And it's not funny that this person's an ass.

1791
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,220
What's funny is the idea of walking into a restaurant just

1792
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,520
all pre-angry that people here are eating things that they

1793
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,220
could just as easily make at home.

1794
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,020
It's just so good.

1795
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,820
It's so good, though.

1796
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,220
Oh, man.

1797
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,820
Do they walk into auto body shops?

1798
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,020
And they're like, change your own oil, idiots.

1799
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,820
Idiot doesn't even know how to change it.

1800
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,620
Idiot doesn't even know how to do a triple bypass.

1801
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,920
Dumb.

1802
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Wow, it's just very mean, but very funny.

1803
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,520
And I don't think it's even that mean.

1804
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
It's real life trolling.

1805
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,720
It's exactly what it is.

1806
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,220
Yeah.

1807
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,220
Well, then I'm not.

1808
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,920
Now you've ruined it.

1809
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,020
Now I'm not for it anymore.

1810
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:28,920
I don't know.

1811
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,420
It's just, it's just.

1812
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,720
If this happened to me, it would make my fucking week.

1813
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,220
Oh, really?

1814
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,120
It would ruin my life.

1815
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,220
I would be really bummed out.

1816
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,320
If someone did this to you?

1817
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,520
If I went to McDonald's and somebody

1818
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,620
put me on blast for eating pancakes at McDonald's,

1819
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,720
I think I'd feel probably pretty bad.

1820
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,320
Well, let's start with the big problems.

1821
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,720
One, you're eating in the McDonald's.

1822
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,920
Which we've talked about.

1823
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,120
We've talked about, like, yeah, there's

1824
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,520
some problems about eating inside the fast food establishment.

1825
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,320
There's probably.

1826
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,120
Fast food restaurants are, by definition,

1827
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,120
a gun that shoots burgers at you.

1828
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,720
So for you to go inside the gun to retrieve the burgers

1829
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,720
from the dragon's hoard is.

1830
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,420
Would this affect you less if you were, like,

1831
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,720
at an IHOP, Griffin?

1832
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,620
Or, like, some place, like a fancy, IHOP's not fancy.

1833
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,420
I'm trying to think.

1834
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,620
I can't think if there's not, like, if you went to, like.

1835
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:14,120
If a stranger yelled at me about the food I was eating,

1836
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,120
I don't give a fuck.

1837
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:19,520
I don't care if I'm at the Jiro dreams of sushi restaurant.

1838
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,120
Somebody kicks in the door and is, like,

1839
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,320
can't make your own sushi.

1840
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,520
I'm, like, oh, my dinner's ruined.

1841
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,720
Wait, hold on.

1842
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,920
If you were at the fanciest sushi place.

1843
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,520
Jiro dreams of sushi.

1844
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,320
And somebody just walked in and was, like, idiot.

1845
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,920
Can't make his own sushi.

1846
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,120
Your first reaction would be, like, he's right.

1847
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,120
No, my first reaction would be, oh, no.

1848
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,520
A stranger yelled at me.

1849
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,120
How are you not getting that?

1850
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,520
I don't want a stranger to yell at me for any situation

1851
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,920
in any circumstance whatsoever.

1852
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,720
I would like to read the question before.

1853
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,520
It's just a perfect.

1854
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
I think that this question asks that this probably really

1855
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,320
happened in their real life.

1856
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,520
But it's a great TV show episode.

1857
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,020
OK.

1858
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,520
A little while ago, I was messaged

1859
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,120
by someone on a gaming website that they

1860
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,820
lived in the same area as me and were interested in getting

1861
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,820
together to play a local game of Rock Band

1862
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,120
to try and beat the four hour long endless set

1863
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,020
list of all songs in the game.

1864
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,020
I agreed.

1865
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,620
And after we settled on a time to meet up and do this,

1866
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,520
I drove to the address he gave me.

1867
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,920
After sending my location in case

1868
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,720
this was an attempt to lure me into a saw like trap,

1869
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,920
I rang the doorbell only to discover that it was even worse.

1870
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,720
And the guy who invited me was a high school sophomore

1871
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,720
less than half my age.

1872
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,320
To make things more awkward, his mom

1873
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,320
was also there doing weekend cleaning and vacuuming

1874
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,120
the house.

1875
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,320
I stayed and played the entire four hour session.

1876
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,520
Well, yeah.

1877
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,020
But nobody who was there in that house

1878
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,520
acknowledged how awkward and weird this was.

1879
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,920
And when it ended, I quickly gathered my things

1880
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,920
and got away as quickly as I could.

1881
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,720
Could I have done anything to make

1882
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,520
this situation less awkward?

1883
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,420
As a man in his 30s, am I just too old

1884
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,620
to be meeting up to play video games with strangers

1885
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,420
from the internet?

1886
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,720
And that's from Rock Band Regrets in the Pacific

1887
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,920
Northwest.

1888
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,720
Rush more.

1889
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,320
Rush more.

1890
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,320
It's a rush more.

1891
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,120
We got a real life rush more.

1892
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,120
It's a real life rush more.

1893
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,020
You got the opportunity to mold young minds.

1894
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,520
And it's just like, you're just like paradiddle, paradiddle,

1895
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,320
like hitting those drums and playing along

1896
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,520
to the Killers or whatever the fuck's in Rock Band.

1897
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,320
And then you just look at them, you're like, boom, da, da, da.

1898
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,320
So you dating?

1899
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,120
Do, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1900
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,120
You know what the best character in this story is?

1901
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:29,920
It's the mom.

1902
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,520
Yeah.

1903
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,220
The mom who's just cleaning and is like, what's going on?

1904
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,020
What's going on?

1905
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:34,820
OK.

1906
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,820
Well, have fun.

1907
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,620
Does the goosh, does the goosh, does the goosh.

1908
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,320
Have you ever wanted to be a ward?

1909
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,020
If you ever wanted to be somebody's ward,

1910
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,020
you could be my ward.

1911
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,120
Does the goosh, does the goosh.

1912
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Honey, are you going to be that man's ward?

1913
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,820
OK.

1914
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,620
That's fine.

1915
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,420
Just have fun.

1916
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,620
Oh, you're playing Rush?

1917
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,820
That seems fun.

1918
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,120
OK, bye.

1919
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,420
A worse thing has happened to me than this.

1920
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,020
Oops.

1921
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,420
I used to work at a newspaper called The Iron Twin Tribune.

1922
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,820
And we had this feature called The Dart.

1923
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,220
And the way The Dart worked is you

1924
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:03,220
would throw a dart at Lawrence County, where we covered.

1925
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,720
And you would throw a dart at Lawrence.

1926
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,120
And he would try to get out of the way of it.

1927
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,020
Hey, stop it.

1928
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:07,820
Stop it.

1929
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,220
Oh, my face.

1930
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,720
Throw a dart at a map of Lawrence County.

1931
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,220
And you would go to where The Dart landed and find news there.

1932
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:18,220
Lawrence County does not have the density

1933
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,420
to support this concept.

1934
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,520
But we did The Dart every week.

1935
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,920
And I went to this location.

1936
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,220
It was the job everybody hated.

1937
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,720
And we would all fight each other to not have to do it.

1938
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
And I went to The Dart.

1939
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,720
And I walked around this block for about a half hour

1940
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,320
before I finally found two teens sitting on their stoop.

1941
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,620
And they're the only humans I'd encountered.

1942
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,620
So I said, like, well, you guys obviously

1943
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,720
you guys got any news?

1944
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,420
What are you guys doing?

1945
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,420
What's the scoop?

1946
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,020
They were like, well, no, we're not doing anything.

1947
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,220
I was like, um.

1948
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,120
Could you do something?

1949
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,220
What are you about to do?

1950
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,420
And they're like, well, we're going to play DDR.

1951
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,020
And I was like, OK, can I come with you?

1952
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:54,820
Justin.

1953
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,620
Justin.

1954
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,920
Justin Tyler.

1955
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,620
No, I want you to know the feeling

1956
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
that I'm feeling right now is pride.

1957
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,420
It's surprise.

1958
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,220
It's pride.

1959
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,820
I'm feeling pride that Justin approached human beings

1960
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,620
and then invited himself along with them.

1961
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,620
It's part of being a reporter.

1962
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,220
It's why I quit, because I was so bad at it.

1963
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,620
And I was like, are your parents here?

1964
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,020
And they're like, yeah, no problem.

1965
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,420
And I went to their dad, I think.

1966
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,420
I was like, I gave him the whole spiel.

1967
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,420
I was like, I'm just going to watch them play DDR

1968
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,820
and take a couple of pictures and then write about it.

1969
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:24,620
And he's like, OK.

1970
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,920
Did you pitch a headline?

1971
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,220
Did you have a headline to this frickin' news?

1972
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,120
Two boys step right.

1973
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,620
Local teens play DDR as obese man watches

1974
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,220
from fucking Star Wars sheets.

1975
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,920
So I went up and sat on their bunk bed

1976
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,420
and took pictures of these teens playing DDR.

1977
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,820
And like, no one knew when it had been enough.

1978
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,620
Like, I did.

1979
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,220
I kept waiting for the story.

1980
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,020
We got it.

1981
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,520
Right, I kept waiting for something like.

1982
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,420
I would have known.

1983
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,120
Had you invited me along as a sort of assistant,

1984
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,420
I would have been able to tell you this is enough.

1985
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,620
I kept waiting for something newsworthy to happen.

1986
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:05,220
Oh, I did play DDR and it made North Korea change their ways.

1987
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,820
I did one on a corner where there

1988
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,920
was a sign answer for Pizza Hut and a sign

1989
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,120
answer for Domino's on opposite corners.

1990
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,320
See, that's an American This American Life episode.

1991
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
Yeah, that was amazing.

1992
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Called the Pizza Wars.

1993
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,620
I got an Ohio Associated Press Award for that one.

1994
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,520
Fuck yeah, dude.

1995
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Yeah, man.

1996
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,720
I was a prize-winning business reporter back in the day.

1997
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,120
One last time, thank you so much for listening.

1998
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,020
Thank you for all the years of listening.

1999
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,320
Thank you to people who have donated in the past.

2000
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,120
And please, if you're not donating now

2001
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,420
or you could donate a little bit more,

2002
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,720
we ask you to just go to MaximumFun.org

2003
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,120
and click that Donate button and let's just get it rolling.

2004
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,620
And then from now on, when you listen to Max Fun shows,

2005
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,520
you could say, hey, I helped make that.

2006
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,420
I was part of that and I helped make that.

2007
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,420
And it would really mean a lot to us.

2008
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,620
So if you could take the time to do that, $5, $10, $20 a month.

2009
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,720
Yeah, even if you can get in at $5, $5 gets you

2010
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,820
all the bonus content.

2011
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:00,220
And it means that you are a member

2012
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,920
and you support what we do here.

2013
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,020
And we appreciate it so much because of you.

2014
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,520
We are able to grow and do more stuff

2015
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,720
and take time off from our jobs to go make dumb TV shows

2016
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,520
or to fly to Portland and go do live shows there.

2017
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
Or donate it to Fushigi Patronage.

2018
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,320
One of those two.

2019
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,620
One of those two things.

2020
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,920
One of those two equally responsible.

2021
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,520
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

2022
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,220
for using this theme song into Departure off the album,

2023
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,420
Putting the Days to Bed.

2024
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,620
Good dude, good band, good tunes, man.

2025
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,320
Good times.

2026
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,120
Good brews.

2027
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,320
Good brews, good tunes.

2028
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:34,920
Good waves.

2029
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,020
Good dude.

2030
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,520
And yeah, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

2031
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,220
Go check out all the other shows this week.

2032
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,020
That's a fun thing to do.

2033
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,220
If you haven't listened to any other Max Fun shows,

2034
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,420
go try one out this week during Max Fun Drive

2035
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,820
because everybody's doing their best stuff,

2036
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,420
putting their best foot forward.

2037
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,420
Yeah, and be sure to check out the Still Buffering bonus

2038
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,120
episode.

2039
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,520
They did My Sister, My Sister, and Me.

2040
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,920
So for their bonus episode, they're

2041
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,120
taking advice and doing the bim bam thing.

2042
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,120
So that's really fun.

2043
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,420
If you're not listening to that show, you should.

2044
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,820
Yeah, it's awesome.

2045
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,720
You want that final?

2046
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,520
Yeah.

2047
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,420
I also just want to say, thank you.

2048
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,120
Yeah, thank you.

2049
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,020
Max Fun Drive is my favorite time of the year

2050
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,220
because it really, not only is it fun and exciting

2051
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,920
and we do a lot of bonus stuff and there's

2052
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,020
a lot of events and everything, but it also

2053
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,620
is a two-week period where I get to remember,

2054
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:27,520
like be reminded that we wouldn't be where we are.

2055
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,220
We wouldn't have a TV show if it wasn't for support.

2056
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,120
We wouldn't have the opportunities that we've had

2057
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,320
and have come down to being on Max Fun, listeners like you,

2058
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
and support.

2059
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,220
And it just means the world to me.

2060
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,520
And it shows me up every time.

2061
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,220
Every Max Fun Drive, I just feel so lucky

2062
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,320
to be part of this network.

2063
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,820
So thank you.

2064
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,020
Here comes that final.

2065
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,120
And it was sent in by Amelia Berger.

2066
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,920
Thank you, Amelia.

2067
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Help Me Find My Son, who asks,

2068
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,120
is watching Air Bud on a portable DVD player in my car

2069
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,820
too intimate for a first date?

2070
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,820
My name is Joseph McElroy.

2071
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,920
I'm Travis McElroy.

2072
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,820
I'm Griffin McElroy.

2073
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,720
And my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad square

2074
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,320
on the lips.

2075
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:16,320
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?
