1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,720
era. Griffin, don't stop. For God's sake, don't stop. I'm- but my back is so tired. I've been

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,880
shoveling. I've been shoveling all morning and afternoon. But we're so close. Don't stop now,

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,000
Griffin. Hold on, I think I've hit- I've hit the cedar coffin within which- this is gonna sound

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,880
like Justin's dead. He's not dead. No, to let you guys know what's up, um, as a publicity stunt for

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:18,240
the Max Fun Drive, uh, Justin, uh, on his request, uh, was buried alive, um, for a week, um, to help

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
raise awareness of the Max Fun Drive, and now, uh, it's the groundbreaking. We're gonna release

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:32,640
him out back into, uh, Justin. Welcome back. Oh my god. We did it. We did it. We did it, man. Max

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Fun Drive was a huge success. They said it couldn't be done. We did it. You have no idea how many

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,320
people donated and said it was just because of your brave- your brave duplication of David Blaine's

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,480
bravery. Did you- did, um, did a lot of people- were a lot of people- oh, hold on. I'm just trying

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,080
to get my bearings. Were a lot of people, um, moved by it? Is that why they wanted to donate?

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,520
Um, did you- do you have, like, a contact list for the people that you told about being buried? Did

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
you- do you have, like, a- did you make a list of people that you told about being buried alive?

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,320
No, no, you guys were- were telling people that I was- while I was buried alive, and that you were-

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
No, no, you were buried alive. Griffin was digging, and I made the lemonade, and then you

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,920
were supposed to tell everybody. Travis did lemonade. He- look at the list here. This list

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
says lemonade Travis digging Griffin, and then you were buried. I- I was buried! That's, like,

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
the biggest part of the job! I don't know. No, I made a lot of lemonade. I made, like, a week's

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,320
worth of lemonade. What? Okay. Yeah, and I was using a baby sand castle shovel. The last thing I said

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,840
before they nailed the coffin is make sure to have- that seems excessive, didn't it? Big- it was a

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
little bit much. Were we afraid of him getting out? Yeah, yes. Make sure to throw a big charity event

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
and see if Little Richard could come. We did that. Because he really- you were supposed to get Little

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
Richard! He was there, but we didn't tell anybody else. It was basically just me, Griffin, and Little

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Richard. He was really cool, though. He was a really cool guy. He donated. He loves the shows.

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,760
He did five dollars a month. He did five, which, you know what? I think he could probably do a

32
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,160
little bit more, but then again, maybe not. Yeah, he had not a lot of hits lately. Time's been tough.

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,040
For those of you- even though you didn't know- the fact that you guys donated so much,

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,840
and did not know I was locked underneath the earth, is extremely, extremely moving to us,

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,320
and it is- it means the world. And I try to respond to everybody who donated and mentioned

36
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,280
on Twitter. If you didn't- if anyone responded, let me know, and I will personally thank you,

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,320
because you guys are amazing. We crushed our goal, and you really help us to keep the show going. So,

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,440
thank you so, so, so much. You are- You helped Justin face his fear of claustrophobia.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We are not getting into revisionist history here with the stunt.

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,440
This is not a spirit journey for me. I was- this is not a sweat lodge, okay? You- this

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,440
was a boner on your guys' part. You boned it. We boned it. That lemonade was fucking great,

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,880
though. Thank you. Did you say- Travis puts a little cayenne pepper in there,

43
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,320
so while you're drinking- Yeah, just a little bit of kick.

44
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Just a little bit of kick, and while you're drinking it, you're also cleansing.

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,640
It's semester cleanse lemonade. Why would he drink- Hey, let's get to some advice.

46
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,520
Our first question comes to us from our friend- oh, there's no- it's not sourced here.

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,800
Our friend Gmail, the platform. Our friend Gmail platform. I am Gmail platform.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,120
Uh, I'm a single male in my mid-20s. I'm proud whenever I go on a first date with a lovely lady.

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
I consider myself fairly forward-thinking, and I don't feel as though I should pay dinner,

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,840
drinks, the movies, etc., simply because I am a man. Oftentimes, the women I'm dating are equally

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,680
as forward-thinking and offer to split the bill, but sometimes that's not the case. How do I explain

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
that I feel two adults, each gainfully employed, should share expenses without sounding like I

53
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,040
just want to be friends? Now, this isn't the funny answer, but this is the real answer.

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,720
Okay. You're looking at this wrong. How is-

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,760
You're not paying for it because you are a man. You are paying for it because you invited them

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
out. Yeah.

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
You are paying- you are treating them to dinner. It is not- it has nothing to do with a male-female

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,200
relationship. It's the same as if you took a friend out for a birthday or if you took

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,880
a visiting, you know, brother, sister, parent out to dinner. You're taking them out to dinner.

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
That's why you're paying for it. Yeah, and if you invite somebody-

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
if you're looking for- if the question is, like, how do I get a read on the situation?

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,920
I think the right move is to offer, but it's not necessarily, like- for me, at least, dating isn't

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,600
it connotated on who pays. Like, when I go to dinner or lunch with a friend,

64
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,200
we usually- each person will usually offer to pay, and then we'll kind of- I mean, because

65
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
it's like a nice thing to do. I don't think there's necessarily a dating, not dating thing.

66
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,920
I think you offer, and if they say, well, let's split it, like, I think that that is completely-

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,760
I think that that's your sign right there. I think you should always be willing to pay,

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,560
but that doesn't mean you have to, you know, especially on the first date, you know, be

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,320
willing to, and then say, like, you know, this one's on me, with the implication being that

70
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,200
maybe the next time you guys go out, it'll be on her, or, you know, you'll split it the next time,

71
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,360
or once it settles into a groove, and then you don't have to discuss it every time.

72
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,440
You know, Teresa and I, at this point, we've been together two years. We split things and

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,440
each pay for things all the time, but, you know, in the beginning, I paid for things until that

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,920
was kind of established, because it is still, in this day and age, a really hard conversation to

75
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,800
have, to be like, so you're paying, right? You know what really brings a new couple

76
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
together on a first date, though? What's that, what?

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
Dining and dashing. Oh, commit a secret,

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,440
commit a secret little crime. If you think about it, sorry, restaurant workers, listeners of our

79
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,120
podcast, dining and dashing really isn't a crime. It's not a crime. As long as you leave a tip.

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,440
Is it? Yeah, sure. It's as minor a crime as you can commit. So, yeah, just do that,

81
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,960
and you guys will have a fun story for your kids about how you both went to prison.

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,840
That's how Bonnie and Cly got started, though, and we all know how that ended,

83
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,880
with an Oscar-winning movie and glory. Is that what you want? You want to be famous?

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,200
I think you've got to, if you're really having a problem with this, you've got to get on

85
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:51,440
OkCupid. You've got to get on Match.com because it is so codified there that the bill gets split.

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,440
I think it's in the terms of service of the website. If you go on a date, you've got to split

87
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,440
it. Just make sure that nobody locks you in their car and cuts all your skin off and then turns it

88
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,840
into a suit, a beautiful suit for them. Yeah, so make sure that doesn't happen.

89
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Make sure that that particular, because that'll happen, and you'll say,

90
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,800
oh, I wish I would have paid. I wish I would have listened to Griff and I'd still have my skin.

91
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
I look like Inside Out Boy. Protect the skin you're in.

92
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,080
Just don't use OkCupid. Use Match. OkCupid's a free service, and it's horrifying.

93
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,240
It attracts a certain element as a free service. A certain, I would say, unmoneyed element.

94
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,360
The last thing you want is an unmoneyed element in your dating pool. You want to keep it green.

95
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,720
Or in your car or just your immediate presence because they have two to four knives on them.

96
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,720
My friend keeps calling me her wife. I am in college with two roomies who I am good friends

97
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,400
with. What started out as an inside joke between us has spiraled right out of the comfort zone. My

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,320
one friend will refer to herself as my husband and call me wife or honey in public. She jokes about

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,960
us sleeping together to others' friends and gives awkward hugs around my waist. Is there any gentle

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:33,200
way to tell my friend she's creeping me out and that I want a divorce? That's from Miserable Misses.

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Oh my god. I need to like take a step back here and just pieces together.

102
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Is the emailer a guy? No, the email is a girl. Or a woman. She's of the female gender.

103
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:59,360
She's of the female gender. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, man, that's a toughie. It's not.

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,360
It's not? You just say, hey, just, you know, you're a great friend, but you're making me

105
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,200
feel uncomfortable with this because I don't feel that way about you. And oh man, this is a...

106
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,840
Yeah, right? Here's the tricky part about it. Because if she goes to her friend and is like,

107
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,120
hey, back off this, your friend will say, what? Can't you take it? I was just kidding.

108
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
It's a joke we've been playing. What's the matter? Jeez.

109
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,360
Is that this, her friend is definitely, definitely a secret lesbian. That's what you're saying.

110
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,400
Yeah. Sure. We know what you're saying. We've known you for like three decades.

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,080
It could also be like a, what's the single white female? Is that the roommate thing?

112
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,720
Really? No, it's the roommate. No, I'm sorry. It's swim fan.

113
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,760
Swim fan. No, I'm sorry. I know what you did last summer.

114
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
She might be swim fanning her last summer.

115
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,880
You're saying that she loves her friends so, so, so much that she will kill her in a public pool.

116
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,400
Yeah. It doesn't have to be like a lesbian thing. It could just be like,

117
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,480
she's obsessed with her friend a little bit. Come to my brother and me, ask us to fix your problems

118
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,920
and we will create much worse problems that you did not even know existed.

119
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,080
Listen, all I'm saying is your friend's going to kill you.

120
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,600
In a pool, a public pool. Count your blessings. It could be way worse.

121
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,680
Well, it couldn't be way worse. It could be in a public jacuzzi, which are gross.

122
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,840
This has nothing to do with, if your friend is making you feel uncomfortable,

123
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,800
sexuality doesn't have to enter into it. You just tell them, hey, I wish you wouldn't do this

124
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,040
in public. It makes me feel uncomfortable. You really don't have to approach a larger question.

125
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Just say, hey, you know, I wish you wouldn't do that.

126
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah.

127
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
It makes me uncomfortable. And then-

128
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,320
Especially start, start with the jokes about like you guys sleeping together and stuff like that,

129
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,560
and just say like, hey, that's one step too far. And then you can scale back from there

130
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,920
instead of trying to tackle the problem all at once. Right? So then start the conversation.

131
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
So you backpedal into it.

132
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Yeah.

133
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Interesting.

134
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Well, instead of just like bursting into a room, like cut out the joke, sister. I'm out.

135
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,400
I want to be your sister now. Pretend we're sisters.

136
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,360
We're sister wives.

137
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,200
And if that doesn't work, you realize that that's not what sister wives are about, right?

138
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,840
It's about two sisters that are married to each other.

139
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,640
That's not-

140
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:24,880
No.

141
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,520
I think that's it. It's about Tia and Tamara Mowry and they're married to each other. And

142
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,720
also that's my guys there.

143
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,840
No, but Tia and Tamara Mowry are married to the music.

144
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,680
It's sister, sister wives.

145
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,640
Let's, but what is Taj Mowry's relationship?

146
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,120
He's the guy that married them to each other against their will.

147
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,040
What are you talking about?

148
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Travis, that's, this is horrifying.

149
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
And then he sowed them to each other.

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,640
You're welcome, humans in a beat three. Good work, smart guy.

151
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah.

152
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,160
You could, poor smart guy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves because his show wasn't very

153
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,520
good. But, so I guess maybe he gets exactly. Griffin, help us out.

154
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,520
You want Yahoo? This one was sent in by Gali Ayali. Thanks, Gali. It's by Yahoo Answers user

155
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,680
David Barnhouse, who asks, how to convince family to become nudist? How can I convince

156
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
my family to become nudist and I am 14?

157
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,960
Oh God.

158
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:32,160
Now, you want to talk about awkward conversations.

159
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,160
Hey.

160
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
It starts with one sentence. Is it hot in here?

161
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:45,920
Yeah. Hey, I found a cool way for us to keep our air conditioning bill down. Get your dick out.

162
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,240
Get your dick out, dad and little bro.

163
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
Hey, little bro. Hey, teach. Why are you here, teach?

164
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,920
You heard. Teach heard it was going to get nasty over here. Get out of here, teach. Crazy dog.

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,840
Is there anything we can do for this person?

166
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,960
It's so sad, but 14 years old might be too late.

167
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
Maybe if you, oh, did you suggest cranking up the thermostat?

168
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah.

169
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Did you suggest that?

170
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,360
Yeah. I don't think this is, I don't think trickery is going to play into it.

171
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,840
So truth or dare?

172
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
No. Oh Christ.

173
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,040
Can you, can you burn all the clothes that's in the house?

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,600
They come home. You, they come home. There is a mountain of clothes in the backyard

175
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
and you are standing in front of it, naked and screaming. It looks like a scene out of

176
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Lord of the Flies and it's amazing. And they're so inspired by your example. And then you,

177
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,520
you go to them and say, I'm so cold. Please give me your clothes. I'm a child.

178
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,440
And then they give you their clothes and you say psych and you throw them in the fire too.

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
And you flick your lit cigarette onto the gasoline soaked clothes.

180
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,320
Now I just free, I just freed you. We just had a near life experience.

181
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
Call me Tyler Durden. Let's do this.

182
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
Call me Tyler Durden. I'm 14. I'm 14 year old Tyler Durden.

183
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
I can't do Fight Club. I'm too little.

184
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
I'm not allowed to watch Fight Club even.

185
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
Let's find it on TNT. Get that edited version.

186
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,840
How supportive is your family? Cause that's really the, that's what's,

187
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,240
if you go to your family and you say, listen, mom, dad,

188
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,520
little brother, little sis and grandpa, cause let's get nasty.

189
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:45,200
Um, I am, I am deathly afraid of clothes. I'm, I'm just super scared of clothes.

190
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,560
I don't like them. I don't like seeing them. I think that they're, you know,

191
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,400
when I wear them, it's just like trapping my soul inside my body.

192
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,360
When I want to just astral project it into the stars and become the most beautiful thing ever.

193
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,080
Can, can do you, can you go with me? Can you support me on this, on this vision quest?

194
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,640
Or just take all your clothes off and then your parents come home and you're like, check it.

195
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,320
This is me. Like who's coming with me. You can hop on, you can either get on the train or get hit

196
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
by the train, but either way I'm naked now. This is who I am. This is our reality.

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
This is who I am. I wish you, I wish you were it too.

198
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,880
Do you know who the first nudists were? Who's that Travis? Adam and Eve Griffin.

199
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
That's beautiful. Adam and Eve. There weren't no clothes in the garden

200
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,040
until that snake came along and ruined it all. That's true. All right. What if he,

201
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:45,600
if all that's returned to innocence, style fails, you take the morey mom and dad.

202
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,520
I want to be naked, live this dream with me. Also, are you my real mom? Let's take a DNA test

203
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,520
right now. Also, I can't stop. I can't stop being afraid of bats. Please help me, Maury.

204
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,240
This is tied to my nudity. I saw an episode of Maury recently where Maury likes to cure

205
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,840
people of their fears by something Maury believes in called immersion therapy,

206
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,280
where he, uh, it's like, I know you're afraid of band-aids. It's like, we're covering you in band-aids.

207
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,880
Wake up. You've been covered with band-aids this whole time. There was a lady who was afraid,

208
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,320
her big fear, tigers. And Maury brought a tiger. That's a perfectly reasonable fear.

209
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,520
Can we all keep our fear of tigers? Can we not, not be afraid of tigers? Like that seems like a super,

210
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,360
super good one. Deborah, just keep in mind that the tiger is just as afraid of you as you are.

211
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,840
Oh, no, no, it wasn't. Sorry, you're dead. They're acting like it's a problem because like,

212
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,720
I can't even look at Frosted Flakes. Don't get Frosted Flakes. Don't go to Frosted Flakes.

213
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,640
Don't get Frosted Flakes. Don't go to Frosted Flakes. Don't eat Frosted Flakes. Get the off-bland, like,

214
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,600
you know, toasted flakes. And don't go to Exxon. And like, I think that's pretty much it, right?

215
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Don't go to any Bengals games. My day-to-day exposure to tigers is actually pretty low.

216
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,560
Now, I don't have to see a tiger if I don't want to. You know what? Thinking about that,

217
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,920
mine might be a little bit too low. I'm not sure I'm getting enough vitamin T. I need to see more

218
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,880
tigers every day. You should just start wearing, like, tiger print pants. You know what? That would

219
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:28,480
be good. And then go visit this woman. Grr. Look at my pants. Ah! Ah! Girl, I'm not myers.

220
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,680
I think you just gotta, you just gotta get naked. And then, if your family really loves you,

221
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:45,280
they'll get naked too. Without saying a word. Without no discussion. And no looking. No one

222
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,440
can look at anyone else. Please don't. The weirdest Thanksgiving dinner ever.

223
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,960
Hey, Dylan. Here's your advice from your old buddies, my brother, my brother, and me. How

224
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,360
about you just keep your clothes on? You're 14 years old. You don't get to do anything you want

225
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,280
to. Why is this the one? We're not gonna let you drive, but we'll let you start an incest cult in

226
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,880
your family and upset the delicate balance your parents have worked so hard to create. I'm sorry,

227
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,280
you're 14. You don't get to do anything, and this is no exception. It makes me so bad. These kids,

228
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,720
these kids today. Kids and their nudism. With their inya and their pictures of tigers.

229
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,680
Is this an epidemic that I don't, are kids really like, did this happen on Glee? And now kids are

230
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,000
like, I wanna- They already had, they already had, they had so many gay kids, they had to have a kid

231
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,560
who like, pushed it even further. Pushed the envelope. And that's the nudist kid. It's like,

232
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,640
Sue Sylvester, accept me for who I am. Please let me join the Cheerios. I don't have any clothes

233
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,480
on ever. I'm a nightmare for the censors. It's hard to get me in scenes. And then at the end,

234
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,880
everybody's like, we're so sorry we judged you. And they sing a hip hop version of The Streak.

235
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,160
Oh God, Ray Stevens deep cuts.

236
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,040
And Ray Stevens, it was like there, but like, it's not him. It turns out it's just the kid

237
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,520
in the wheelchair with a fake beard. He's like, Ethel, don't look Ethel! And then they sing it

238
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,280
with the, it's mashed up though. It's mashed up with Madonna's new track. So it's-

239
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
And that episode won an Emmy.

240
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,960
It's an Emmy winning episode. Also starring Uma Thurman is on that one.

241
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,880
Let's move on.

242
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,480
Do we have to?

243
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
We need to.

244
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
Story, by the way, TM, story by credit, Justin, Travis, by the way.

245
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,160
Pilot script, we're pitching it. Universal, NBC Universal, please reach out to us. Fox,

246
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Fox Universal Entertainment, please reach out to us.

247
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Come at me. Come at me with your briefcase. Full of money.

248
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Hey, I always carry cash. My boyfriend never does. If a place is cash only, I pay, which is fine.

249
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,880
Cashier's always hand him the change and he doesn't give it back to me. When I ask for my

250
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,000
change, he books fund me for being cheap. Probably because he comes from a wealthy family and makes

251
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,560
more money than I do. Sometimes he'll pay for something with my change and act like he's

252
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,840
treating me. Also cash lent, never returned. How do I gently convince my boyfriend that money matters?

253
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
That's from broken, broken hearted.

254
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,080
Okay, first off, why are you letting your boyfriend hand money to cashier?

255
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,680
All the women, independent, throw your cash right at him. You can pay for yourself. It's 2012.

256
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,600
No, no, no, no, no. You're, you're misunderstanding. She gives the cashier,

257
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,360
these cashiers are some pricks because she'll give them money. And then the cashiers,

258
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
when they come back to the table or something, they give it to the guy.

259
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,400
Oh, what?

260
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,880
Just as if to say, sorry, sir, you accidentally let your woman have some money.

261
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,400
I can't tell you how many times this happens on a day to day basis. When I go to a restaurant

262
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,320
and my girlfriend orders a stiff IPA and I order, you know, like a-

263
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
Shirley Temple.

264
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,920
Something.

265
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,000
Like some sort of mild Pinot Gris.

266
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,680
Yeah. And then they flip them and I say, I don't like, I don't like what you've done here, sir.

267
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
I detract 2% from the tip right there. I have a whole conversion rate for,

268
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,080
for social and sexual faux pas and, and how I detract from tips.

269
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,800
This is some horse shit and you shouldn't go to that restaurant anymore.

270
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,520
How much, how much do you detract for taking the dish of butter and jamming it into a customer's

271
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,760
face?

272
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,200
I get bonus for that. Cause that's my fetish.

273
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
That's how you do it. Okay.

274
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah. I'm a butter side upper is what we, that's what we're called on the forums.

275
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,280
Butter side uppers. How much do you, is it better or worse when after they jam it in your face,

276
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
they say sloppy boy.

277
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,120
Way better.

278
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,000
Is that way better? Is that the only way Griffin can finish?

279
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
Oh, I wish you wouldn't say that.

280
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,960
Oh, but I did.

281
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,680
Say that all you want. Just don't talk about like-

282
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,240
But if I say it too much, you may have to excuse yourself.

283
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Yeah. Pardon?

284
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,400
Cause apparently butter is your thing.

285
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
How many places in this world are cash only these days?

286
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,160
I mean, it's getting less, but they're still there, right?

287
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,640
And everything.

288
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
Well, I guess the easy answer then is stop carrying cash.

289
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
I bought some, uh, some Girl Scout cookies outside of the Walgreens and I realized they

290
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,280
didn't have any cash on me. And their, uh, their troop leader had one of those square

291
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,360
things like an iPhone credit card reader. And I was like, God damn it, 2012. I love you so much.

292
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
You got me.

293
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,920
You got me. Now I can buy so many more cookies.

294
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,560
Yeah. That's a little, that's a little bit much actually.

295
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm not sure that you need that kind of like direct access. Is there, is there a

296
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,120
correlation between that and the fact that you're counting your K cows now? Is there-

297
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,080
Things got a little hedonistic.

298
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,000
Let's just say February was a rough, rough month for the diabetes that I almost got.

299
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,440
Come to hedonism and cookies three. There are no rules.

300
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,760
Can we get back to the issue at hand, which is that your boyfriend sounds kind of like an asshole.

301
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,880
Hey, the thing may not be the, the money. It may just be that he's an asshole.

302
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,640
It's just a, that's a, that's a shitty thing. Okay. First off, it sucks that a cashier would

303
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,280
come back and give your money to him just because he thinks that the guy paid, right?

304
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
You obviously handed this cashier the money. How fucking short is his

305
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
He's like a fucking goldfish memory.

306
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,160
So that sucks. What double sucks is that he takes the money instead of saying,

307
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,960
Oh, this is awkward. This is yours. That sucks.

308
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,400
What also sucks is him using your money to buy you things and say, don't worry about it.

309
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
You're welcome. I love you. That's for you.

310
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,880
There are a bunch of things there for people who like,

311
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,680
for those of us who've gone around our lives, judging people all the time.

312
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,280
Um, this judgment is, is it, man, it seems pretty clear cut.

313
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,200
I am the sense that bothers me is when you ask for your change back, like, like, Hey,

314
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
that changed his mind. He calls you cheap because he's rich.

315
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,240
Like that sounds like that's what the, that's what like the

316
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,200
bad boyfriend does before like a robber Baron does.

317
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,800
Can I please have my money? Oh, you poor person and your change.

318
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:56,160
Oh, it's adorable. Maybe you can eventually just going to start throwing it at her feet.

319
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,680
Fine. Pick it up. Pick it up.

320
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,760
If you don't want to leave this creep, you gotta tell him like, Hey, yeah,

321
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,000
you come from a wealthy family, but I earned this money with the fucking sweat off my back.

322
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
So stop robbing me. If you could do me a favor and stop fucking burglaring me.

323
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,360
Every time we go to Applebee's, that would be fucking great.

324
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,680
And stop making fun of me for going to Applebee's. It's all I can afford. Asshole.

325
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,840
Jerk. Yeah. If you say that to him once, he's going to feel very bad about it.

326
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,120
If he does not feel very bad about it, the door is right behind you, sister.

327
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,040
It's time to pick up stakes and roll on out of there. Cause I'll tell you what,

328
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,800
he sounds whack. He doesn't, he doesn't sound good enough for you. That's for sure.

329
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,080
Oh, I'm going to Sherlock this shit. You ready? You ready for the Cumberbatch?

330
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Yeah. Your boyfriend never, your boyfriend never carries cash. Huh?

331
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,800
But he says he's from a wealthy family. I ain't buying it.

332
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,200
I think, oh shit, your boyfriend is broke like a bad joke.

333
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,320
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

334
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,000
He is tower heisting you every single time you go to dinner.

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You're being grifted. You're dating Alan Alda?

336
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,880
You aren't. Oh good. Oh good.

337
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
Hold on. A tower heist joke for everyone to enjoy.

338
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
Travis, you know about the transitive property, right?

339
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
If you make a joke about something that's not even remotely funny,

340
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,160
then it's not funny in exchange.

341
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,040
But you brought up tower heist and you opened the door like

342
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,640
a poor man in the movie Tower Heist named Lester.

343
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,720
You are getting taken to the bank and he is driving the car and you are, hold on.

344
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,800
You're an ATM and he's putting a card in your slot.

345
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,000
He's putting a card in there and he, but he's saying it's your card

346
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,320
and he's taking your money and then he's spending it on rollerblades or something.

347
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,160
It sounds like a boyfriend Ponzi scheme.

348
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,160
I don't know what a Ponzi scheme is. Is your boyfriend's name Ponzi?

349
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,160
He's a cool guy, but same Ponzi.

350
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,520
Everything about this just reeks to high heaven of grifting.

351
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,800
Yeah, it feels like a long con. It feels like a grift.

352
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,280
You need to protect yourself, protect your assets.

353
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,000
Speaking of protecting your assets,

354
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,040
we would like to protect ours right now.

355
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Make a little money in the section of the show we like to call the money zone.

356
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,920
Oh, hey, Trav.

357
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,680
Hey, what's the matter, Justin?

358
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,280
It's not a big deal. I don't think you'd understand.

359
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,960
Oh, no, come on. Let's wrap.

360
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
Well, I've been going store to store.

361
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,080
Uh-huh.

362
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,800
I've been looking at all my normal, my normal places that I normally head to.

363
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:11,600
And I, for the life of me, cannot find a leather sleep sack that properly restrains me for my erotic play.

364
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,440
Well, you're in luck, Justin.

365
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,120
So, what do you, wait, what do you mean?

366
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,480
Well, this week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

367
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
there is a synergy of energies coming together.

368
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,940
Okay.

369
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,560
The peanut butter and jelly of podcast and sponsor this week.

370
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,560
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me and ExtremeRestraints.com.

371
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,320
The crossover you knew had to happen is finally here.

372
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,520
What do you want?

373
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,520
Do you want Japanese silk bondage rope, 10 feet of it?

374
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, we can get you that. It's just $11.

375
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,280
You want a door jam bondage accessory?

376
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,160
Maybe spicing's up in the boudoir.

377
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:01,520
I think it's good to know that some of the things on Extreme Restraints may seem unusual to you at first,

378
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,800
the first time you head there.

379
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,880
But it's none of it is going to unnerve you as much as the way I say boudoir.

380
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,800
So, I reset, I'm recalibrating.

381
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,520
Now that you've heard me say boudoir,

382
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,520
you can go to this website and just look around.

383
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,560
Poke around. You don't know.

384
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,240
And you know what's awesome?

385
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,920
Right there on the first page, there's a little select area

386
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,240
where you can pick what area of your body you would like to pleasure.

387
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,880
Oh, really?

388
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,560
So you just figure out where the sensitivity is there for you.

389
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,480
Want nipple toys?

390
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
You want nipple clamps that aren't toys?

391
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
Those are for grownups.

392
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
These are all for grownups.

393
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm sorry.

394
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,280
Do they have anything for my weenus?

395
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,120
Oh, your weener, huh?

396
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,320
No, no, no, no, no.

397
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,720
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,720
You misunderstood my weenus.

400
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
The skin on your elbow?

401
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
Sure, we can get you an arm binder.

402
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Right on the crook of your elbow.

403
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,920
We can get you a strict leather bicep binder.

404
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,840
Those are a steal at just $45.

405
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
Or leather restraints, like whatever you need.

406
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,800
They've got you taken care of.

407
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,440
And now, as far as your weener, they actually do not have anything

408
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,320
that interacts with the genitals at all.

409
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
That's the only problem.

410
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,160
Hold on.

411
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,560
Stop.

412
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,360
That seems like a huge market that they are not tapping into.

413
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,840
I know.

414
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
It's weird, right?

415
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
They're supposed to be adult toys, but no, wait a minute.

416
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
I was on the wrong page.

417
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
They have literally everything you could ever imagine.

418
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Masturbation toys, other things, like everything.

419
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,360
I don't even know.

420
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,960
You need to get here and just get.

421
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,640
It's 2012.

422
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,440
You can get all this stuff on the internet and just check it out.

423
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
I don't know.

424
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,400
It goes like the full spectrum.

425
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,360
Everything you could think.

426
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
It is the full spectrum.

427
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
If you want something tame, if you want handcuffs, that's cool.

428
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,360
If you want something less tame, if you want a cage that you can put your penis in

429
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,920
because it did something illegal and now has to go to genital jail, that's cool too.

430
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Anything is cool.

431
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,880
It's all, this is extremistrains.com, catchphrase, it's all cool.

432
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
Is that their catchphrase?

433
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,640
Now, that does not apply to their burning mat that you put on your chest to burn your

434
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
chest skin off.

435
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,400
No, that's not cool.

436
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,040
That's not cool.

437
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,600
That's not cool.

438
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,400
That's very, very hot.

439
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
That is actually not a real thing.

440
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,160
But yeah, I mean, they've got all the regular stuff, the vanilla stuff.

441
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,440
You know, you want some shackles, you want blindfolds.

442
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
They've got all that stuff.

443
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,400
Oh, and say my favorite phrase that I found as I was browsing their site.

444
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:48,480
And let's say, let's say you want some lube, but there's not enough at the store.

445
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
You can get some lube in bulk.

446
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,920
Gallons and gallons of lube.

447
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,720
Bulk lube.

448
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,680
The snippy lady at Kroger isn't going to raise her eyebrow at you for buying this lube.

449
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
You're getting this at home.

450
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,160
So get something, you know, get something a little more regular, something a little

451
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,880
more vanilla, and then maybe throw something a little crazy in there.

452
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,200
See what the hubbub is about.

453
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,080
You've earned it.

454
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
And here's the exciting part.

459
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,200
You are going to need to build a new room onto your house to hold all the dildos that

460
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,560
you are going to buy.

461
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,720
Dildos, magic wands, throat gags.

462
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,200
Hold on.

463
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,160
Magic wands?

464
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,320
Not that kind of magic wands.

465
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Wingardium Leviosa.

466
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,040
Oh, yeah.

467
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,200
Now my penis is flying away from me.

468
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,520
No, come back.

469
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,360
Guys, if you use the coupon code MIDDLEST to buy a vibrating cock ring, please don't

470
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,880
tell us about it, but know that I feel it and I sense it.

471
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
Somewhere in the universe.

472
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,520
And it has made me so happy.

473
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,240
This is probably the best thing we've ever done with this entire program.

474
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,760
Go to ExtruderShanks.com and visit our buddy James and all the cool people over there and

475
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
get yourself something fun.

476
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm sure it comes in discrete, discrete packaging.

477
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,640
It's not going to you're not going to have a box sitting on your doorstep that says

478
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,880
bulk anal lube inside open with care.

479
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,000
Unless you want that.

480
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,160
You can probably make a special request like draw a dinosaur on box with a speech bubble

481
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,200
saying bulk anal lube.

482
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,400
That is the only way.

483
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,080
That is my particular fetish.

484
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,000
So go for it.

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
ExtruderShanks.com, spelled just the way it sounds.

486
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,080
ExtruderShanks.com.

487
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,320
I'm going to now to write a song about this.

488
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,600
Griffin's being modest, of course.

489
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
He wrote an entire album about this.

490
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,620
Here we go.

491
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,080
Put your dick in this cage.

492
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm just going to do a remix of Staxxope.

493
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't steal Staxxope's song.

494
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,280
God damn it.

495
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Everybody's got some needs and everybody's got some wants.

496
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
Extreme Restraints catalog of sexual products will fulfill both of those things for you.

497
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:28,000
So visit ExtremeRestraints.com and get an electroshock paddle that goes on your balls.

498
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,040
Is that a real thing?

499
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,200
It should be.

500
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,360
I'm going to request that you put a real product in there.

501
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:46,320
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com and buy a ghost that you can fuck every night.

502
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
That's not a thing.

503
00:35:50,400 --> 00:36:00,160
We need a site called ExtremeRestraints.com and buy a sexual fish tank.

504
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,840
You're doing an ad for ExtremeRestraints.com.

505
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com and learn about all the good chicken pot pie recipes.

506
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
On the forums.

507
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,840
Holy inaccurate.

508
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,280
Everything you're saying right now is a bastardization of this product message.

509
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:32,880
But go to ExtremeRestraints.com and you will find everything that you want and some things you didn't

510
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,160
know you want and some things you might be surprised to find out that you do indeed want.

511
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
How about a Yahoo?

512
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,380
Yeah.

513
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,360
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Mark Toretsky.

514
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,920
Thank you, Mark.

515
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley Grace who asks,

516
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,360
My mom has changed my name four times legally since I've been born.

517
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,960
Hello, I'm Haley Grace and I am 15 years old and my mom has legally changed my name

518
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
four times since I've been born.

519
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,960
When I was born, I was called Victoria Rose.

520
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,480
Then when I was six months old, she legally changed it to Dracey Mae.

521
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Then when I was six, she changed it again to Rhiannon.

522
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,880
And then she changed it again when I was 11 years old to Haley Grace.

523
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
I have moved school five times and have moved house four times.

524
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,040
My mom says don't ever say your name out in public.

525
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,800
We never open our curtains in the house and I never have friends over to stay.

526
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,120
I don't have any other family than my mom.

527
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,640
Why does she keep changing my name?

528
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
Is there a reason?

529
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,680
Wait, this took a sharp left turn.

530
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

531
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,320
Yeah.

532
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,680
Wait a- hold on just a one-

533
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,200
So this isn't like crazy mom can't settle on a name.

534
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
This is like they informed on the mafia.

535
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,720
Or like-

536
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,920
Or possibly that your mom fucking snatched you from a hospital when you were a baby and

537
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,400
now has to-

538
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,320
See, I was also gonna go towards they blew up like an animal testing research center in

539
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
the 60s and she's on the run.

540
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,440
No, no, I'm saying it's definite, definite baby kidnapping, keeping her head on a swivel.

541
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,080
Could it be both?

542
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,120
Just a really risky mom who both blew up an animal testing facility and stole a baby?

543
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,920
It sounds like a really cool mom.

544
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,360
Hey, cool mom you got there.

545
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,440
Maybe they got her at the baby testing facility.

546
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,560
Maybe they were doing-

547
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,760
They blew up a baby testing facility, but they saved one baby.

548
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,240
Well, you Travis, you saved the babies.

549
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Have you ever never watched TV?

550
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
You get the animals out, then you blow up the building.

551
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,840
Don't call babies animals.

552
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm saying in a normal thing, not like-

553
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
Babies are animals though, if you think about it.

554
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,080
At least often do tricks.

555
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Babies just remind you of your failed promise.

556
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,840
That's not a trick.

557
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,640
Can a person-

558
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,080
Can a mom change their kid's name?

559
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,360
At will?

560
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,880
No, legally.

561
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,280
They have to-

562
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,880
I mean, I imagine there's some paperwork.

563
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,600
I imagine court costs have to come into it too.

564
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,080
But you know what?

565
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
I bet in this day and age you can do it online.

566
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,280
You think?

567
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
A few clicks?

568
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,520
Oh, I'm sure you can.

569
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,240
Amazon?

570
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,880
I tried to-

571
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,680
Actually, I tried to change my AOL instant messenger name.

572
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,800
I accidentally changed my real name to Blunt Lover.

573
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,120
Blunt Lover 87.

574
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
So that's my legal name now.

575
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,160
If you're seen on Facebook when someone puts a really funny middle name in, that's legal.

576
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,080
I wouldn't say funny.

577
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
How shitty would it be to have a new name?

578
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,520
Every time-

579
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
Like, oh, I'm in middle school now.

580
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,320
Time to celebrate.

581
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
Now I'm called Beyonce.

582
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Fantastic.

583
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,400
Thanks, Mom.

584
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,400
I would love to be able to reinvent myself like that all the time.

585
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,080
You'd be like Prince, you know?

586
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,440
People would never know where you're going.

587
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,680
You know what would be great?

588
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Instead of changing your name, you just add a name to your name.

589
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,680
So like every time you move, you just add another one to the beginning.

590
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,040
So I'm Victoria Rose, Dracey May, Rihanna, and Hailey Grace.

591
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,240
Hi.

592
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Oh, you left.

593
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,720
Okay.

594
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Could you be the kid formerly known as Hailey?

595
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,760
Just go with that.

596
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,720
An unpronounceable symbol that your mom can't pronounce on you.

597
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,040
Now you're just an umlaut over no letter.

598
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,880
That's your name now.

599
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
Why is this mom changing the name?

600
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Why won't this mom let her say her daughter's name out in public?

601
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,880
Because if she says her name out in public, the goblins can take her, Griffin.

602
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,680
That's what it is.

603
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
This is a Rumpelstiltskin situation.

604
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,440
She promised her firstborn to some sort of diminutive but vengeful spirit.

605
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
And now if the child's name is ever said aloud

606
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
or not changed to a different Hannah Montana character every few years,

607
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,480
then he'll come and find her and take her away on his big spoon.

608
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,800
And you know, I see that happening more and more.

609
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,120
Giant spoon?

610
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,000
It's a giant spoon.

611
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
He rides around on a ladle.

612
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,080
Yeah.

613
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,360
Rumpelstiltskin.

614
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,680
Hold on, I gotta write this.

615
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,240
I need to get a big spoon from Extreme Restraints.

616
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Sorry, go on.

617
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,320
Can I tell you something, Griffin?

618
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,440
Don't go with the fiberglass.

619
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
You think the splinters aren't gonna be a problem?

620
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,320
They definitely, definitely are.

621
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,040
Definitely are.

622
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,080
Gots to go with steel.

623
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,360
Gotta go with steel.

624
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,880
Well, careful with that, it gets cold.

625
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,560
If it doesn't get cold, what's the point?

626
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,440
Fair enough.

627
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,800
So you have been kidnapped.

628
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,680
Let's talk about-

629
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
So you've been kidnapped.

630
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,720
So you've been kidnapped.

631
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,600
Let's talk about action plans here for a kidnapped person.

632
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,840
One, do you like your new mom?

633
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,200
Do you like new mommy?

634
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,040
She may be nicer than old mommy.

635
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
You don't know that.

636
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,120
She actually kind of sounds like Anjelica Huston in every movie

637
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,600
where Anjelica Huston plays an irresponsible mom.

638
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,920
A wildly irresponsible mom.

639
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,880
How many movies is that?

640
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,240
How many movies is that?

641
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,080
Did you confuse her with somebody?

642
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,800
No, no, no.

643
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Several, several movies.

644
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,200
Name one, and do not count Adam's Family Values.

645
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,880
It is, I do not count it.

646
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,440
How about fucking Darjeeling Limited?

647
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,400
And how about, what was that one movie where...

648
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,800
Oh God.

649
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
There's another movie where she was a mom

650
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,560
and she was horrible to her child.

651
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,920
Hunger Games.

652
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,080
I don't think that was it.

653
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,120
I'm not sure that's what you're thinking of.

654
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,840
X-Men 3.

655
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
Fuck, what was that movie?

656
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,400
God damn it.

657
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,560
Is your mom Anjelica Huston?

658
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,400
Oh, that might make sense.

659
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,920
She might just be eccentric.

660
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,560
Yeah, you know how those movie stars are.

661
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,840
I don't know movie stars.

662
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,600
One day your kid's name Apple the app,

663
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,760
the next day he's name Henny Youngman.

664
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,720
It's famous people for you.

665
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,040
Choke!

666
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,680
If anybody out there-

667
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,480
It was choke.

668
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,760
Everybody, it was choke.

669
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,960
It was choke.

670
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,440
You're right.

671
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,320
I was, whoa, whoa, whoa.

672
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,640
We did not plan this.

673
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,480
This is a question from a listener.

674
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,120
Oh my God.

675
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Hi, I was thinking I would legally change

676
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
my full name after college.

677
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I've all decided my new first name to be Bishop,

678
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,200
but I can't think of a last or middle name

679
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
that sounds good with it.

680
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,320
Do you think I should go through with this?

681
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,840
If so, what should my new name be?

682
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,880
That's fucking mysterious in Michigan.

683
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,040
Are we serious with this?

684
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,160
Is this?

685
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,120
This is Haley Grace's boyfriend.

686
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,620
Mm-hmm.

687
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,000
My girlfriend keeps changing her name.

688
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,200
I think it's a great idea.

689
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Yeah, I want to change mine to be an X-Man.

690
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,140
Bishop.

691
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,780
Bishop.

692
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,120
Can I call you Bishop?

693
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,000
Can I call-

694
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
Should we goof on names to call him

695
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,120
before I tell him not to do it?

696
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,280
Yeah, yeah, let's get a solid,

697
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,120
I'll say two and a half minutes of goofing on the name

698
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,440
and then we'll get to the meat.

699
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,880
You can stick with a chess theme

700
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,720
and go like Bishop Rookpawn.

701
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,220
Yeah.

702
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,520
That's a bad name.

703
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,680
Could you say Archdiocese as a name?

704
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,040
Cardinal.

705
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,720
Ooh, Cardinal's actually not bad.

706
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,000
Bishop Cardinal?

707
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,880
No, no, no.

708
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,840
That's not so good.

709
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,560
Major Major?

710
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,600
Bishop Laser Killer.

711
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,120
No, why would he kill lasers?

712
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,920
No, he uses lasers to kill people.

713
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,880
Bishop Dino Pal.

714
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,440
He's friend of the dinosaurs.

715
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
Bishop Exploder.

716
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,440
Stop it.

717
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,880
What's wrong with that?

718
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,320
Bishop the Thundarian is that good.

719
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,720
Bishop of Mars.

720
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,760
I can't go any further.

721
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,960
Don't fucking do this.

722
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,240
Don't do this thing.

723
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,680
I don't care what your old name is.

724
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,400
It's your name.

725
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,040
If you, you have been saving up,

726
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,120
we're big on social currency on this show

727
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,480
and when you change your name

728
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,360
to to Bishop Rocketship

729
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,080
or something even more ironic than that,

730
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,800
you're gonna lose it all.

731
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,560
You're gonna bankrupt yourself

732
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,400
of all that currency

733
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,680
and you're starting from scratch

734
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,360
and let me tell you, you are,

735
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't know how old you are.

736
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,800
You're about to graduate college.

737
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,440
You are too old to start from scratch again.

738
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,720
I also feel that changing,

739
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,400
it's a lot like quantum physics.

740
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,960
Hear me out.

741
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,760
In, in observing the experiment,

742
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,040
you're gonna change the outcome.

743
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
So in consciously choosing your name,

744
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,680
it's gonna be douchey no matter what.

745
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,840
I like, if I don't think no matter what you choose,

746
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
like because you chose it,

747
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,320
it because it's a conscious effort,

748
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,360
it's not gonna work.

749
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,240
When I hear somebody say the name Griffin out loud,

750
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,080
I think that it's kind of a douchey name,

751
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,480
but I didn't give it to myself.

752
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
So I haven't, I haven't actually

753
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,840
I haven't out there.

754
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,080
I can just say my parents gave it to me.

755
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,880
So it's legit.

756
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,320
But when I hear other people call themselves Griffin,

757
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,280
I can't help but think

758
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,520
that they are just calling themselves that as a nickname

759
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,840
because it sounded cool that one time

760
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,160
that they heard it on a comedy podcast

761
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,920
or maybe back to the future part two.

762
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,360
Mm-hmm.

763
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,000
Exactly.

764
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,680
Thank you for summing up exactly

765
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,040
what I was getting at Griffin.

766
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,280
Yeah.

767
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,720
Concision.

768
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,560
It's the name of the game.

769
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,400
Bishop Concision.

770
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,200
Bishop Concision.

771
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
That's the name of the person.

772
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
Don't, don't change your,

773
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,920
don't change your fucking name

774
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,760
because there's no name you can give yourself.

775
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,760
This is like how you can't give yourself a nickname,

776
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,880
but to a legal, like to the billionth degree,

777
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,960
you can't, you cannot do this.

778
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
Maybe instead of changing your name,

779
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
you should change your outlook on life.

780
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,480
Oh, wow.

781
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,840
Whoa.

782
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,760
We just opened up the secret in here.

783
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,520
I look at this a lot the same way

784
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,960
of people saying like, I want to like,

785
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,600
get a radical hairstyle change

786
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,920
or I want to get like a giant tattoo on my face.

787
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,360
Like all that stuff is fine.

788
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,840
But before you do it, really sit down

789
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,560
and think about what's the real reason I want to do this.

790
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,400
And I'd be willing to bet

791
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,160
it's not because you don't like your name.

792
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,360
What if, can we, hold on.

793
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,160
Devil's advocate.

794
00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:02,880
What if his name right now is like Coney Diarrhea?

795
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
We didn't consider the fact that his name right now

796
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,080
might be Coney Diarrhea.

797
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,240
So his name is Rock Jabroni.

798
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,240
What if it's a real, real shitshow in there in that name?

799
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,920
What if his name is Dennis Shitshow?

800
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,240
I'm Dennis Shitshow, attorney of law.

801
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,200
I'm Dennis Shitshow, third grade teacher.

802
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,120
I'm Dennis Shitshow, plumber, get it?

803
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,760
Late night comedy host.

804
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,200
I'm Dennis Shitshow, your father,

805
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,640
and you will obey me as long as you live under my roof.

806
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,520
You are a shitshow, Daniel, and you will act like it.

807
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,040
I think you just gotta,

808
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,440
I think you just gotta let it ride.

809
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,520
You gotta dance with the one who brung you, you know?

810
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,160
And by the one, I mean your fucking legal

811
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,440
God-given Christian name.

812
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,080
Unless four different names brung you

813
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,600
because your mom's a kook.

814
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,160
Yeah, yep.

815
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,280
And then in that case, I guess go hog wild.

816
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,840
She raised you to change her name, so that's you.

817
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,960
That's your identity.

818
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,760
But I wouldn't, I don't think it's a good,

819
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,040
I mean, I think Griffin's right that like the name is not,

820
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,520
I mean, I think maybe this is like body modification

821
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,560
or something, you know?

822
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,440
You want to take ownership, but like, I don't know.

823
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,920
It just seems like cheating, I guess, in a way.

824
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,840
Like, I think we all wish we had names

825
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,640
that were really, really cool.

826
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,280
But, you know, most of us don't

827
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,440
because we're not secret agents or whatever.

828
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,960
Got kind of bummery in here.

829
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,640
Yeah, how about a Yahoo answer?

830
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,960
Yeah, let's clear out, let's open up the windows

831
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,320
and try to sweep some of this bummer out.

832
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,520
Don't change your name, though.

833
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,960
Like, be proud of your name.

834
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,040
Change your situation.

835
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,680
Make people envious of Craig's Shitshow.

836
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,520
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

837
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,080
Thank you, Lisa.

838
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nathan, who asks,

839
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,720
can I pack a toilet plunger in my airplane luggage?

840
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,640
The question is as simple as it says above.

841
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,080
I'm going, oh no, it is not.

842
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,680
I am going on a trip next week

843
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,600
and I am flying to my destination.

844
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,480
Usually how it works.

845
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,600
I like taking a toilet plunger when I drive

846
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,360
so I don't have to call the hotel desk

847
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,960
if a quote unquote bathroom issue arises.

848
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,440
I know it sounds silly, but I truly want to know

849
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,480
if I can pack a toilet, I think they mean a plunger.

850
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,680
If I can pack a toilet in my luggage.

851
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,160
This toilet's broken, I'm putting in my own toilet.

852
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,680
Or if I can carry it on board the plane in a bag, of course.

853
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,040
I really appreciate this.

854
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,320
The problem with packing a toilet is that the caulk

855
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,400
that you'll need to seal it is probably going to be

856
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,520
over three ounces.

857
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,120
So they're going to make you throw that away.

858
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,840
And it's so hard to find travel size caulk.

859
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,800
You know what?

860
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,440
We, we, we like to have a good time here.

861
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,880
Oh, my brother, my brother, hear me

862
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,120
and poke fun at the occupants, guys.

863
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,320
I like this gentleman.

864
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,600
You like him?

865
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,200
You think he's like industrious?

866
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,840
I think, I think he's revolutionary, Justin.

867
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,880
Go on.

868
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,800
Have you never been in that situation?

869
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,920
You've been at a friend's house.

870
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,840
You've been at a hotel and you've clogged it.

871
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,280
And you've had just like that horrifying moment of like,

872
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,880
well, I have two options.

873
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,040
I can either run away and never look back

874
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,840
or I have to call, you know, the front desk.

875
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,040
Or tell my friend like, hey, I'm really bad at bathroom

876
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,760
and I broke it.

877
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,360
It's a weird sort of like.

878
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,560
You realize, you realize that clogging a toilet

879
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,240
is not indicative of a deficit of bathroom skill, right?

880
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,600
It seems pretty bad to me.

881
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,040
Like you've been training for what, for me, 26 years.

882
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,560
And like when I clog a toilet, it's like, hey, you failed.

883
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,920
Griffin, if there aren't, if there aren't, you know,

884
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,600
deficit in the bathroom skill, it's not a skill.

885
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,640
Why do we have training pots?

886
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,360
Exactly. You got to learn how to hold them.

887
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,160
Know when to fold them, you know, I mean, your toilet paper.

888
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,160
This is guy, I'm kind of, I'm kind of with you, Trev.

889
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,000
Now, after thinking about this guy, because it's like,

890
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,800
it seems like a crazy thing and maybe it is.

891
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,040
But flip side, if it pays off, if he avoids a situation,

892
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,080
he is suddenly the smartest guy in the room.

893
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,960
That's what I'm saying.

894
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,040
He, I mean, it's a real high bet, but it, but again,

895
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,160
when it pays out, when that, when the, you know,

896
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,560
comes up all cherries, it will make it seem like,

897
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,720
well, why wouldn't you have a plunger with you?

898
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,360
Of course you would.

899
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,960
I can just write in my head, like the epic situation of like,

900
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,520
as he goes through like the baggage claim and stuff

901
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,960
and they're checking his carry on, they're like,

902
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,160
oh, is this a plunger, bro?

903
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,840
There's nothing illegal about it, but weird.

904
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,280
What a weirdo, right?

905
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,200
But then, then something occurs on the plane

906
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,000
or the plane has to make an emergency landing on an island.

907
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,800
Stop it, stop it.

908
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,600
And they're like, if only someone had a plunger.

909
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,200
There's no toilets on an island, Travis, you just.

910
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,040
If only someone, no, they need the plunger to like,

911
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,320
climb up a mountain or something.

912
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,520
Why would that, what the fuck are you talking about?

913
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
They use it like suction cups and they suction cup

914
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,120
to the side of the tree or something.

915
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,080
This isn't, this isn't an episode of Duck Man.

916
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,920
And it stars, and it stars Morgan, Morgan Freeman's there.

917
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,840
And he's like, oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

918
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,360
Morgan Freeman's there, and he's like.

919
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,720
Why is Morgan Freeman there?

920
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,240
There's no toilets on the island.

921
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,360
He had the plunger, Griffin.

922
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,040
He's a pilot, Travis.

923
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,320
His friend, John Travolta, would probably fly him

924
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,600
anywhere he wants to go for free.

925
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,080
Maybe John Travolta's writing this question,

926
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,440
and John Travolta wants to carry a plunger in his bag.

927
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,600
You stupid asshole.

928
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,160
No, you're not thinking three-dimensionally, Griffin.

929
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,960
You're thinking very small.

930
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,920
You're thinking inside the box.

931
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,200
I'm thinking outside the box.

932
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,240
There's no box.

933
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,280
There's no toilets on islands.

934
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,320
I'm operating on all these cylinders,

935
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,200
and you're talking about like a tiny, tiny life.

936
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,680
You're saying there are so many practical applications

937
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,680
for a plunger that I can't even begin to understand.

938
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,280
I'm just saying there's more than you think there are.

939
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,600
Like, you have a very small plunger concept, and I think.

940
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,880
You're saying you crash an island, you stand in the waves,

941
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,960
and let your feet sink into the sand,

942
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,920
and then you use the plunger.

943
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,280
You raise the plunger above your head.

944
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,400
You spear a fish, and then you suck into it.

945
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,360
Okay, guys, stop.

946
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,640
I'm putting a stop to this.

947
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
There's only one way to settle this.

948
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:53,840
Okay.

949
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,040
And that is with a plunger usefulness face-off.

950
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,080
Here are the rules.

951
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,280
Okay.

952
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,040
You guys are going to take turns.

953
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,680
Each one of you has to describe a legitimate use

954
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,920
for a plunger that might actually arise in travel,

955
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,280
and through this method,

956
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,520
we will decide the winner of this particular debate.

957
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:15,760
Okay.

958
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,920
Griffin, I'm going to start with you.

959
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,720
Okay, you poop in a toilet, and you do a bad job,

960
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,280
and you have to undo your mistake.

961
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,320
Okay, Travis.

962
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,360
Uh, you need it to take down a bat,

963
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,800
so you swatted a bat with it.

964
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,360
Okay.

965
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,120
You have to, you get attacked by a dog,

966
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,160
and you have to use it to fight off the dog,

967
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,680
if that's a thing, if that's a concern.

968
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,000
No points for creativity, but the judges accept.

969
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,880
Travis, go on.

970
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,480
Someone else has a plunger,

971
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,560
and challenges you to a plunger duel at dawn.

972
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,360
Mm-hmm.

973
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,280
Griffin, you could challenge that.

974
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,080
Uh.

975
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,320
No, that's, no, that's, I'm going to let that one fly.

976
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:52,880
Okay.

977
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,680
Um, you, your traveler's checks get lost in the plane,

978
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,120
because the TSA stole them,

979
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,120
and so you have to sell the plunger for,

980
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,080
to get money for food.

981
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,960
It's also a gold plunger.

982
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,040
The plunger's gold, I'm sorry, the plunger's gold.

983
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,960
The plunger was given to you by an old wise man,

984
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,600
and it's enchanted, and it saves the day somehow.

985
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,680
It's a magic, my next, Travis,

986
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,360
literally my next thing was magic plunger.

987
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,640
Okay, so I think we can all agree on magic plunger.

988
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,840
Those two cancel each other out.

989
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,520
Um, you were too cheap to get on extreme restraints,

990
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,280
and buy an actual sex toy,

991
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,520
so you'd use the plunger for sex stuff.

992
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,960
There's, it's got two, it's got two,

993
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,720
it's got two pleasure ends, so.

994
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,280
Heads or tails?

995
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,280
Literally.

996
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,640
Travis, I want to end on that one.

997
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,560
Uh, so you concede.

998
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,320
I do concede that you could use the plunger as a sex toy.

999
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,640
If you're cheap, but it's not,

1000
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,320
it's not going to be the kind of high quality product

1001
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,160
you're going to find at extremerchains.com.

1002
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,640
Nope.

1003
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,840
With a coupon code MEDDLESS.

1004
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:58,560
Awesome.

1005
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,240
Fantastic.

1006
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,680
Helping, really helping people this week.

1007
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Really building some bridges, I feel like.

1008
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,240
Out of plungers.

1009
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,040
Oh, that's another one.

1010
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,280
Oh shit.

1011
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,560
God, Travis wins!

1012
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,520
God damn it.

1013
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,600
Pulled it out at the last minute.

1014
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,280
Which by the way, by the way,

1015
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,600
if you are using the plunger as a sex toy,

1016
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,960
don't wait until the last minute to pull it out.

1017
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,920
Why would a great poster, a poster campaign?

1018
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,040
Are you afraid of getting pregnant by the plunger?

1019
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,760
I don't understand.

1020
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,160
Yes.

1021
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,840
Why am I so turned on right now?

1022
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,880
Oh God, I want to end it.

1023
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,280
Should we end the show there?

1024
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,920
Yes.

1025
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,280
Yeah, we did a great show.

1026
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,160
Great program.

1027
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,400
Thanks.

1028
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,360
I feel good about it.

1029
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:43,760
Thank you.

1030
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,720
Thank you guys so much for, again,

1031
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,240
for supporting us through the Max Fund Drive.

1032
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,760
You really are heroes,

1033
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,040
and we hope that you enjoyed all the bonus content

1034
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,760
and stuff you got.

1035
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:54,880
We really appreciate-

1036
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,160
If you donated at the last minute,

1037
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,200
like if you donated on Sunday,

1038
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,560
the bonus content is still available if you're a donor,

1039
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,160
so it doesn't go away.

1040
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,960
Yeah, so you can totally treat yourself still.

1041
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,360
And thank you to people who are tweeting about the show,

1042
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,120
the Justin, Kambo Soup, Iggy K,

1043
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,400
of course, the Real Neor,

1044
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,360
Undodly G Thomas, Nana Gross,

1045
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,880
everybody who tweets about the show.

1046
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,000
If you do, make sure you use the NBNBGAM hashtag

1047
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,240
and throw a link to our sampler in there.

1048
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,680
And if you never watched it,

1049
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,560
go check it out.

1050
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,600
HTTP colon, forward slash, forward slash.

1051
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,040
So hold on, wait, what was that again?

1052
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,000
It's bit.ly forward slash, it's my bim bam.

1053
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,840
Bit.ly forward slash, it's my bim bam.

1054
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,040
What's the protocol though?

1055
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,560
What's the hyperlink?

1056
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,280
It is a hypertext transfer protocol.

1057
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,040
So thank you guys so much for your generosity.

1058
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,400
I wanna say a special thanks to everybody

1059
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
who grabbed Justin or I in the hallways

1060
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,960
of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center

1061
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,880
during PAX East this past weekend.

1062
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,120
We had a lot of fun

1063
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,040
and there were so many bim bam binos there showing support

1064
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,320
and it made my weekend, so thanks guys.

1065
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,440
I also wanna say a very special thank you

1066
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,760
to Heather Marion and Abigail McCauley

1067
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,800
who brought us at PAX a signed copy of Warriors

1068
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Into the Wild, the book about warrior cats,

1069
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,520
by Aaron Hunter, signed by Aaron Hunter to Bramblepelt.

1070
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,360
The signature reads, to Bramblepelt.

1071
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,280
The signature reads, to Bramblepelt.

1072
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,080
Meow, happy birthday, Aaron Hunter.

1073
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,040
Now wait, they had to tell, these fucking champions

1074
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,080
had to tell Aaron Hunter that the book is for a cat

1075
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,600
and this is what this, that's less weird

1076
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,560
than explaining the group.

1077
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,840
That's not how it panned out.

1078
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,280
They asked them, her, to sign it to Bramblepelt

1079
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,520
and Aaron Hunter made the logical leap, as anyone would,

1080
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,080
that they were getting the book signed

1081
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,320
for their cat whose birthday it was.

1082
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,840
Hey, Aaron Hunter, you're too deep in the game.

1083
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,400
You need to back up a little bit.

1084
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,240
You're too deep in the cat game, my friend.

1085
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,720
I wanna say also thanks, this is a very thankful

1086
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,880
closing segment, thank you to John Roderick

1087
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song

1088
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,280
Into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1089
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,360
It really starts the show off with a high energy,

1090
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,600
burst of energy and I don't know what we would be

1091
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,160
without it, we would be nothing, so thank you.

1092
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,840
I'd also like to thank everybody.

1093
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,080
I've noticed a lot on Twitter and I appreciate this

1094
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,240
and I know everyone else on the Max Fund Network does

1095
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,840
but seeing someone say like, I'm a fan of MBMBAM

1096
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,400
and they mentioned throwing shade, so now I'm a fan

1097
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,080
of throwing shade or people saying, I love

1098
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,000
Stop Podcasting Yourself and they introduce this

1099
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,680
to my brother, my brother and me.

1100
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,960
So if you haven't yet, coming off of the Max Fund Drive

1101
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,360
is a great time to go check out Judge Don Hodgman,

1102
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,640
Jordan Jesse Goh, Throwing Shade, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

1103
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,160
Bullseye, all the incredible shows on the Max Fund Network.

1104
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,200
You guys ready for the closer?

1105
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,480
Oh yes.

1106
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,360
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

1107
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,680
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user.

1108
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,080
Oh, it was deleted, so I don't know who asked it

1109
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,160
but the question was, how would you dance

1110
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,040
to I Only Want to Be With You by Hootie and the Blowfish?

1111
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,800
I'm Justin McElroy.

1112
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

1113
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1114
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1115
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,280
Kiss your dad.

1116
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,960
Square on the lips.

1117
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,200
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1118
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,720
Keep your heart, hey.

1119
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,400
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1120
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,680
Keep your heart, man.

1121
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,360
These girls are smart, three stacks.

1122
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,480
These girls are smart.

1123
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:08,800
I Only Want to Be With You by Hootie and the Blowfish.
