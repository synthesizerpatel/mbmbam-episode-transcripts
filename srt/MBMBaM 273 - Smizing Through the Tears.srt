1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
decision i'm gonna delete the last episode of the podcast from the internet because i was making

11
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,200
jokes i was making jokes with a t because that's what i've started to call them that's what tyler

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
calls them that's what tyra calls him because she just has to get as much tyra and stuff as

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,600
she possibly can i was making jokes at the expense of america's next top model cycle 2.2 or 22 depends

14
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,800
on who you ask boys in the house boys in the house boys still in the house boys are inextricable

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,800
from the house if i may interject boys please interject i didn't i have not kept up with

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,080
america's next top model boys well it's because you're a piece of shit and you don't care about

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,600
things that make me and justin happy but this is a rare opportunity it's just so real it's so nice

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,840
that we have someone here whose fault it is yeah yeah it's me that i can but let me ask you this

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,520
was it cancelled because uh of flagging quality was is the has the last season you know ty tyra

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,440
noticeably bad uh no you stupid piece of shit dumb dumb idiot flew too close to the sun yeah

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
and it was too close to perfection and god killed it well it sounds like tired tired put out a

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,040
statement on instagram on the ig platform uh that i'm sure she posted with her opal phone or whatever

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,040
and she posted it and was like i think cycle 22 is the last one that was her statement and as if

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,360
it was tyra's choice if it was our choice that's fine that's fine that's fine i'm starting to think

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,160
that there is maybe some external pressure maybe you saw i wanted to renegotiate his contract and

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
as a power move instead of renegotiating contract they just burned the whole fucking showdown around

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
him i don't know maybe miss jay maybe miss jay's tired of doing this maybe miss jay wants to become

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,080
an astronaut or something maybe miss jay just wants to focus on travel or something i don't

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,920
know and they just burn the showdown what if what if what if what if they're gearing up for 3.0 no

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,120
stop it don't even first of all that would mean cgi tire bags no that first of all that would mean

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,120
they were skipping eight seasons to jump directly to season 30 listen i'm i'm happy don't be sad

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
because it's gone be happy because you loved it in the first place and it was here and gave us 22

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,640
great years of programming but it's uh when tyra was just seven years old she started um yeah miss

34
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,920
banks is 29 and it's that's how she looks is uh basically it was the best show ever is ever on

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,880
television it was i was just hoping we could start oh it's uh by the way it's um my brother my brother

unfortunately she didn't want to didn't want to didn't wasn't contacted about it i want to tell

76
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,520
you the bet my favorite uh antm moment that i i think uh sydney and i have uh probably talked

77
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,960
about more than any other is um at one point um they were in i would assume africa uh it was one

78
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,600
of if you never watched uh the girls and sometimes the guys in the in the later years three beautiful

79
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:23,440
fucking seasons yeah for three perfect seasons uh they at the second the back half of the of the

80
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:36,720
season uh they would uh take the uh the girls or the guys to a an exotic locale um and in in

81
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:46,560
in one cycle uh it was uh cycle six if memory serves uh there was a an elephant in this challenge

82
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:57,280
uh and the girls were supposed to pose with the elephant uh and uh one of the models uh decided

83
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:08,000
she tried something a little crazy and uh she stood on an elephant's foot um and then the next

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,520
model saw that shot and then she stood on the elephant's foot as well for her shot and she got

85
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,640
called out on it by the other models and her defense was i i'm never gonna have an opportunity

86
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,760
like this again i just wanted to stand on an elephant's foot for once yeah still like it was

87
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,320
amazing like this was a lifelong dream that she finally finally uh uh being able to fulfill and

88
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,080
the other uh models are trying to rob her dear mom and dad it's finally happened it's happened

89
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,160
i think my favorite moment was in season i think don't you don't no you don't you haven't earned

90
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,120
this dare you i think the second episode someone in the house was murdered and the rest of the

91
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,400
season was a who done it with detective tyra i think that was my favorite that was the that

92
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,000
was the aborted abc series who done it and they only did one season of that which is also another

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,160
show tv crime and i cannot delve into this with you that show was a tv crime i agree with you

94
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,320
listen hi just it had something to do with the broken aquarium i didn't watch it that's literally

95
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
the first episode you watched a commercial for it once that might be true it all blends together i

96
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
think there were boys in that house too though i think there have been boys on a lot of houses

97
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,960
griffin travis right now yes you're running right now you're running your mouth like a lot of our i

98
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,520
love you dear listeners a lot of you guys when this shit when this horrible news dropped and

99
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,320
i was devastated and i got on twitter just like tearing open my heart and just squishing it down

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,960
on the internet and let everybody know just like where i was as a person i was really putting myself

101
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,000
out there and i got a lot of people like looks like no one's in the house and it's like do you

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
guys not do you not get it like do you not get the basic human like connection they used to have

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,680
with all of us we were doing this podcast in the hopes of someday being called on in a guest judge

104
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,200
maybe as part of a teach maybe like those brothers that taught the models the swirl remember the

105
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,760
swirl remember the swirl to teach i'm excluding myself from this uh because i would not qualify

106
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,880
what would you two teach the models travis they had twins named the a swirl twins that taught the

107
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:28,560
women how to swirl that was the whole teach um i could do i could teach them the stanky leg

108
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,320
let's move on to talking about questions that people have because honestly i can't do this

109
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
eulogy that we've been delivering i thought was going to be like weirdly liberating but no i'm

110
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,520
just this is just my life now is i'm just going to be sad about antiem forever if you know tyra

111
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,080
banks and you want to put this in front of her just to let her know about how her selfishness

112
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,280
or whatever happened has has just completely destroyed two human souls um uh please do that

113
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,120
uh you sigh what what what if we take this tragedy we turn it to opportunity we kick start

114
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:12,560
art season 23 we fund it we produce it independent we stream it on like crackle and it's all macaroi

115
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,640
funded okay i would feel really uncomfortable yeah i'm not gonna be too close to the art

116
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,160
no like if i had to like evaluate people's bodies and shit that no we wouldn't host it we wouldn't

117
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,600
oh i see we're just funded we're the money i'm not gonna step on tyra's intellectual property

118
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,840
yeah no she would keep doing it we're just giving her the money to keep doing it

119
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,840
i don't think the money was the issue let's move on i can't i can't even do

120
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,240
fun goofs about it it's the saddest thing that's ever happened ever when one change

121
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,280

122
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,440
changes their avatar or profile picture to support a worthy cause or to mourn a tragic event how long

123
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
should one wait before changing their profile back to some meaningless bullshit filled with

124
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,680
cats that's from supportive but don't want it to be my whole thing can i change is there any sort of

125
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,800

128
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,360
um i still have rainbow avatar on facebook for from when they uh made all all the marriage

129
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:44,720
great and when they fixed marriage yeah when they when they tweaked it um and uh i still have not

130
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,200
changed that back i pretty much i think i'm the last bastion because i'm i see i see everybody

131
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,760
i know who's changed it back like i wrote already huh yeah well okay i would just like they just

132
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,040
like fixed basically a homophobe i mean well i wouldn't say go that far it's just like your

133
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,680
priorities are maybe um not uh not not especially good it's like go royals here's my royals pride

134
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,320
here's me in a royals hat and it's like well that's fine and everything but i guess the thing

135
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,920
that's like more important to me is how like a whole like group of people were disenfranchised

136
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,960
and then like we sort of like fixed that it came together you know what the problem is huh we don't

137
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,960
have like a a profile picture palette cleanser like so say you switch your profile picture to

138
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,760
like support like anything you know what i you support like gay marriage right whatever you

139
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
change it to next people are like oh i guess you care about that more than that cost so what you

140
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,880
need is like just a neutral like beach shot like it's just a picture that everyone uses a picture

141
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,960

176
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,240
like 14 year olds would go to get their first hand job um but it is where hundreds of 14 year

177
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
olds went to get their first hand job because there's a dark room in the back of a sort of

178
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,120
gymnastics facility where you go train for gymnastics but then there's a dark stinky back

179
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,880
room where 14 year olds would go and be in the dark and just get wild on each other no alcohol

180
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,480
no drugs but all the hand jobs you can handle you know the show wild you know that show wild and

192
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,320

226
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:19,600
little bit of movie magic let me take you bts that was my asshole they did those extended scenes

227
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,600
completely unnecessary and contextless that was the year that we invented cgi i have fucking

228
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,440

231
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,720
right all of the passion that you got from that romance that was real passion and i can't i'm i'm

232
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,800
a great butt actor i can't fake that no that kind of butt chemistry you can't you can't learn that

233
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,640
Stanislavsky said that can't teach that butt chemistry i have a close friend who is falling

234
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,880
headfirst into what is so clearly a pyramid scheme and it's changed him noticeably in the

235
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,680
past few weeks he's always been a classic hippie stoner type but recently he's been dressing like

236
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,680
ward cleaver and speaking like a life coach he's also trying to get another friend and i to come

237
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,440
into what he calls dinners with the business and he paid up front what i expected thousands of

238
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
dollars to these people without knowing what he was getting into how does my how do my friend and

239
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,320
i get him to see that he's being sucked into something shitty that's from concerned in

240
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,800
connecticut you got to be careful about this because you know some people are getting rich

241
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:40,480
somehow and maybe this guy's plugged in somebody's got to be at the top of the pyramid yeah um also i

242
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,160
feel like you're very casually throwing pyramid scheme in there when i think that this is much

243
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,880
more likely a cult yeah for sure i got a real culty vibe i get real culty i think it's the um

244
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
the change of dress the ward cleaver very uh oh what if we're dealing with like a stepford

245
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,920
husbands or a stepford single guy i had a single guys i had a friend that i once thought was

246
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:09,440
getting into like a pyramid scheme she was selling uh uh well it doesn't matter but i it first went

247
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,920
to a party at her house where she was selling this stuff and i thought oh man i like this girl a lot

248
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,960
she's getting into a pyramid scheme i think i'm really worried about her flash forward to like

249
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,640
two years later she's fucking taking vacations to mexico and has an army of people working

250
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
underneath her like she's at the top of the pyramid you know somebody gets there

251
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
yeah somebody's gonna be at the top i mean i would say in your friend's defense if he's

252
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,160
making the transition from hippie stoner type to like dressing well and speaking positively

253
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,680
and doing a thing maybe just let it play out like yeah it doesn't sound like he had his shit

254
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,080
together to begin with now let me say this okay you missed the point where you can do anything

255
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,560
for this friend because they're already they are already like tens of thousands of dollars

256
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,480
in oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah what's he gonna do walk away you don't he's not getting a refund

257
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,160
you cannot walk away type friend get thousands of dollars well maybe throw away on dinners maybe

258
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,960
he's been saving up um but anyway that money's gone now and if he leaves now then tyra's gonna

listen has anybody actually made haterade like has anybody made it like he's gonna be taking

420
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,080
nobody owns that trademark right like could you buy some actual thing called haterade

421
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,320
haterade i'm pretty sure they wouldn't let you get that in the same way that they wouldn't let

422
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,200
me go out and they wouldn't let me trademark like joca cola because the sound they wouldn't let me

423
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,320
go out and they wouldn't let me trademark depsy which is a difference brown carbonated uh sugar

424
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:10,320
water for you to enjoy at home or diet depsy or pie it would actually be pie at depsy you could

425
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,200
probably though get patrick dempsey to be your spokesman for depsy hi everybody this is patrick

426
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,280

455
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,680

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,120
coach it's uh third and one uh um punt uh definitely punt are you sure where is anybody

461
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,720

out there please god don't win this game it's another it's another zero zero game in quintuple

464
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,720
overtime these coaches seem very nervous the coaches are standing back to back in the center

465
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:39,120
of the field circling protecting one another they've crafted spears out of the down markers

466
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,480
it's their only natural defense oh shit

467
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,920
and now and now an interview with bill belichick bill uh tell us about the secret to victory today

468
00:47:49,920 --> 00:48:00,000
because he's been melted down okay what's he a coach yeah fuck yeah

469
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,760
got it from downtown put a sports one right in the bucket oops there's another one looks

470
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:16,560
like i'm deep in the paint three sports jokes how come you never see coach like if it cold or hot

471
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,480
if i was a coach the game is going well like you'd have to find me like i think if especially if the

472
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,480
score's high i'll think well they've got it from here i'm gonna go if any coaches are listening

473
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,600
the next time somebody dumps gator i want you to turn around smack them in the face yeah how dare

474
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:41,440
no um if i was a coach yeah what's so fucking funny about that tribes you think it's un

475
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,080
unbelievable i could coach a team no it's just more this dreamlike way in which you said it

476
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:53,200
if i was a coach you know what i'd do when i am coach when griffin coach guys when i am

479
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,440
when i am coach of team

480
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,080
when i am sports boss

481
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,400
when i am president sports when i would do when i'm the points mayor

483
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,760
i would not let that shit fly are you kidding me i need to be respected because if i don't

484
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,160
have to respect then they're just gonna do their own plays out there that's like they can't they

485
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,200
need to do my plays that's why teams only ever win one super bowl because they start practice

486
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,080
the next year and every player on that team is thinking i dumped some sticky juice on your head

487
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,680
yeah remember that you don't have nothing on me i don't respect no sticky coach you're probably

488
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,560
still sticky right now aren't you coach let me let me touch you oh sticky boy who's a sticky boy

489
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:22,160
there's a power beat residue oh shit i've always considered myself a fashionable guy

490
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,120
but as i approached my mid-30s i find myself questioning if i can still rock new fashion

491
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,720
trends so you've come to the right place should i pull off a flat brim baseball cap with a brightly

492
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,600
colored shirt or should i hang it all up and just rock the hallway less like a runway and more like

493
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,880
a hallway that's from mid-30s swagger well now i'm thinking about ntm again so thanks

494
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:52,800
dude you know what you do you look to one man that man is jay-z okay okay he transitioned

497
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,240
suit and tie guy now that's a transition you get to make it 30 i certainly appreciate jay-z's

498
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,040
style and his art and everything about him but i i get nervous about i get nervous about my own

499
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,800
authenticity when i do anything new with my luck i went to the gap are you more of a pitbull man

500
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,360
no i'm saying i fell into the gap yesterday and um i was with a group of my friends today having

501
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,480
brunch and i referenced the juliet lewis commercial where she's dancing with the daft punk robots

502
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,880
and they all looked at me like i was a psychopath that mood i feel like everybody knows that

503
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,360
commercial right i didn't invent it in my mind in a dream state did i i didn't pass through the

504
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:54,640
anyway griffin i love you i've never heard of this god no fuck fuck okay anyway uh i went to

505
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,920
the gap yesterday because i had to buy some khakis because i was uh going to a wedding

506
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:05,040
and i saw these brown jeans and they looked tight legged and i said get those fucking jeans and i

507
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,360
did i did get those fucking jeans and i put them on i thought they looked good and i thought they

508
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,880
really uh encased my meat in a nice way that was pleasing to my eye but it's new like i don't own

509
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,280
tight pants and i certainly don't own brown jeans that and that small like that modicum of change

510
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,400
was enough to make me worry like my friends are gonna see me like what are you doing wearing these

511
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,280
tight brown jeans idiot that's not that's not your style you wear things with like those little

512
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,560
loops on them that you put hammers in even though you're not like a guy who uses hammers every

513
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,600
that's your that is your look cargo cargo boy there's another man to look to here griffin

514
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,320
that's bruno mars i can't okay you keep referencing people that like i can't look

515
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,480
i can't you know what okay there's two different kinds of style and i can't have that on a pink

516
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,800
colored t shirt but hear me out there's two kinds of style right there is like uh uh world style

517
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,040
there's like the fashionable trend style and there's personal style which i think is deeply

518
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:04,000
respected more so in mid-30s than that like trendy style that idea of like oh that's a guy

519
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,920
who like has figured it all out for himself yeah it's just exhaust it's either exhausting because

520
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,960
you have to keep evolving that personal style because if you don't the other thing happens which

521
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,440
is just like you get hemmed in to a look and like i don't want to put justin on blast but justin

522
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,400
you've got a very personal style when i see you i say that's justin i'm not confused with you

523
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,560
not confused about who it is because at this point like i know your personal style how would you

524
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:37,120
describe it um mostly just like um cool vacation dad cool vacation dad yeah for sure for sure but

525
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,560
i and i don't want to criticize you and i don't want to like i i again keep in mind there's no

526
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,680
i mean i couldn't care less that's also part of your style is showy hipster cowboy showy hipster

527
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,680
cowboy is definitely travis's thing me i'm just sort of amorphous clothes horse but what i but

528
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,160
driven's an inscrutable blob i might you can't wrap your mind around me but just what i'm saying

529
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,200
is i feel like you're not your look hasn't evolved nor will it first okay and you're okay with that

530
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,200
you're cool at that well i i spend that time it takes x number of seconds to think about

531
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,640
how your clothes make you look this is the this is the opening i'm just i'm just quoting the opening

532
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,040
of jesse thorns put this on but let me just encapsulate for you it takes x number of seconds

533
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,720
to think about how you look if you decide you're not going to think about anymore that's a lot of

534
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,920
free thinking seconds that you got to think about how much you miss antm for example that's god yeah

535
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,920
see and now i'm looking maybe i should get into fashion just to fill my fucking days with anything

536
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,080
other than the weeping and gnashing of my own my style my style icon is paul f tompkins because

537
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,960
there was a time when that man was podcasting 23 and a half hours out of every day the fact that

538
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,240
he wore pants at all is a personal triumph and he single-handedly he walked into the podcasting

539
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,680
community say hey we don't all have to dress like dipshits just because we record podcasts

540
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,720
and he elevated the game guy looks fresh fucking every time i see him he is also a self-described

541
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,920
late bloomer and like you can like look back over his career and he has not always been

542
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,520
the trendy motherfucker that he is now like he at some point in his adult life went you know what

543
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,760
i'm gonna choose my look and i'm sticking with it i just find it really hard to i'm i'm like not to

544
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,760
turn this into a pity party but i'm i'm an overweight gentleman there's a in my in the

545
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,240
visage department there's a lot of work i have to do to get my look right that that is not relate

546
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,920
it right now me spending a lot of money on clothes would be like buying diamond paint for a house

547
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,680
where the pipes are falling out the windows like it doesn't make sense yeah you're so trust me on

548
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,880
this when we took you don't get to tell me i'm wrong we took you to that men's jacket store

549
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,440
yeah we all tried on jackets and we looked good we look good we look good and then you know what

550
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,720
you know what didn't happen then after that travis um about five minutes in our podcast i took the

551
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:06,480
jacket off you know why because i was sweating i was sweating everywhere that's what i think

552
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,200
every when we went to max fun con and paul thomkins was there john roderick was there

553
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,240
and john hodgeman was there and you look at these three dudes who are like wearing suits and looking

554
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,880
real good real fly and it was hot as shit i was in a t-shirt and shorts and sweating no yeah you

555
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,880
gotta risk it for the biscuit that is for sure travis that is the most essential element of

556
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,520
fashion is pleasure is pain and i agree with you there do you remember the uh uh cincinnati live

557
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,640
show when i believe his name was cole cole asked about like having a uniform where he was like

562
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:12,240
pretty real huh i just yeah i mean like anytime i i do think there is an element also to be considered

563
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,440
this like and people say well you know if you just comb the straight like there's a there's a

564
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,360
financial aspect of this question too right like there's a financial there's a lot of different

565
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,800
aspects this question but like i think we can't we can't ignore the fact that like when we bought

566
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,280
those jackets we took them off during our show because it was 250 fucking degrees up there we

567
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,200
were basically performing inside of an easy bake oven but it was it was you felt good when you

568
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,080
bought that jacket you put it on you look to yourself say hey there's a new look and i look

569
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:42,000
good in it just go to the gap sometimes just go just drink it in fall into the gap and just like

570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,960
take a look around and say i don't own this and this would probably look good on me and then just

571
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:54,640
try it on and then buy it at the gap please support the gap the gap needs you now more than ever

572
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:03,760
