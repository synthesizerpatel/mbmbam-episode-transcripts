1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660

The sky because they're all here celebrating their November 8th birthdays now

26
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,140
I do want to say when the episode comes out. It will be November 7th. Yeah

27
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,460
What's your plan? Also the last time your guys birthday fell on an election day. It was a big stinker Rudy, wasn't it?

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,060
Hey, thanks for reminding me bud. I totally didn't remember that. Thank you

29
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,260
Just saying and it's for me to remember

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,260
Yeah that I had that election day is November 8th because I'm not thinking about that every second

31
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,860
Well, the only thing is you guys are like is the best day and I'm like it could you guys are in a panic spiral

32
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,940
Right now and I am too, but mine is no I'm just mad at you Griffin. Don't misread my body language

33
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,820
Mine's not attached to the birthday like my birthday is gonna be great. Jesus died dire

34
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,700
consequences

35
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,860
potentially

36
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,700
But that's that's fine. That's the great

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,460
I will receive the the greatest present for this birthday and Travis will likely receive it, too

38
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
and you know what Griffin you'll even

39
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,620
Get to get to open this one and that's that John Ossoff will get off my nuts

40
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
Uh

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,660
James Carville will retrain he'll take his talons out of my nuts. Yeah

42
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,620
Where I'm not gonna say who cuz I don't want people like telling me about them

43
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,460
But somebody who has reverend at the start of their name emails me nine times a day not an exaggeration

44
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,540
Fresh nice memes from the rev

45
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,860
Like I'm expecting to get like a hey man. Uh, what do you do it?

46
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,660
Can I borrow a game you've been playing? I'm bored as hell man fucking I am

47
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,780
Always getting texts and emails from James Carville asking to borrow my video games. He's like

48
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,500
Red Dead Redemption 2 and I'm like that game came out a long time ago

49
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,100
He's like you got it on Xbox 360 and it's like, why are you I don't even know

50
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,100
They came out on Xbox 360 I often worry madden 10 with me

51
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,180
I often worry that Elizabeth Warren is going to for some reason

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,340
Actually personally text me and tell me like she ran out of gas and needs my help

53
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,260
But it's just gonna pop up in my thing is the notification will just say hey Travis

54
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,260
It's me Elizabeth Warren and I'll ignore it and she'll be sitting there like where is he?

55
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,860
I I only had enough energy to text one person and Travis was the last person I texted asking for money

56
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,420
Where is he? You know, here's how I never considered

57
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,540
Do you think that people Elizabeth Warren texts in her day-to-day life?

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,140
Do you think she is frequently getting responses to her personal text messages? They're like fuck. Oh

59
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,500
Yeah, he stopped please unfollow stop to end unsubscribe

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,580
What this is your wife unsubscribe now, it's really James Carville and I really want to borrow your Xbox. I have eight cell phones

61
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,620
That's why I'd always come from a different number. That's what you would that's what you would say James

62
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,340
Subscribe. I'm standing right in front of you. I got tricked by one last week and the the opener of the text was

63
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,460
Tragic update deeply sad about Mark Kelly. It's like oh

64
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,280
Dog died and that one I did pop open. They got me on that one. Yeah

65
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,260
so that's

66
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,580
Please vote. I mean we got it. You know, we have we're gonna say that and you already did vote but like vote good

67
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,080
You know, I mean good do a good job. I guess the right way to write

68
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,120
Fuck who knows man, you know, this isn't political advice

69
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:26,660
You should vote for people that think the outcome of the election is valid. Yes. Yeah, that's a good start

70
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,740
That's a good start. That's not political vote

71
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,020
That's just like and listen visible. I'm gonna take a bowl political stand both of the people that aren't complete dipshits

72
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,320
Yeah, this is this is that's too much. That's two political arms. You're choosing between two dipshits less of a dipshit then

73
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,500
Anyway

74
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,620
Happy birthday. I'm sorry that it got a little bit away from the main topic. Anyways back to our birthday. Thank you

75
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,380
You're a balloon drop. Yeah, Travis and I are Travis. What are you?

76
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,180

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm gonna turn guys 42 the nerds are gonna love this one

78
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,040
Griffey juniors baseball number I think 42. Yeah, so I that's the last that's the last like

79
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,400
Big one for 27 years. Yeah, and then you roll up into 60

80
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm looking to see if that was Ken Griffey juniors

81
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,100
A jersey number cuz I'll be really impressed with myself. You could Travis our audience. You just say it is sure

82
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,340
Yeah, it was literally nobody knows or is going to fact-check that or knows how to fact-check that. Oh, it absolutely was not

83
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Like he played for several different

84
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,540
Teams and it wasn't on any of them. Okay. Hey, never mind. Hey, hey, look over there

85
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,500
It's an advice show for the modern era. Let's bring that over here. Yes. Welcome. Welcome to our advice show

86
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,660
We're so happy to have you here for this birthday celebration

87
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,180
Celebration celebration. Mm-hmm. We're having a regatta for our birthday this year

88
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,580
We're calling it a birthday celebration guys here in Cap City. It's buzzing. There's ever what is it?

89
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,280
Cap City, this is what we call it here in capsaicin here in capsaicin. It's buzzing people are

90
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
buzzing about our birthday

91
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,060
About your birthday and about Election Day the schools here take two days off for Election Day for our birthday

92
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,860
For Travis's birthday is on Monday and Justin's birthday. They take Tuesday off. Yeah, we take turns. They take time to really observe it

93
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,140
I'm just want you all to know it's electric. It's electrifying. Is that what is the energy like they're electric and electrifying?

94
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:38,580
People are just out on the street always now and the parties go all night long. This is like our this is like our day

95
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,060
Do you know what I mean? Like are you guys allowed to vote? Have you thought about that?

96
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:50,700
Yes, but the ballot is like a Shoney's kids menu and it's like do you think chocolate milk is good and we say

97
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,620
We say yes, it is and they say do you want would it be cool to have people like in Congress for you?

98
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,820
And we're like, yes. Yes, that's really that would be very cool. And they're like, okay, but how many pancakes do you want?

99
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,100
And you know, I say three and it doesn't it then they take it and they say thank you

100
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,180
They gave me the sticker. They put the menu right in the garbage can. Oh

101
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,020
Do you at least get one of those lollipops where like the stick is a loop at the end?

102
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:24,340
I do get a safety pop, which is oh, that's nice. Yeah, cuz I you know, I can't be trusted to vote for

103
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,540
members of Congress

104
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,380
But I so I clearly can't be trusted to eat like a dum-dum a tootsie roll pop a charms blow pop

105
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:39,340
Cuz it's going right down the windpipe. Yeah, but and like you're running and you trip in that stick. Whoo boy

106
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,860
That's dangerous, but we're all having a ton of fun over here. It's a fucking party non-stop. Oh

107
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,860
Cool energy. I love it. And I love your questions. That's what we're gonna answer for you right now in this podcast

108
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,780
Which begins now, uh, I dog sit as a side hustle. I

109
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,020
I don't think you should announce that to the people who you are dog sitting before

110
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,740
Yeah, but I think you should just frame it differently. Anyway, a dog sit is a side hustle

111
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,500
I don't currently have my own dog and I'm not actively looking to adopt but I really love a few of my regular dog clients

112
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm wondering if there's a chill way I could tell their people that if anything were ever happened to them

113
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Yeah, go on I would look I

114
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,980
Would love to adopt them sort of like a dog godmother. Yep

115
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,180
It's not that there's something better we could do there

116
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,500
We're gonna circle back on the dog godmother cuz I'm not loving it or something there and there's some confusing pronoun stuff in there

117
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,900
Just to be clear what you're saying is I love the dogs and I want to let the people know that if anything happens to

118
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,220
The people I'll take the dogs. Okay

119
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,500
Okay, so is there a chill way to ask about that without it sounding like a tacit threat

120
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,460
Nice dog you got there would be a shame if something happened to you

121
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
in upstate New York

122
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,820
Listen

123
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:13,300
Listen when it's sad thing, but when pets owners die don't go on the Rainbow Road

124
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,620
Yeah, when they go, it's the Rainbow Ridge, isn't it?

125
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,080
Rainbow Road is in Mario humans do it. We go on the Rainbow Road

126
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,900
When they get hit by that blue shell on the Rainbow Road and you jump the fence on the first lap

127
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,420
And you land on the lower part of the Rainbow Road and just fucking skook your dumbass cousins

128
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,700
And you're like being Ted's awesome

129
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
That we do it is

130
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,020
Standard practice that the pets are buried with them with the owners

131
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,300
Yes

132
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,180
like a pharaoh like a pharaoh so they can protect us when

133
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,460
Charon tries to ferret us across the River Styx and we're like, I'm not I would rather actually

134
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,980
Actually hit the Rainbow Road right now. I would have way more fun with that than in your

135
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:10,780
Slow ass canoe death. Nice. Try. I'm that's why you you do need to challenge death to some Mario Kart when you get down

136
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,140
There to return or or you could do smash if that's your thing

137
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,860
But it's Mario Kart and smash are the only two games that he's got down there. Yeah on GameCube

138
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,980
So it's in a sad and it's sad, but you need when the hellbats come at you

139
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,740
You're gonna need that dog with you or kitty cat kitty cats. I'm not well

140
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,740
Kitty cats not gonna do much the weird the weird part of the conversation will not be the initial opening

141
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,820
It's a little macabre, but I think most people would be like, yeah, you know what if I die

142
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,740
you got my cat my dog, but

143
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,340
What is step two?

144
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,860
Mm-hmm, because there's a couple different ways it plays out

145
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,940
one is

146
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Beth call her Beth

147
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,260
dies and then you show up at the funeral would be like

148
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,340
This is this may seem odd

149
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,540
But it is actually chill Beth said that if she died I can have the dog

150
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,300
So I'll go ahead and take that with me. No problem. That's how she won. I should too is the owner is like I

151
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,940
Guess I need to call

152
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
My lawyer. Yeah to put it in the will

153
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,460
That you have my dog. Is that not a normal thing cuz I have in my will no joke

154
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,640
Where my dogs go or something happens?

155
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,340
Yeah

156
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,940
I mean because mostly I knew it wasn't Justin or Griffin and I wanted to make that super clear. They're going to dad

157
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:47,120
Enjoy Carol, you're gonna love it one more on the pile baby more baby. That's four dogs total or something happened today

158
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh, no, I can see out trust his window dad has showed up outside his house of the baseball bat

159
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,280
He's just protecting him with his life. He's buying Travis granola and grapes dad is bad at nutrition

160
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,000
But Travis, but you did that already, right

161
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,720
What I'm saying is great while I'm watching you. Could you please call your lawyer and tell them to draft a new will please?

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,200
Thank you. I don't know how to tell you this question. That's good. But this like if I if something happens to me

163
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,980
I'm leaving whatever to whoever is not normally a gig economy related, right?

164
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
like because

165
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
It could happen anytime

166
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,840
Not to me, of course

167
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,080
But to other people and so this idea of like it could happen five years from now you've moved

168
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,520
You like you went somewhere else and it's just like hey, I need you to find this person and give them my dog

169
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh

170
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,080
you could probably do okay by like

171
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,080
Showing the dog how to get to your house. Oh, yeah, maybe if you could persuade the dog to incredible journey. Yes

172
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,760
Okay, you know you like just you the motion the wheels are already now

173
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Hold on Justin Lee. It's been a while since I've seen the incredible journey homeward bound the incredible journey

174
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,280
But I don't believe it was well looks like it's time for me to move on

175
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Let me check this napkin with a map on it. Damn the whole family beefed it, huh?

176
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Dog walker, I really liked it. Think she's in Poughkeepsie. Do you guys know how to get there?

177
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Can we start moseying along? I'll find it

178
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,680
Hey, remember me my whole family died. Can I stay with now? Okay. Oh fuck. Well, oh you got your own dog in the last eight

179
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,480
Years bummer. Okay, this this look, you know what? I'm getting out the step. This is weird

180
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Sorry, we tried everything

181
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,020
We gave it the old college, but that one's just weird. I'm sorry. You can't do it. Can't do that one

182
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Can't do that one. Can we do it? Can we go to the wizard though? Yeah, cuz yeah, it's not

183
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:09,640
really Halloween anymore, but if you wanted to have like a darkness a dark sort of I was gonna invite the wizard to

184
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Thanksgiving no

185
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
No, he's still thinking a lot about

186
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,920
He's still thinking a lot about Halloween. There's a huge banner ad for

187
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,560
Kate Blanchett's tar on

188
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,360
My on my screen that I can't get rid of and it's like half the screen

189
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,400
When I do it here roof when I need to it here roof tiles or stop one of the wet bandits

190
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,760
I only reach for one brand and that's Kate Blanchett's

191
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,440
a

192
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,920
Lot of people said it was strange for me Kate Blanchett to it create my own line of tar

193
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
but when other tars on the

194
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,040
target

195
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,500
You don't know what's in my heart. You don't know what's in my heart. You don't know what's on my roof

196
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,820
I think is what I settled for but tar is my passion. It's the stickiest pitch imaginable

197
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
I can catch Cinderella on this thing

198
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,460
I've spent two decades perfecting Kate Blanchett's

199
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,340
Everything else has been funding for this moment my little secret. It's delicious

200
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,540
It's great on your roof great on toast enjoy

201
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,500
This is how to act evil a villain is usually the most fun character to play

202
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,220
But making that kind of evil truly scary and believable takes hard work

203
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,460
If you aren't sure how to act evil for your role

204
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,940
It helps to start from the outside and work inward once you have the perfect look for your evil character

205
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,500
You'll be able to focus on creating a sinister persona

206
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,280
Just I will I want to just create a little asterisk there and say

207
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,480
Evil character most fun to play little asterisk down the bottom except Deadpool because it looks like mr

208
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
Reynolds is having a blast with that character. Yeah

209
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
So it seems like it's a

210
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
villain except Deadpool at the bottom

211
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,340
So here's the first step and it is to choose the right clothing evil is

212
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,040
for the

213
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,780
For the photo on this one for a little doodle for a little illustration

214
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,260
They have a dude like pulling off a t-shirt

215
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
but it's not like

216
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,860
Really germane to what the question is about

217
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,460
and

218
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,240
I'm gonna I'll slack the image to you guys cuz it's it's like it's like that's what you guys went with is just like

219
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,380
Here wear dark clothing because that's the you know traditional clothing of a bad boy

220
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,620
But like then they sent this

221
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,100
He's

222
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,960
He's like cut and huh? Yeah

223
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,540
It's like choose the right clothing evil is typically associated with dark foreboding colors

224
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,220
So when you're playing a costume for a villainous character, that's the color palette that you should start with

225
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,940
Well this this drawing is like a photo they took too soon

226
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,540
It's like they started drawing it and the guy they were drawing wasn't ready

227
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,020
Yes, it's it's you could see okay

228
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,860
So you see a chest and then hands are pulling a shirt almost all the way off and the face

229
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,220
We're on it is a dark color. That's true. Yeah, it's probably putting on a dark color

230
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:21,180
What a bizarre time to draw this this guy. Yeah, and let's step out. Let's not this isn't

231
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,520
This is not how to do a costume. I think people who come to this article looking for help want to be

232
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
a real baddie and

233
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,460
So you've got to consider the genre of that you want to be when planning your costume you have to take the type

234
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,460
That of seeing you're working in so as the time period into account for example

235
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,340
While a villain in a Western and evil character in a futuristic sci-fi play might both wear black

236
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,100
The outfits will likely be very different

237
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,140
otherwise man

238
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:55,180
I wish there really was a futuristic sci-fi play all plays I go to is just like people singing about like their

239
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,740
Newspaper well going good dad just went and saw back in London, which is a pretty futuristic sci-fi play if you ask me

240
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,260
Oh, yeah, unless you know about something that I don't vis-a-vis

241
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,620
Like time travel. Well, no, it's just like that the time that he goes to in the future in that movie

242
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,800
We already did do that one. So like I would argue that's not so much future sci-fi

243
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,260
But if there was one where like spaceship was there and like they had like a Star Wars

244
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,060
Muse like play with like lightsabers and like Jedi babes and like all that. Oh, yeah cool shit

245
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,780
Um, well Griffin, I'm sorry that that's not actually futuristic because I don't know if you know

246
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
The Star Wars actually happened a long time ago

247
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Okay, but you know what? I mean like

248
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,580
Historical fiction add sinister accessories

249
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
like a spiky

250
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,780
Eyepatch spiky collar spiky collar chain wallet chain wallet chain sinister, right? Yeah

251
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Vans

252
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Fucking jinko jeans

253
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Yeah

254
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
some goggles

255
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,060
Jamiroquai hat jamiroquai style beliefs jamiroquai faith

256
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,340
All it really takes guys is a mustard seed of jamiroquai faith

257
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,220
That's how you walk on walls and on the ceiling you just have to believe

258
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,580
True go for sleek hair. There may be a variety of hairstyles that work

259
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,380
Well for your character a sleek slick back do is usually a traditional look for a evil character

260
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,220
Pomades work best when slicking back short hair clay base for a while generalization

261
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,460
Is it it is like maybe like a 60-40 split? I don't know. It's

262
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm gonna cut ahead. Well do develop a menacing stare. That's the last

263
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,740
Yeah, avoid looking away. I'm blinking. It's hard, but if it was easy to be evil baddy then

264
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:57,140
Everyone do it if I could do that if I was capable that I'd probably be doing a lot better like socially

265
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,020
You know I mean like oh, yeah

266
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,460
That's my bat like I can't yeah if I could stare into people's eyes

267
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,780
For more than a second or two without having to then look away

268
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,980
I wouldn't need to be a evil guy

269
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:15,500
Yeah, I could be if I wasn't always always always staring at people's eyebrows. Yeah, I wouldn't have to look directly into their eyes

270
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,580
And they would see yeah it

271
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,980
Let's get fun the magic nature let's have audio fun though because this is sounding the part

272
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,860
Make your voice deeper while a specific character might call for a certain type of voice villains

273
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,820
Traditionally have deep throaty voice that makes them sound evil if you have a naturally deep voice you probably don't have to alter it much

274
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,220
However if your voice tends to be higher pitch try to give it a lower more menacing sound

275
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,780
That means you speak universally true like her deeper

276
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,900
Travis please do sorry. It's universally. This is also like Batman voice though. This is well

277
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,900
That means the Batman's evil to the Joker's of the world. That's a good point good. That's a good point Griffin

278
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,700
Hello, brothers, so let's do a practice

279
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Whoa shit

280
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,780
Whoa that wasn't me. I don't know what that wasn't burp the alphabet. I'll get you next time gadget

281
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,420
That's my doctor why don't you you got to do more car seat that's right painful isn't it? Oh?

282
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,540
Yeah, I can do it for about three seconds. Yeah

283
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,180
It is literal vocal fry it fries the inside of my throat

284
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,660
Sure identify your chest register by saying the word

285
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:33,420
Whoa in as deep a voice as you can keep your hand on your chest as you speak to feel the vibrations repeat the exercise

286
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,260
Several times it may help to record yourself, so you can listen back to what your voice sounds like we're doing that

287
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,860
okay, I'll just you know like put your hand on your chest and just like

288
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Yeah, go ahead juice

289
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,220
Hello, Dan on your chest and on chest and say whoa were you paying attention whoa?

290
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Wow, that's really deep

291
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,180
Whoa whoa wow

292
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,100
That really works that really works

293
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,580
Holding it here. That's that's really low. That's really that's really low

294
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,540
It sounds this is some of our worst audio yet perfect a menacing laugh really good. That's so cool though

295
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,300
I didn't know I could do that. I'm glad you're having fun with your I'm glad your villain arc has begun

296
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Justin doesn't well you have to be evil cuz your voice can do that wait until there's villains in the Avenger zone

297
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,060
Siebel chase you guys are gonna appreciate. Yeah, you're freak out. Hey, hey Justin. Please don't break that voice out. It's too scary

298
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,140
It's too scary. Can you all perfect a menacing laugh for me? Yeah?

299
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,420
No wait, but do it like you did

300
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,220
Low yeah, it's got to be low. It's hard to laugh low

301
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
I

302
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,020
Actually think the most evil thing you can do is to respond like in this way, that's funny. Oh, that's so funny

303
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,300
You're a really funny person. I didn't know you were a comedy guy

304
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,240
Emphasize why didn't they call family guy comedy guy if it's gonna be mostly Joe. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks juice

305
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,300
emphasize the right words when you're trying to act evil the way you speak your lines is almost as important as the lines themselves a

306
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,620
Villainous character should emphasize words that have a threatening connotation or mock the other characters for example if you tell another character

307
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
You may want to make sure you say

308
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:26,140
With a hard edge, so it sounds like you're really twisting the knife or we could hit it another way you're pathetic

309
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,500
I don't care what anyone don't say I'm not pathetic. You're you're the pathetic one

310
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,700
I didn't say you were pathetic. I know but I could see it in your eyes

311
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,100
Look at me like I was pathetic, but I'm not hey, man

312
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,340
Listen, I don't want to diagnose, but uh you won't talk about it

313
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:58,540
Yeah, what did you say?

314
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:14,740
Give layers to your anger a evil character likely carries a great deal of rate. I'm getting lightheaded from doing

315
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
You can't do every single health

316
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,820
Uncontrolled anger instead try to give shades to your characters evil rage according to the story for example in an early scene you may just

317
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,020
Glare at another character to convey your low-key anger however as you approach the climb. I want to hear me convey my low-key anger. Yeah sure

318
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,580
Gosh darn it Thor

319
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,620
Make sure you understand what the character is angry about in every scene. Oh hold on wait stop

320
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,320
I gotta stop you right there wiki how cuz you know how every time

321
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,680
Anyone plays any Batman villain it does like fuck them up like?

322
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:57,600
Yeah, yes, yes, Paul Dano still has to like sleep with all of the lights on yeah, and I surround his head

323
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,440
It's because he thought like it wasn't just like I'm I'm gonna pretend to be the Riddler

324
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,520
It was also like but why is the Riddler so angry, but then that seeps into Paul Dano, right?

325
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,160
And he's like I want to punish people with puzzles. Well. This is why if you're a screenwriter

326
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,960
I don't want to give you notes, but it helps to like write in just directly into the script in like

327
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,600
Parentheses like you're angry here, and then it's like I don't have to understand it. You just told me. That's great

328
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,880
I know exactly how to read in fact if you could just start screeners start every line with a parentheses of like angry angry

329
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,640
happy

330
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,020
Horny anyway, so I don't have to like

331
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,680
Internalize it in any way whatsoever. I would love that that would be great in my acting work

332
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Enjoy the pain of others part of being truly evil satisfaction enjoy the pain of others enjoy the pain of others when you're trying to act

333
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,800
Evil it's important to show how much joy your character gets when other people suffer and convey that even when you don't have any lines

334
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,600
That spell it out. Oh now wiki house kind of given you

335
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,900
Permission carte blanche to eat up scenery in the back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you don't need to make it always about you

336
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,340
Yeah, like yeah when in like this in sci-fi

337
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:17,800
Future in Jupiter ascending the stage musical when the dog man like breaks up with Jupiter, and she's like

338
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You can't be in the background like

339
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Like cuz then you'll get yelled at

340
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:29,800
That actually got me fired as a zombie extra in walking dead. I'm somebody who get hurt my zombie will go

341
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,540
You're like the zombies don't really laugh Travis if you could not and I'm like ah, but what is more?

342
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,020
And you and you shout it out like fuck him up a zombie Michael and they're like, that's not

343
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,780
The show works like well

344
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,380
I was just trying to deepen like the bond between the zombies and maybe we could have some scenes or just the zombies interacting

345
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,680
Like that's not really what we do and I'm like, maybe it's time to change you've been going 19 seasons

346
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,180
Go ahead juice. I will say just for the purposes of argument though

347
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,180
If you learn to derive joy from the pain of others

348
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:08,140
And you can still derive joy from the happiness of others. It sounds like a pretty nice life. You'd be you're pretty happy

349
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,140
Sounds like you've got a recipe for being happy all the time. I mean if everyone does it

350
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,180
Stinks, but one or two would have different

351
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,260
Yeah, I'm just saying like if there were more villains in movies and TV shows that just seemed happy all the time

352
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,460
Yeah, that's so bad because like Lex Luthor seems kind of annoying

353
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,380
shit Travis

354
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,700
Top community Q&A. I want to be evil, but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. What can I do?

355
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,300
You can be evil in a broad sense seek world domination instead of hurting people individually

356
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,540
The best evil is insidious and seems good. For example in DC Comics Lex Luthor is not evil in his own mind

357
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,700
He's looking out for the good of humanity against the evil alien who has come from Krypton to enforce his vision of justice on our world

358
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,580
Yeah, he's not explicitly evil just xenophobic and racist. He's bad in a lot of ways

359
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,260
He doesn't murder banks

360
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,460
He's like in that top point one percent of wealth and he could be doing way more with his money

361
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,340
Instead he runs for president and hates illegal aliens

362
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,940
Find some humanity for the characters the last tip don't do that. That's weak shit

363
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,340
I hate that shit when it's like in Lord of the Rings when Sauron is like, you know, this is my puppy

364
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,120
He's like I'm just doing it for my daughter. It's like I don't man

365
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,860
I was really enjoying like I tell you you want me roof for now, right exactly that's your to her

366
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,620
Okay, man, cuz then it's like when Frodo cuts his fucking head off, right? That's I'm then am I supposed to feel?

367
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,460
Confused about that Samwise is like doing the like, you know, I'm crouching over you

368
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,620
So it looks like I'm farting on you and putting my butt on your face because we beat you

369
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,540
Yeah, I want to cheer for that wholeheartedly. I don't want to have a moment of like well

370
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,080
But like his daughter was kidnapped or whatever. Mr. Freeze is the perfect example

371
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,780
Yeah, you never ever ever see mr. Freeze like

372
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,860
Making a throne of ice living it up enjoying frozen foods like that's not him every time you see this other fucker

373
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:17,680
It's always like single crack in my globe frozen tears on the ground probably a rose. Yeah, I'm really sad

374
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,940
It's like such a bummer and I've written some poems. Oh, I wrote I wrote poems and he's like

375
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,780
He's like, but my wife died. It's like yeah, a lot of people's wives died

376
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,600
Yeah, as if your hair died because of your cold gun you made. Yeah. Yeah. Hey

377
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,520
Since we're on the subject of Batman organically. Thank you. Can we just take a second?

378
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
second to talk about Pennyworth

379
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:49,380
Because I kind of lost it a little bit today. Everyone knows that that there's a network called epics

380
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,080
Yeah EPIX that made a show called Pennyworth. Yeah, that is the

381
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,940
Subtitle if I'm not mistaken. No, no, don't say okay. Don't say it yet. Okay, because that subtitle is new

382
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:09,640
Newly introduced. I just want to say I don't know about this channel show or subtitle. Okay, this is so good

383
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,200
Pennyworth is a series about Alfred, right?

384
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,040
Batman's butler. It figured that out. Yeah, it is now in it

385
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:26,360
I thought this thing had been I thought it got a season and then everyone was like what happened an origin story for Alfred?

386
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,600
Today I see ads for they're on season 3 HBO Max exclusive

387
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,000
But in season 3 in season 3, there's a new subtitle and it is

388
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,220
The origin of Batman's butler

389
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,520
Now this is interesting for a couple of reasons one

390
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,020
Pennyworth is the rare show that's probably better the less, you know about it

391
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,040
Yeah, probably once you start thinking about they did a show about Batman's butler

392
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,400
It starts to feel kind of bad to watch but now the fact that they're like we got to get more people in

393
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,640
Maybe now we should reveal that this is actually a story about Batman's butler

394
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,600
Maybe the producers just got sick of answering the question like who? I know it's Batman's butler

395
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm like, you know what? We're just gonna put it right there on the tin. Don't worry about it

396
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,360
So is it like he like learns how to

397
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:25,440
Like make tea and clean up clean up a mess. No, he I think he's maybe like a spy

398
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah, they've done a lot of retconning with Pennyworth

399
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:36,260
and Pennywise in the last couple years, which is like he's a fucking sniper

400
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Deadly cool cool dude. I like I don't want to know if it's good if you watch it

401
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,240
I don't want to know I got lots of things. I'm watching don't defend it cuz I've never seen it

402
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,140
I'm not attacking it. I'm saying conceptually ruinous

403
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,360
I don't know how I kept going now that I've said it though

404
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,920
I would like an Alien vs. Predator Pennyworth be Pennywise if we could just work that out, even if it's just animated

405
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,240
I would love that my butler out for Pennywise. Yeah

406
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,520
God

407
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,000
Has Batman ever fought Pennywise two masters of fear?

408
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm mono a clown Oh just going at it Batman spends a lot of time in the sewer. He's definitely encountered

409
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:25,520
Penny. Yeah, how much you want to bet Batman just like I can't I can't I can't I don't see that

410
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,560
Let's take a look at the power rankings one

411
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,520
Scarecrow is anyways, and he's kicked his ass before so and the other thing is that Pennywise got his ass beat by

412
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,880
I think like four dipshit kids. Yeah who then grew up to be

413
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,080
Kind of dipshit adults and they killed him again. So it's like and none of them were let me check spoilers

414
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,800
None of them were Batman. One of them was Bill Hader. So like, you know great love Bill Hader, but not Batman. Yeah

415
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,520
Okay, so Justin here has a oh, okay. This is helpful

416
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,200
Let's see, this is this is a Quora article juice you found it. Yeah, it's just called

417
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,320
How would the battle go between Pennywise Batman? There you go, and there is no further

418
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,080
clarification

419
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,280
Is just like what's up? Yeah, so and then there's just like they agree with me. They fucks up scarecrow

420
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,900
He's now people he is scarier than Pennywise to a lot of people

421
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,640
So it's like it let by the way, the article does in fact verbatim say here is Batman fucking up scarecrow

422
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,520
Yeah, but I would I would argue that there is a fundamental this article begins with answer one

423
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,120
But let me ask you something

424
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,880
It says in an answer tricky. Is there anything that the vigilante of Gotham the Dark Knight is scared of?

425
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,600
No, but yes, right like yeah, we routinely see Batman fucked up man

426
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,160
He's afraid of shit does do all core articles have so many fucking kick-ass

427
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Bitchin pictures of Batman in them

428
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,900
Bitchin pictures of Batman in it guys. The first question asker has written how the fight would go

429
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Yeah, if I may

430
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
Yes

431
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,820
Gotham's

432
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:15,740
Location Gotham City Pennywise confronted a homeless kid and said do you want a balloon little boy the boy?

433
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,860
Seeing Pennywise's wicked smile started to cry and run away

434
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,460
Pennywise then transformed into a bizarre monster laughed in a scary voice and chased the kid to a small and dark

435
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:31,260
It's written in past tense. Yeah, and it's written in between some of the most

436
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,900
Fucking radical bitchin bad bad-ass Batman pics

437
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:43,420
I'm a kid thought he would be done for until a shadow of bat suddenly appeared a bass-shaped logo showed on the dark clouds

438
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,340
He was standing there on the roof of a house the Dark Knight showed up

439
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,340
Penny raw to Pennywise started roaring angrily. He tried to attack the Cape Crusader, but Batman dodged it all

440
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,100
Yes, get a crazy clown then received some big sucker punches from Batman. Just like this monster, right?

441
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,660
There's some cool pictures of Batman beating the ass of some unknown beast killer croc

442
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,220
I would guess maybe killer croc

443
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:20,020
It's not Pennywise like I think logic would dictate by the transitive property if Batman could beat this monster's ass

444
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,820
Pennywise would be dirt in the ground. Yeah

445
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Taking too much damages

446
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Pennywise ground angrily why?

447
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,180
Why can't I sense your fear? Did you sound like Batman for Pennywise? I guess they do

448
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,220
I'm just trying to just do my villain voice. I'll take all of you

449
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,580
I'll feast on your flesh as I feed on your fear not stopping Batman to get some

450
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,340
Next picture Pennywise. Yeah, Pennywise turned into this mushy potato

451
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,300
And begged Batman to spare him

452
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:00,540
There's a picture of Pennywise as a mushy potato and then the next picture is Batman and over it in what I think maybe

453
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,260
Joker font it says what's wrong scared?

454
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,100
And then it says Batman said this in a cold voice so Griffin if you could again in a cold voice

455
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Oh

456
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Then he finished the clown oh

457
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:27,300
My god guys, yeah, there's a picture of Batman walking away from what an explosion an explosion that is

458
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,500
Right next to this in a box labeled related questions are

459
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,340
How would an encounter between the Joker and Pennywise play out? How would Batman defeat Pennywise?

460
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,900
What if the Joker met Pennywise who would win a fight Pennywise of the Joker who would win Pennywise parentheses it versus Deadpool?

461
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:53,440
What would happen if Superman met Pennywise not fought, but if Superman I guess ran into Pennywise at the supermarket

462
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,820
Yeah

463
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,940
I'll tell you who wins between Pennywise and Deadpool and that's me at the theater with my kids

464
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Having the time of my life laughing

465
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,300
Loving learning Darth Vader versus Pennywise. That seems pretty straightforward as well. I don't know

466
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,420
This is fun. This is I wish we did a show that was just like fights. You know what I mean?

467
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
It'd be better. It would be better

468
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,820
It's just like people fighting. Yeah, sure tell him who's winning it. Hey, let's take a quick break

469
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,820
And then we'll come back with a lot more show

470
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,980
The party's just getting started right after this

471
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,180
Now listen, I know we're all pretty hyped up right now thinking about Batman beating the ass to this horrible clown

472
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,240
That scared my kids so fucking much and I would love it if this happened

473
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:51,140
But we need to bring it down a little bit because this is a ad for calm and I'm I'm not there

474
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,700
Like I'm not in the right headspace for it. So if we could work through it together

475
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
Maybe let's do a simple breathing exercise

476
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,360
Let's breathe in through our noses and hold it for about five seconds and exhale through the mouth

477
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,900
Yeah, try not to think about all the Pennywise's you saw while trick-or-treating and you weren't sure if any of them was the real Pennywise

478
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,980
Enjoying his time on the upside. Yeah, damn it Travis

Boys before we continue the rest of the episode, you know

536
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,400
We're talking we've hit on a big question here and I know an expert about this kind of thing that I want to

537
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,640
Read the question. No, no, this isn't this is a question

538
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,360
We discussed before the break and we're just gonna touch on that and then if we have other things to ask me well

539
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:05,440
But first, let me call Griffin Newman. Let me see. I didn't know you had a phone. I thought Justin was the only one with a phone. Hi, is this Griffin Newman?

540
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,760
Hi, yes. Yes. Hi. Who is it? Hi. It's a Travis McElroy your favorite brother from the my brother my brother me

541
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,080
Oh the my yeah. Yeah. No my number one in the ranking

542
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:21,520
I think of you as as the my brother the first my brother title Wow. I'm so glad. Oh, wait a second

543
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,040
Who's someone else on the line? Oh, yeah. Sorry. I had speaker speaker. Yeah, I believe Justin and Griffin in too. Sorry about that

544
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,120
Oh, um, basically we were discussing before the break

545
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:37,160
What would happen if Batman fought Pennywise and then become a much bigger question about the way the Joker met

546
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,720
Pennywise and scarecrow met Pennywise and then I started talking about Pennyworth Griffin

547
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,160
How much do you think about Pennyworth the fact you're talking about Pennyworth origins of Batman's butler? Yes

548
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,360
Yes, I look I think about it a fair amount I think about a fair amount

549
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:01,640
I think a thing that is under discussed with Pennyworth the origins of Batman's butler is that show existed for two full season?

550
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,860
Yes, yeah on a channel. No one watches just called Pennyworth. Yes, and then they decided for season three

551
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
We're gonna put it on HBO Max

552
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,600
Right treat it like this is new

553
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,740
Can I go like I guess the problem the reason people didn't like this is because the title lacked context

554
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,200
We were killing it in every other regard

555
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,920
Well, I know that that is the tradition that has been established with the epics to HBO max pipeline

556
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,480
That was a cleanest pipelines in America

557
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,760
I guess I guess I want to know as somebody who did a guest spot on a series that was

558
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,040
Pulled from HBO max so they didn't have to pay me residuals

559
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,120
How many me how many me's could you have paid by just not doing more?

560
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,400
Why not like leave infinity trade and then just not do anymore I

561
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,280
Refuse to believe anyone watches it refuse. I oh, of course

562
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,800
I was on every episode of vinyl the HBO series, which also has got

563
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,080
I I think I was on maybe nine out of ten

564
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,440
I believe I mean most of my I stood in the background and smoked a cigarette and they went sorry

565
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,080
We couldn't find anything for you in this one. Yeah, it was cool

566
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,000
That would be great. You weren't hired on this show. Why do you keep showing up? You're on nine out of ten

567
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,320
Maybe all vinyls. Yeah, and and it's it's one of those things

568
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,240
That was one of the first shows that got zazz laughed in this recent culling

569
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,880
Yeah of this show is not worth the money. It takes to print the residual checks for five pennies

570
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,360
You do the math on it and you're like, it's not that you're losing money by paying me residuals

571
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,040
You're basically saying it cost too much money to hire someone to calculate how many pennies you're paying me

572
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:55,240
And then the paper itself costs more they're calculating your penny worth basically. Yeah, oh my god this that was in

573
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:02,160
Fantastic. I actually did want to ask you about something griff while we got you on here, please. Yeah, let's and let's just for clarification

574
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,920
griff to so that

575
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,800
Yeah, yeah, well they don't call him to I'm not the first Griffin Newman

576
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,600
He's not Tuman so okay, you don't know you know what no for the sake of this episode Griffin if you're comfortable with this

577
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:22,080
How about your Griffin woman and I'm Griffin Tuman just so there's a kind of consistency. Yeah, I like that

578
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,280
Okay, and we should establish you're in disenchanted and that's like the whole reason disenchanted

579
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,600
Disney-plus original film premiering November 18th. I'm the voice of a talking chipmunk. That's good. That's good. That's good

580
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,780
Let's let's soak that in for a second. Yes tip. It's good. It's good that he's casting that I'm very I hear

581
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:45,040
There's a rumor according to IMDB. There's a rumor that I'll okay plays a scroll. Don't give me any dirt

582
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,120
I want to go in line. Okay, when I want to say Griffin when the movie was announced

583
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,000
I saw you tweeted a picture of Pip and you I believe captured it me

584
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,020
I did not originally assume that meant you had been casting that role

585
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,640
Yeah, you just like identified very closely with the energy of Pip the chipmunk

586
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,760
No, which I do I mean cuz it's a thought it was a photo from the first movie where he's standing in front of a plate

587
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,520
of

588
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,560
Pastrami at Katz's deli with his arms spread out. I want to know what happened to the last guy that played

589
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,800
Pip it's probably canceled. No, you know these days. Are you so hard the real?

590
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:29,760
I'll give you some dirt. It's not it's not very salacious. But in the first movie, so if for those who haven't said enchanted is

591
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,260
Like a fish out of water movie

592
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,760
Yeah

593
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,080
Amy Adams plays princess Giselle and she exists in a cartoon hand-drawn Disney fairy tale princess, you know

594
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,560
It's amazing

595
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,040
It's a great and she falls through a portal and ends up in real New York

596
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,160
And then the whole thing is here's what if a Disney princess had to exist in the real world in New York at the beginning

597
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,580
Of the movie in the hand-drawn sort of musical II section

598
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,760
She's got a bunch of little animal friends like Snow White just Sleeping Beauty her whole

599
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,280
Quarter of animal friends and Pip is her little chipmunk friend. Who's yeah, why it's cracking New York accent

600
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,960
How are you talking about here kind of thing? He's got like three or four lines. Are we talking to Pip now? Yes

601
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,880
Pip can join the call if

602
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,680
Pip is officially disconnected from the call

603
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,560
but so he only has like three or four lines and then the bit is that when he

604
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,720
Falls through the portal and goes into the real world. He is now bound to the the rules of the real world

605
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,080
He can't talk

606
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,960
Okay. Okay. So for most of the movie Pip is mute. There's a great voice actor

607
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,200
He squeaks. He squeaks. Okay, wait, so this is the thing

608
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,480
So the director of the first movie Kevin Lima did all the squeaking

609
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:51,580
And then a great voice over actor named Jeff Bennett did the voice for the couple of lines at the beginning of the movie

610
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,160
It's only at the beginning he did like Johnny Bravo

611
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,320
He's like one of the best voice actors in the world, but there was this weird thing

612
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,760
So it's streaming they can't afford him get Griffin. Yeah, yeah

613
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,760
I mean, I think you're jumping at the end of the story here. But yeah

614
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,020
Two guys have played Pip there wasn't a clear chain of command. There's a different director on this movie. It's been 15 years

615
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,480
I truly the way I got the part was I was asked as a favor to fill in at

616
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:27,280
the table read when they were hoping to find a famous person to do it and

617
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,960
Then they did sort of called me a week later and went like

618
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,560
What did you have it? Did you how did you psych yourself up with like Griffin if you nail this?

619
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:44,520
You're going home with this part. Did you did you walk yourself through that or is it just like just always putting it out?

620
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,140
They're 24-7. It doesn't matter. You only know how to bring your a game. That's all you have only buckets

621
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,940
Well, I try I try to I try to get buckets whenever I can it's a little a little we're being speaking honestly here

622
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,220
It was a little column a little column B, right? I

623
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,560
I I get this phone call from my friend who's the

624
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,060
producer on the movie and he was the producer on the tick as well and

625
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,340
He goes like you'd be doing me a really big favor if you could jump on this zoom and do this table read and basically

626
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,340
Said to me there. There's no job here

627
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,500
There's no job. That's what they want. They want they want to see if you'll still bring the buckets

628
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,340
That's the thing

629
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,940
It was sort of the test and it was like there's no job here

630
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,900
But you'd be on a zoom in front of Disney people and in front of Amy Adams and you know, maybe you know

631
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:36,580
Make a good impression for something else down. You didn't care about Dempsey just Adams like Dempsey. You'll be Dempsey Marsden Menzel

632
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,700
From the Oscar Nunez. Yes

633
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,980
So that was how it was maybe Alan Tudyk

634
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:51,020
I don't want to know you don't Tudyk wasn't was not yet, which was exciting when he came on later, but um, no spoilers

635
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:57,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have no idea to do something. He might be a key grip. We don't know no idea

636
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,380
But so they they say that to me and my calculation in my head juice wasn't

637
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,340
Can I steal this part?

638
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:12,340
I truly the limits of my ability at the moment how far I would allow myself to imagine was if I fucking

639
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,820
nail this read

640
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,660
Maybe they let me be the guy who holds the puppet off-camera for reference. Oh

641
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:26,380
Yeah, truly the sky captain in the world of tomorrow. I was

642
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:33,060
Absolutely. I was like, well this character's animated if they hire a more famous person do the voice

643
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,080
They're not gonna want to be there on set. I can be the reference voice

644
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,040
And I'll hold the puppet and I could be you could be the co Bethany Olsen the third of the Olsen triplets

645
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,740
They only use for two shots from behind. Yeah, that was my whole that was my strategy and this is coming right right out of lockdown

646
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:55,580
I've just gotten vaccinated and I'm like the idea of anyone hiring me to be anywhere is exciting

647
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,180
so I don't need to be in this movie bring me on this set and

648
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,100
And then like yeah, like a week after the thing they called me and they just said like you're you're so cheap

649
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,900
This is so much easier. If we just hire they really say that Griffin to they didn't say that

650
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:17,860
They didn't say that but that was the underlying reality is we could save a lot of money that we can redistribute to the CGI

651
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:25,420
And if we just have you do it, it's yeah, it's hard because they they know like I as people who've been in films

652
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,520
It's hard knowing that you're in that position because we would do anything for free, right? Yes. Yes

653
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:37,660
So anytime we're not in a movie. Yeah, that's someone said that's another person who has voted like to spend money on

654
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,920
Nothing essentially, like I'd rather them not be in the movie for nothing

655
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,940
There's no they would detract every movie that was released without my presence in it

656
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:51,620
Me that the director thought my presence in it would detract from the it was you were not worth zero dollars

657
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,460
They made the decision to invest money

658
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,220
Into having someone who is better at acting and voice acting than any of the three of us

659
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
But Griffin, I would say statistically

660
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:07,800
Insurance Griffin woman there have been plenty of movies that have gone over budget in history, right?

661
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,700
Sure, those over budget movies went over budget instead of having Justin in them. And that's more offensive

662
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,840
It's almost more that they would rather lose money. Yeah

663
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,460
There's I don't want to ask you out something while we gotcha

664
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:28,060
Let's not do the question. We had picked out. I only want to hear Griffin Tuman's thoughts about a Pennywise view Batman

665
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,980
I mean, yeah, let's let's call an audible. Okay, ask you a question about pickles

666
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,260
That was gonna be really irreverent and fun and probably we had a good time with it

667
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:45,260
But I only want to know I only want to talk about Batman V. Pennywise the the incredibly

668
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:53,060
Important Supreme Court case that was foundational for the fate of our country. I mean be Pennywise Dawn of Justice. I

669
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,760
Um, it's interesting. I mean look, first of all, I appreciate you buffering

670
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,620
Give me me some time asking some disenchanted questions so I could really stew on this one

671
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:08,180
November 18th, did you say that November 18th Disney Plus original film streaming everywhere?

672
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,180
Yeah, it was it was hard for me to focus on any of that because I was really well

673
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,300
I know and I I was sort of talking but as I was in my head

674
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,660
I was just doing the math because I worry if I Travis the Travis

675
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,660
Yeah

676
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,700
If I had answered right away

677
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:29,300
I think my answer would have been rash and stupid and yeah, or we thought out and now I've really had some time to sit

678
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,780
on this

679
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,060
We all know that obviously the Joker is

680
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,220
Batman's greatest

681
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
Enemy, right? Yeah

682
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,660
Crime the conference of crime. I mean the things that make us cry make him laugh. Yeah

683
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,820
And and also I mean what the greatest character in American drama

684
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,900
I mean has now become our number one and funniest

685
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,100
Scariest the serious the most serious why so serious?

686
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,700
Yeah

687
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,260
But I think this is that thing with the Joker

688
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,280
There's that balance where you do feel like the guy is trying to entertain you

689
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,860
It's a thing I like about the Joker is that he has bits

690
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:15,340
Even when he's doing violent stuff or mean stuff or dare I say it illegal things. Whoa, right?

691
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:21,100
No, I mean, he's a he does crime guys. Yeah, he does crime under man's laws not gods

692
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,220
But but but he's he's bringing props, right? Got the fish with the lipstick

693
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,100
He's doing turns of phrase all that bang gun right the bank on and he's got a stick

694
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,940
He's got an outfit a persona. Yeah doing a whole thing blow up Maggie Gyllenhaal

695
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,700
Larry has funny funny. I think pennywise

696
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,520
Despite falling into this evil clown trope

697
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:50,240
Yeah, is pennywise ever intentionally trying to be funny?

698
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,800
That's interesting I hadn't even right about that angle and so I'm like I'm trying to do the math in my head and go would

699
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,640
Batman hate Pennywise more or less

700
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,480
Because Pennywise is kind of just straight chaos

701
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,960
Whereas Joker is putting on a show like Batman

702
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,720
It's interesting that you are weighing this in a conversation about who would be whose ass no

703
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,880
I think it's it it is interesting to think about like the sport of

704
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,640
Boxing. Yes is if the if one of the boxers hates the other one much much more

705
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,920
Then it will increase the ferocity of their

706
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,240
Batman doesn't have powers as we know, right? He's got the very rich

707
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,000
Which you know this it makes some very power in our broken society

708
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But but then he also you know, he is driven by this this rage this sense of vengeance

709
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,040
So I'm like, yeah, that's the special move meter, right?

710
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:54,600
Right. I'm just saying I think there's something to the fact that not only is the Joker so twisted but the Joker annoys Batman

711
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Like yes drive him crazy that fills up the special move meter

712
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:05,480
The the bits are also like, you know, they say that the the Joker is like all chaos, right?

713
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,440
Right. It seems like the Joker is working pretty hard pretty hard on this to do his bit

714
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,840
This is the one who's like I'm gonna just punch this gift. What if

715
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:21,480
Batman is so annoyed by the Joker is the Batman does find Joker funny and he's trying so hard to keep a straight face

716
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Right, that's like his whole bit

717
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:31,360
Like you're canonically the the only time he ever ever busted up at the Joker he fucking kills him

718
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:37,880
Yeah, the only time he ever ever in history busts up at the Joker. He's like good one Joker. It made him

719
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:45,480
So fucking angry that the Joker made him laugh. Whereas like Pennywise. I wonder if it's just like well, this is a bad guy

720
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,560
So to a certain degree, it's a little more passionless

721
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,200
It's a little more routine whipping this guy's ass because Pennywise like, you know, it's just hanging out in a fucking sewer grate

722
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:02,560
Going like come here kid. Yeah, which is bad, which is bad, but he's not like juggling. He's not doing like

723
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:09,700
Committing real crimes. I see what you're saying, right? And he's also not leading with I'm pretending like I'm a normal clown

724
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,600
He's kind of upfront just creepy monster in the guise of decrepit clown, you know

725
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:23,200
Right, that's interesting. And I wonder if that pisses Batman off less and for that reason it's more just a routine ass-whooping

726
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,240
We are assuming yes

727
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,480
Yeah, that joke that Pennywise were he would appear today on the day that Batman lives

728
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,280
That he would be this clown, right? Because I feel like he would definitely come as a fortnight guy

729
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,320
Oh, you know like I think that he could manifest in any shape. Yeah

730
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:49,800
Uh, what I think I manifest is Steve from Minecraft or like a fortnight kind of guy

731
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,400
Interesting or like burger boss from for he'd pick one of the funny ones peel

732
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,080
Yeah, once it busts you up, man. Yeah dead

733
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,300
Right, I think if he does that Batman would beat the shit out of Deadpool Deadpool, right Batman crazy

734
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:12,640
I think if Pennywise is affecting a persona like that if he is coming in as like beef boss

735
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:19,280
Batman will get riled up. Yeah, if if he's just a creepy child abductor

736
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,440
I think Batman's hurts in it a little less, but does he still win though?

737
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,360
Well, here's the wrinkle I want to put in

738
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:34,080
Batman rarely goes up against truly supernatural. Yeah, right

739
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,080
Pennywise has moves

740
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,720
That maybe you're outside of Batman's wheelhouse. I mean clay face

741
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,000
Rajal ghoul clay face is science

742
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,480
Killer croc

743
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:55,480
Croc has a skin mutation. You leave him alone killer cross science. Mr. Freeze science regular just

744
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,080
Yeah, but he's not it take it away from the pit he's just like you or me

745
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,560
Exactly. Listen, if everybody's got pits when we get down to it metaphorically speaking, of course, of course

746
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,240
Do you think Batman ever encounters a villain who's just like a guy robbing a bank and he's like, what's your stick?

747
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,400
He's like, what do you mean? It's like what are you or your robbing man? No, I'm just my name's Doug and I'm robbing this thing

748
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,200
I don't I need money. I have no marketable skills

749
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,600
It's just like a regular crime. This isn't really a Batman thing. I'm gonna go

750
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,880
Why is everybody in Gotham robbing banks at night

751
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:41,040
That's a gentleman gentleman ghost is a Batman villain and I don't think you guys could okay convince me that that's not

752
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,920
Shade

753
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,520
That that is a good pull

754
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:51,220
I and I for the listener at home you did just spend a minute locking in on clearly an extensive Google search

755
01:02:51,220 --> 01:03:00,500
Okay, I Google supernatural Batman villains the number one one is fucking Raj Al Ghul cuz he can do magic and is

756
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,820
immortal and shit

757
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,180
Gets away from Batman or yeah, sometimes via death

758
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:15,360
This is a good point. Raj Al Ghul is one of the slipperiest Batman foes Batman rarely gets the better of him

759
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:21,100
I think the super and gentlemen ghost it's like I don't I think I think it's a bad

760
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:27,220
Day for Batman when gentlemen ghost shows up. Oh, yeah, he's like I know what to do with this guy. I know his moves, right?

761
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,580
gentlemen ghosts slippery and I wonder even just like I don't think Pennywise is

762
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,980
Stronger than Batman, but I think if Pennywise starts doing that fucking dance

763
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,740
Batman just might be thrown off his axis. Yeah. Oh and by the way, we are I think all in our minds imagining bills guard guard

764
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,260
Yeah, of course

765
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,260
It I don't know that we are

766
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:53,220
imagining Tim Curry I'd not like, you know, obviously iconic Tim creep any wise like

767
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,900
Incredible not the physicality isn't there and it's so much for me

768
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,220
with curry you're saying Korean and

769
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,740
His is more of a cerebral tear. Yes

770
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,580
Guard. Yes, when Bill Skarsgard does he's like

771
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:13,860
And starts like, you know flossing and doing orange orange

772
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,340
We gotta start recording guys. Seriously, we're gonna run out of time

773
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,740
Griffin welcome to show Griffin Newman. Sorry, we don't more time to chat real quick

774
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:28,140
Got a rush on through November 18th disenchanted. Yes

775
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:33,640
Pip the chipmunk now talks the entire film through now or chipmunk

776
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,260
More chipmunk. Yeah. Yeah

777
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:43,740

778
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,260
Just do good job in the script the first time and I got the one the one I'm proud of

779
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,540
I think I got a sciatica joke in there

780
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,460
Any deez nuts

781
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,580
Come on to I

782
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:05,780
Tried. All right, maybe can you record? Oh, can you record a few as pip deez nuts jokes?

783
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,780
That then our fans can

784
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:13,540
Cut in and like uses tick-tocks that'll go like super viral if you just give us

785
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,580
Okay, so just I just want to contextualize this before I do for us

786
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,140
Yeah, yeah, and the count the context will be in it every time we play of course

787
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,660
You cannot you cannot divorce the context from this

788
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,680
So that just you know to the many Disney executives listening to this episode right now

789
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:36,040
Of course when I'm about to talk about deez nuts the nuts I'm speaking of are the nuts that pip the chipmunk

790
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:42,200
Burrows and stores and yes, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. You cannot interpret this any other way. No
