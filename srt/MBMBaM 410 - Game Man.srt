1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm your middle brother, Travis Mario McElroy.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Crash Griffin McElroy Bandicoot.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,480
It's time to power up!

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
That's the stinger that I produced.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah, do you want to hear it again?

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
Yeah, click play on it because I know you pre-recorded it and play it again.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
It's time to power up!

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
That was really good, Justin.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Yeah, we're getting pumped for the triple, Electronic 3. We are psyched out of our minds,

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
not going. So stoked for it this time.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Well, you can take the boy out of the games industry,

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,080
but you can't take the games out of the boy because I swallowed like

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,800
14 Nintendo DS cartridges back in 2009 and hadn't seen them yet.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,600
I swallowed a lot of those Switch cartridges. They tasted bad, but I couldn't help it.

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah, you get them down fast enough you don't get the taste in your mouth. Nice try though, Reggie.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
Can I tell you guys what I'm really excited about at E3?

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah, I know what it is.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Justin has reminded me of it, or I saw it was Griffin.

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,240
I can't wait for that new Crash Bandicoot game starring Randy Bandicoot.

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,920
Yeah, we all love Randy Bandicoot. He's the nasty Crash Bandicoot who cusses and-

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,280
Finally an NC-17 Crash Bandicoot game.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
And with Randy, you get all the jeans. He doesn't cut them off at the calf.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
He goes full ankle jeans and he cusses and has a gun. So we're all-

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm looking forward to that.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
We all love Randy Coot.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm going to say this, but I'm not sure that I'm correct.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
I believe Randy Bandicoot is owned by Nintendo,

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
so that's probably going to be the big Nintendo installation this year.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
I think 2016, it was Zelda.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,440
2017, it was Mario. 2018, Randy Bandicoot.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
Randy Bandicoot, love it.

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
There's a new Mario everybody's looking forward to.

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
This time it's sort of more serious.

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
And he's older in this one. He's like 70.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
So old Mario's coming out.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
And then this one, I think he's got a grandson.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
And he's teaching his grandson about how toxic masculinity is bad.

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,720
And he's like, you use your rage to fight, but you use your heart to temper it.

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
What are you looking forward to, Justin?

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,680
The Master Chef, that's right, Gordon Ramsay, is back in Halo.

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
And it's just called that.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, sure.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,080
And that's all we know so far.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
But we can speculate about what's going to happen in the game.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah, it's almost like the developers of Halo panicked

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
because they couldn't think of a funny joke fast enough.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,840
And so they just sort of said the first thing that came to their mind.

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,880
Now, why would they be trying to come up with a joke, Griffin?

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,000
That doesn't make sense.

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
PlayStation 5.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Oh, okay.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
I've been out of the loop a little bit.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,880
Is PlayStation 5 going to be a sort of going concern at the big day?

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm looking forward to Xbox XXD.

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm looking forward to Ubisoft press conference.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,520
Tony Hawk is supposed to come out and just apologize to everyone.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,040
And that's something I've been looking for.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I mean, I need that to move on.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,960
Now, Griffin, you said you were worried about excluding people.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,040
So if you don't follow video games very closely, you may not have gotten that.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
So I was hoping you could take a few minutes

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
to just explain why that last joke was funny.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,480
Sure.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,000
So here's what happened.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,640
Nintendo press conference 2013.

72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Nintendo came out and they're like, here's our new system.

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Everybody's going to love it.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
It's got it all.

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Mario, Zelda, the Eternal Darkness 2,

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,680
all the games you've been looking forward to.

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
And this is just the prototype is the only one that we've got,

78
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
but it does a billion pixel graphics and is free.

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
And everybody's, and Tony Hawk doing his dumb shit,

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,280
kickflips up onto the stage, knocks it over and breaks it.

81
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,720
So none of us got it.

82
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
And instead we got the Wii U, a real bastard of a video game product.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
And so he's felt really bad about that for a long time.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
I will also say, so as not to exclude people,

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
if you are going to E3 and you don't care about video games,

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
um, please, please, please, please get some chicken tenders.

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Got you.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Let me know how they are.

89
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Because I'm not going to be able to make it this year.

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,680
And chicken tenders are my favorite part of E3.

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
So if anybody's going to be there,

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,120
feel free to tweet pictures to me of your chicken tenders.

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Get them.

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Let me know how they are.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,560
If you see Big the cat,

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,240
please ask him to be a guest on my brother, my brother and me.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,880
Got you.

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
We would love to have him.

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Never had a cat.

100
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm excited for, uh, I think I heard some scuttlebutt this year.

101
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Nintendo's got a big announcement.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,640
They're finally ready to release the Game Man.

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
He's all grown up and he's ready to fuck.

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
Tetris, I mean.

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
That's right.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Fuck Tetris is the first game announced for the Game Man.

108
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,240
It takes eight very horny AAA batteries.

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Very sexual flesh colored AAA batteries.

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
It takes 16 of them.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,320
Every time you clear a line and you slot that last little, uh,

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,760
tetromino into the hole in such a pleasing way,

113
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,840
there's just a dude and he comes in through the bad Game Man speakers

114
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,640
and it's just like,

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,160
Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
So don't play this one at church, kids.

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Wait, Scott, you like-

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,720
Did you like when the Game Boy was black and white?

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, this-

120
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,920
The Game Man's got a new color and it's jizz.

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Oh, no.

122
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh, now that word's just there, Justin.

123
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,680
Oh, no.

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
I didn't say it.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Shigeru Miyamoto said it in his original design document for the Game Man,

126
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,800
recently unearthed by the Library of Congress

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,040
and some rogue game developers just made the Game Man

128
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,520
without Nintendo's express written permission.

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
It's a hub-licensed sequel.

130
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
This is the problem I have with the Game Man,

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,880
is that I don't mind all the updates they've made to the graphics cards

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
and the sound cards and all the new game.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
That's all great.

134
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,560
Why did they have to give the Game Man realistic muscly arms?

135
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
I find it off-putting and they're fully artic-

136
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
Like they move on their own.

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,000
I do not care for it.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,600
I got knuckle tattoos that say ready to jerk it

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,520
and they gave it extra fingers

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
so it would have room for all those letters.

141
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,560
I got home from work the other day

142
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,240
and my Game Man that Nintendo sent me early, I came home.

143
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
He was just grilling up some steaks out on the back porch

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,920
and I was like, that's not safe.

145
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,240
And he said, he said, cram it.

146
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
Oh, no.

147
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
And he kicked my ass.

148
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,480
Yeah.

149
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Oh, no Griffin.

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,560
I said, I said, Game Man, what kind of beer do you want?

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
And he said, bad.

152
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
And I said, can you be more specific?

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
He wants a bad beer?

154
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
He said, here.

155
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
So that's all he cared about.

156
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
He doesn't have a palette for a great beer.

157
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
He just wants to guzzle down whatever's around.

158
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
He made me do 60 pushups in front of my wife, the Game Man.

159
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't care for it.

160
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,760
You know, I'm willing to review it now.

161
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,560
I'll say, listen, maybe they'll do some updates

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,480
that will make him not so angry

163
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,320
and I do look forward to that.

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,440
But like, come on Nintendo.

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,920
He pushed me into an umbrella stand

166
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,840
and said he fixed my car.

167
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,120
But here's the thing, guys.

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,480
It wasn't broken.

169
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,680
And I would say on a stack of Bibles, it wasn't broken.

170
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
So I don't know what exactly he did.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Now I will say this about the Game Man,

172
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,880
is that I will love this 40 pound mobile game console

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,800
that kicks my ass and makes me do pushups

174
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,840
in front of my wife if they just put Animal Crossing on it.

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
I'll do that for you.

176
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,080
It's the thing about the Game Man

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
is he doesn't have a screen.

178
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
So he's just telling you what your character is doing

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
in Animal Crossing.

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,840
And you can make requests.

181
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,160
You know, it almost seems like Nintendo

182
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
has just hired a fleet of men

183
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
to come to my house and yell at me.

184
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
And they don't come with games

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,840
and they seem to just be human men

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,960
who Nintendo has sent to bully me.

187
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't understand this.

188
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
What is this business plan, Nintendo?

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Oh, I wish I could tell you, Chad, but I was left in disgrace

190
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
from the games industry, so.

191
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,760
You know what's so powerful about my brother,

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
my brother and me?

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,000
We can all agree that the Game Man segment

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
was excellent and good.

195
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
And in a traditional writer's room,

196
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
what they would probably do is say,

197
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
what's funny about E3, keep throwing things out,

198
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
and then eventually hit upon the Game Man

199
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
and then put that into the show that they're doing.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
But what's so powerful about my brother,

201
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
my brother and me is we're gonna use all of it.

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,040
We're gonna harness all the things we said before

203
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,360
when we were trying to find something funny

204
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
and that will still be there for you.

205
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
You could see the roadmap, you know,

206
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,600
because you see some of this stuff on TV

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
and you think, how are they coming up with it?

208
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
And on my brother, my brother and me,

209
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
we have the courage to say, here's how.

210
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
Guessing until we get lucky.

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
Just kind of closing our eyes and spinning around a lot

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
and pointing at something.

213
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah.

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
Knocking down all the vases in the room

215
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
until we find one that's full of rubber chickens.

216
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,760
Yeah.

217
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
How about a regular question, though?

218
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
How do I convince my boyfriend to wear shorts more often?

219
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
He's got the legs and ass of a Greek god

220
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
and the world needs to know.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,520
He's not self-conscious about his body.

222
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
He just likes blue jeans.

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
And that's from Gam Loving Girlfriend.

224
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,880
What a frustration to keep those beautiful pipes

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
under denim wrap.

226
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Yeah, if only there was some way

227
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,680
that you could wear jeans and shorts at the same time.

228
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
No, it's not that, Trav.

229
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
You don't understand.

230
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
Sometimes, I'm at home right now.

231
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
I've been working from home all day.

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
I could have changed into shorts at any point,

233
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
but I'm wearing these denim boots because it's for me.

234
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
Now, there is another compromise here

235
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
and that's that you gotta get those,

236
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,560
that George Michael jeans

237
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,080
where it's just you can see it,

238
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,480
all the definition of each nut.

239
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
It's just right there for you.

240
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
The world is yours.

241
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Do you mean, Girlfriend,

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
because the jeans be so tight

243
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,200
or because they be so ripped up?

244
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
I think both is good.

245
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,920
I think if you can get the rips mostly in the calf zone

246
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,880
so that people can see a neat striation effect

247
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,440
as if to show how old your jeans are,

248
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,400
that can be really good.

249
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
But otherwise, you just want these puppies

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,040
as tight as possible.

251
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,000
Gripping, gripping, always gripping.

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
Well, you can also get some sliced up jeans

253
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
in the butt region.

254
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
So it's like, oh, is there a butt in there?

255
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,800
Yes, there is.

256
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,680
There is.

257
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
That's confirmed.

258
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,760
You know, maybe he's just trying to break in

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,720
a new pair of shrink-to-fits

260
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
and you gotta wear those.

261
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,840
Jesse Thorn says you have to wear them for 17 years.

262
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,280
You put your baby in a pair of tiny shrink-to-fit jeans

263
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,960
and then you don't let them escape

264
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,880
until they graduate high school and that's true

265
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
because they grow with you.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
They form to your body.

267
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
Jesse Thorn says that?

268
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
That's what Jesse Thorn says.

269
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
Jesse Thorn says that on the graduation day

270
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,160
that they can emerge from their old dirty jeans

271
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
like a chrysalis, but until then,

272
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,960
they must grow in the same pair of jeans,

273
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
same pair of shrink-to-fits.

274
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,160
So if your boyfriend is breaking in

275
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
a pair of shrink-to-fits,

276
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,120
that is an investment that you may not appreciate now,

277
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
but much like the hen saving corn

278
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,720
as the grasshopper played in the field,

279
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
once the fall comes around,

280
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,040
you'll be so excited about these great jeans

281
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
and the investment that he put into them.

282
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
So at the end of that parable, Justin,

283
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
is the grasshopper come around like,

284
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,840
hey, I wanna eat some corn?

285
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm a grasshopper?

286
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,240
Hey, I know I'm the world's first corn-eating grasshopper,

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
so really the world shouldn't be surprised

288
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,880
that I didn't save any corn because who knew?

289
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,960
But I saw your corn and I was like,

290
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,920
fuck, that looks good.

291
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
I know it's about a hen.

292
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
There's a hen in there somewhere.

293
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
There's a hen in there somewhere.

294
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,960
She asks a bunch of things to help her plant the corn

295
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
and they say, maybe it's just a bunch of different animals,

296
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
none of which are grasshoppers.

297
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,200
That's possible.

298
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.

299
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
And all of them are wearing some really tight, sexy-ass jeans.

300
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
Yeah, for sure.

301
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
How about a yahoo?

302
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,080
Yeah.

303
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,000
This one was sent in by Fizz.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,880
Thanks, Fizz.

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,640
It's anonymous yahoo answers user, so I'ma calm.

306
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,400
I think this is the Papa John guy

307
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
and this advertisement says,

308
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,320
no, it's the coach of some sort of sports team,

309
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,960
but he sure as hell looks like the Papa John's man anyway.

310
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Papa John asks,

311
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
can the Cavs theoretically sign me to a 15-day contract

312
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,840
if I could win them the championship against Golden State?

313
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
How much maximum would I be able to earn in 15 days

314
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,640
if I can win the title for the Cavs with my sidekick, LeBron?

315
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
This is an interesting question.

316
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
I don't know anything about basketball contracts

317
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
or the sport at large,

318
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
but would it be possible if I put up my highlight reel

319
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,840
of dunking in six threes

320
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,000
and then somebody at the Cleveland Cavaliers sees it

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,280
and says, these are two factors,

322
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,720
these are two things that we are deficient in

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
is dunks and threes

324
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,760
and then sign me for two weeks and change

325
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
to get in there just as long as they're playing

326
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,720
the Golden State Warriors and I can get in there and win

327
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
and then the contract's over and I'm free.

328
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Well, Griffin, I think so because I remember not too long ago,

329
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
I think it was about two months ago,

330
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,800
when you injured your knees in that freak accident

331
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
and then they healed in such a way

332
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,320
that you could dunk like a dunking machine.

333
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,040
Yeah.

334
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
And so I could see that happening as like,

335
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,040
maybe just one day you're at a Cavs game

336
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,280
and somebody drops their popcorn,

337
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,080
but whoa, you jump and you grab it

338
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,040
and they're like, who was that?

339
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
Yeah, because my flubber knees,

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
and thank you for bringing that up, Trav,

341
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
but definitely haven't brought that up before

342
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
because I wasn't trying to keep it private or anything,

343
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
but yeah, I guess let's talk about it.

344
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah, I got hit by two different cars at the same time.

345
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,160
You had one for each knee.

346
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
So thanks, Trav.

347
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,640
Well, edit it back so it sounds like

348
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm talking about someone else.

349
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,880
Probably wondering how that happened.

350
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
It was during a drag race, of course.

351
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
Thank you, Travis.

352
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm sorry, Griffin.

353
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,680
Travis was alluding to the hit teen comedy

354
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,640
Rookie of the Year.

355
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,600
Oh, was I?

356
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,560
Funky but loving.

357
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,200
When he injured, the kid injures his arm in such a way

358
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,880
that makes him great at pitching.

359
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,760
That's, of course, possible and ludicrous at the same time,

360
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,480
but they never explore the extension of that reality

361
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,240
in that fiction that I want to see the pro baseball players

362
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
lining up to attempt to give themselves the same injury

363
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
that this child withstood.

364
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,480
Yeah.

365
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,960
Like purposely going into the doctor

366
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,120
and having them jam various shivs and what have you

367
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
into their musculature to try to reenact

368
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
this terrible accident.

369
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
That would be ghoulish, but I think

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
it'd be worth it for the Blu-ray.

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
Also, could we just for a little bit,

372
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
I would like one scene edited in for the 25th anniversary

373
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Blu-ray edition of Rookie of the Year

374
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
that's just Major League Baseball's lawyers being like,

375
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,560
well, this child is 15, so we probably can't let him

376
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,760
legally work for us, right?

377
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,160
There's laws against this, is there not?

378
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I want the scene where the kid's arm heals

379
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,160
and he's like, oh, man, I really liked

380
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,520
having that cool pitching arm.

381
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,040
I wonder what other parts of my body

382
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
I can sort of modify like that.

383
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
And he just whams himself right in the goners

384
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
with a big meat tenderizer, just thinking like,

385
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,960
maybe more powerful balls, I guess.

386
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
No, that one didn't work.

387
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey, mom, hospital again.

388
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Hospital, call an Uber.

389
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
What do you think Rowan Gardner goes on?

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah, what's up?

391
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,920
That was a deep pull.

392
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,720
Goes on to like, what's he do?

393
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,240
After he lands again, he does an underhanded pitch

394
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,320
in the MLB and he wins the big game.

395
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Spoiler alert for Rookie of the Year.

396
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,480
What does he do with the rest of his life?

397
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
Let's write some fan fiction.

398
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,240
Probably tours around malls, right?

399
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
He signs things in malls.

400
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
Noah goes from school to school showing kids

401
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,960
that drugs are bad by throwing a baseball weird and fast.

402
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Yeah, drugs are bad, but it's okay to like,

403
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
injure yourself to be better at sports.

404
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,480
Oh, I have breaking news.

405
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
The film of Rookie of the Year is based on

406
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,960
a 1954 American comedy, the name of which is Ruggies Bump.

407
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
What?

408
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Sorry, Justin, neither of the words you just said were words.

409
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
Can you take another swing at it?

410
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
Ruggies Bump.

411
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,040
It still sounds like you're saying Rookie.

412
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,880
Like noogie, but with an R?

413
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
My friends, the film is called Ruggies Bump.

414
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
Ruggies Bump.

415
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
According to the poster, Rookie is the miracle kid

416
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
with the super zoom ball.

417
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
And the name of the film is Ruggies Bump.

418
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
It is Rookie.

419
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,600
It's Rookie.

420
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
Rookie, not rookie.

421
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
Rookie.

422
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,120
And I don't know why.

423
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,160
And this is the kid with the super zoom ball, right?

424
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,240
This is the one with the super zoom ball.

425
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,760
They call him Rookie.

426
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
On the poster, does it say written by cocaine?

427
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Plot is a young boy who loves baseball develops a strange bump on his arm.

428
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,160
Wait.

429
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,320
Rookie.

430
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,680
Rookie's got a strange bump on his arm and it gives him the super zoom ball.

431
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,640
The bump has such an effect on his pitching arm

432
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
that he soon finds himself playing for a major league baseball team.

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,120
As stupid as the he fell and broke his arm

434
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
and the tendons rehealed too tight is,

435
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,760
it's got to be better than my tumor that makes me good at pitching.

436
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
A strange bump.

437
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
My strange bump.

438
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,080
One question.

439
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
Rookie's bump, I call it.

440
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
That's right, Rookie.

441
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh my God, it's talking.

442
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
That was my question.

443
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,480
It definitely talks, right?

444
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
And was voiced by like Jimmy Stewart or something.

445
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Had to talk.

446
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm looking at one of the variations of the poster for it

447
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,880
and it's Rookie's bump featuring the Brooklyn Dodgers.

448
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
So that's a pretty cool year for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

449
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,920
And a good year for the movie

450
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,520
when you have to advertise the fact that you tricked a baseball team to being in it.

451
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,440
That was the least we've ever answered a question.

452
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Let's move on.

453
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,520
I can't stop thinking about the phrase Rookie's bump.

454
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
Rookie's bump is my movie.

455
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm sorry, sir, but the outlet doesn't look good.

456
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,880
It seems that you have Rookie's bump.

457
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Not Rugal's bump.

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,040
How long do I have?

459
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,280
Like three weeks, but they're going to be three really fun major league weeks.

460
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,280
I want to do a sequel to Rookie's bump

461
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,800
and it's the same thing, but the kid hates baseball

462
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,840
and he doesn't want to.

463
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
I don't want to do that, doctor.

464
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, could you just cure my strange bump?

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Could you just cure my strange bump?

466
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,080
I could destroy a beautiful bump like that.

467
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
Put my t-shirts fit.

468
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm a junior in college living in a student apartment complex.

469
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
One of my roommates asked me to watch his plants farm

470
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
while he's in Europe for the summer.

471
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
And I said yes.

472
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,160
So now I'm alone in my apartment

473
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
babysitting an ironing board covered in plants.

474
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
My question is this.

475
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,840
My plant owning roommate left a gallon jug of artisanal water

476
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
from some fancy well next to the plants.

477
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
It looks expensive and it's almost empty.

478
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
Do I have to buy more expensive artisanal water?

479
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,840
Can I just water them with tap water?

480
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,920
Will the plants tell on me?

481
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,280
And that's from Confused Plant Sitter in Colorado.

482
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I mean, they'll tell on you by dying

483
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
because they're not getting their special water.

484
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
Their special water.

485
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Their secret stuff.

486
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Their secret plant stuff.

487
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,720
It is Michael Jordan's sweat, definitely.

488
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
That's what they drank in Space Jam, right?

489
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
I haven't seen it in a long time.

490
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,200
When they say Michael's secret stuff,

491
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
they're talking about his-

492
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,360
Michael's piss.

493
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,480
His fluids.

494
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,280
Thank you, Travis.

495
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,080
Thank you.

496
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,240
Yeah, no, Daffy Duck's spraying happily Michael MJ's piss.

497
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
Thank you, Travis, for thinking of Porky Pig

498
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
and all of his friends just spraying MJ's piss

499
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,680
right into the gob to be good at basketball.

500
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you, Travis.

501
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
What's up with that Space Jam 2?

502
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,640
Yeah, come on.

503
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
Where's that?

504
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,600
Water has the following in it.

505
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,480
A little bit of hydrogen, twice as much oxygen,

506
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,840
or perhaps flip that.

507
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
I don't think there's anything else in this stuff, right?

508
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
Like the water, it comes off the most beautiful glacier

509
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
and the stuff that comes out of my street tap

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,360
is just water, right?

511
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
It's the same chemicals.

512
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
So who cares, man?

513
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
Well, the plants care because they need their special-

514
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,040
Yeah.

515
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
Minerals.

516
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,320
Their special minerals.

517
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,160
Special minerals.

518
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
They need their minerals.

519
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
What kinds of things do plants need?

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,360
Let's just go back and forth listing some of the most

521
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
important things that plants need in their water.

522
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,160
Trav?

523
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
Have compassion.

524
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,640
Kisses.

525
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,160
Okay.

526
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
Plants need kisses, he says.

527
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,240
Yeah.

528
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,920
And they need money.

529
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,120
Plants need your money.

530
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
I mean, for me, it's always been water, sunshine,

531
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,280
and for bees to have sex on them.

532
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
Is that what that's about?

533
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Is that why we're so concerned about the bees?

534
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
Yeah, we need them to get nasty in all our beautiful plants

535
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,160
or else all the corn and blueberries are denzo.

536
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,120
I don't understand giving plants more than they need to live.

537
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,160
I don't believe that there are certain waters that's better for plants

538
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,040
because they're getting the dirty water from the sky, right?

539
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,760
Like, many plants are doing just fine with our shitty, dirty water.

540
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

541
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
So why do they need special-

542
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't believe that these plants need special water.

543
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
How do you even know how much?

544
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,200
I bought my wife a plant from Mother's Day and then I hung it outside

545
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,920
and then I gave it various amounts of water,

546
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,400
just hoping that I would stumble on the right combination

547
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,440
that would keep it alive.

548
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,800
I was not successful.

549
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,200
But how do you even know how much water to give the things?

550
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,320
I do also- I love J-Man because I feel the same way

551
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,520
that if I have a plant in my house, it is not about

552
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
I hope I can help this plant flourish,

553
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,080
but rather I just hope I can beat the clock on plant death.

554
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,520
Like, I'm not trying to have the world's best fern.

555
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
I merely want it to last longer than six months

556
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,080
and that's a big old W for me.

557
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
That's why I like pro-flowers.

558
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
That ship has sailed.

559
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
It's not about keep this alive, it's like preserve this corpse.

560
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,160
And be, you know what I mean?

561
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
There's no pressure there.

562
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm a mortuary, not a hospital.

563
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
And also, what do you do if you have to iron clothes?

564
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
Oh my shit, Justin, you're right.

565
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
Yeah, I just didn't even think about that.

566
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,680
Yeah.

567
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
Can't possibly move these precious spoiled plants.

568
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
These pampered plants.

569
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,520
Maybe that's it.

570
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
Maybe you need to toughen these plants up

571
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
and take it on like a survival weekend.

572
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Take the plants on a road trip.

573
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,160
You and your friend, Jack Black,

574
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,840
in the front seat, these plants in the back seat.

575
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,240
A wild sort of road trip.

576
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Yeah, you're trying to keep these plants alive,

577
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,680
but have they ever really lived?

578
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah, they're gonna be uncomfortable about it at first.

579
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,840
They're gonna be like, ugh, are you sure about this?

580
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
And then some bees are gonna start having sex on them

581
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
and they're like, well, this is how it's supposed to be.

582
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
And then it turns out, oh no, it's weed

583
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
and you've been pulled over.

584
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh shit.

585
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,800
Oh, has it been weed the whole time?

586
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,080
I think it's been, oh no, it's been weed the whole time.

587
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
Have the plants been weed the whole time?

588
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
Because your friend is no friend of yours.

589
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
It's a friend of Cheech Marin.

590
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,040
That's what I talk about with stoners.

591
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,880
I was playing some Destiny earlier today

592
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
and I was playing with some randos online.

593
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
Gang, I heard somebody take the longest bong rip I ever heard.

594
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
I thought they were pulling a prank on me.

595
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,800
It was literally a good, probably 45 seconds.

596
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,560
Not a joke, not an exaggeration.

597
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,400
A good like, hey, hold on everybody.

598
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,440
Don't start it up yet.

599
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,680
Go ahead and kill all the stuff in the room

600
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
and I'll be ready for the boss.

601
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,760
Here we go, like 45 seconds.

602
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,480
I felt like I was like going up a hill on a roller coaster

603
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,600
made of a bong.

604
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,320
That was nothing.

605
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,520
I was sitting here trying to formulate

606
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,920
a rookie of the year version joke of like,

607
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,040
maybe this person had asthma, damaged their lungs

608
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,760
and now they're able to take these ridiculous rips.

609
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,040
I couldn't get there.

610
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,280
The doctor said the only treatment

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,200
for my rookie's bump is giant bong rips.

612
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,040
It's just juicy rips.

613
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
Hey, I got a quick Yahoo here.

614
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,760
This one was sent in by Erica Batty.

615
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,480
Thank you, Erica.

616
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

617
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,800
if you die hungry, is your ghost hungry forever?

618
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,760
Please don't answer this with ghosts aren't real.

619
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
I know there's no physical proof,

620
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
but I'm erring on the side of caution.

621
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
Always so smart when you're talking about the supernatural.

622
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,040
You're driving down the road heading to Hardee's

623
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,760
and you've got a hearty hunger and you're growing in your belly

624
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,800
and you got to get there soon because you're not you

625
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
and you're hungry and you do a quick like cool hairpin turn

626
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,640
into the Hardee's drive through and you flip the car, explode.

627
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,480
Yeah, and you've died hungry and there's your ghost.

628
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
It can never enter the Hardee's and even if it could

629
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
and couldn't eat the tangible burgers,

630
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,400
is your ghost hungry forever?

631
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Hungry forever.

632
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm just going to go ahead and mention

633
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
that in Hello from the Magic Tavern,

634
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,240
they do discuss the hunger ghost, so it's okay.

635
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
You don't need to tweet at us about that.

636
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
You have a ghost.

637
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
It's never sated, right?

638
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,040
We have a finite number of resources on this planet,

639
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,960
a finite amount of resources on this planet.

640
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,280
This ghost could eat their way through our food supply

641
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
and really put our whole ecosystem in something of a bind

642
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,840
because the ghost could just single-handedly eat up

643
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,480
all our dang hot dogs and all of our good stuff.

644
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
The ghost could just chomp it all down.

645
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Now here's my question, J-Man.

646
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,440
When I eat a sandwich, does that create a ghost sandwich?

647
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,520
We've definitely talked about this before.

648
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,920
What does that say about us?

649
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,280
I know, it's a bummer.

650
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,800
What does that say about us?

651
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,080
No, it's rough, but listen,

652
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,760
does this carry over to all known desires?

653
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,400
If I really want to listen to Dave Matthews' band,

654
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
but first I'm going to use the toilet

655
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,520
and I definitely die on it,

656
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,960
then am I always going to be floating around Spectral World

657
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
just like, damn, I'd love to hear Ian's marching right now,

658
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,280
but my wife is too sad to turn on his feel-good tunes.

659
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,120
I think that the worst sensation to die with

660
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,800
and have forever is being afraid.

661
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,400
Like if you die of fright

662
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,800
and then you're just a scared ghost forever

663
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,640
because what are you going to do as a ghost to not be scared?

664
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Maybe sleepy.

665
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,720
Sleepy's also bad.

666
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,560
Sleepy ghost would be all right

667
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,000
because what else are you going to do?

668
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,480
That's fair.

669
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,040
What if I have to go to the bathroom ghost?

670
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,160
That's no good because then you can never...

671
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
See, yours is so bad.

672
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Mine was pretty good.

673
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
If you're a sleepy ghost, then it's like,

674
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,800
well, I'm in this big spooky mansion.

675
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
I've read all the books by floating through them as I do

676
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
and I don't have anything to do,

677
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
but I'm always really sleepy,

678
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,880
so I'm just going to sack out for a few hundred years.

679
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Maybe some neighborhood kids will wander in here.

680
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
I'll give them a little spookeroonie.

681
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,600
Get out and turn the light off on your way.

682
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,840
Please.

683
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,480
Maybe crank down that AC a couple degrees

684
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,280
and turn on the fan in the bedroom.

685
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,760
Give me some white noise.

686
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,320
The horny.

687
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,440
I feel like horny ghost is a phrase my mouth has said before

688
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,520
and I can't think of a reason it would happen other than this show.

689
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
Should we put an embargo on ghost jokes then?

690
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
Well, you might need a moratorium if you will.

691
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,840
So now that we know that this is the last ghost bit,

692
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,800
let's talk about some of our favorite ghostly memories

693
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

694
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,720
Some of our favorite ghost humor we've ever done.

695
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
Wow, I can't think of one good one.

696
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:31,680
So maybe let's go to the money zone.

697
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,360
Folks, our first sponsor this week is Bowl and Branch.

698
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,240
Don't you get excited when you know you get to slip in

699
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,760
to your spectral sheets and give yourself a nice ghostly nap.

700
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,240
If you're a ghost that's going to sleep for 100 years,

701
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,120
you should do it on the best sheets available from Bowl and Branch.

702
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,520
And they're made from pure 100% organic cotton.

703
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,400
They start out super soft and you know where they go from there?

704
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
Did you guess less soft?

705
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,480
You're incorrect because they get softer over time.

706
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
Lots of great reviews.

707
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,440
Shipping is free.

708
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
You could try them for 30 nights and if you don't love them,

709
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,560
send them back for a refund.

710
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,400
I also want to say, not just sheets,

711
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,880
I've got a set of towels from Bowl and Branch.

712
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh yeah.

713
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,200
And I've had them now for like, you know, almost a year,

714
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,560
maybe over a year and unlike some towels I've had,

715
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,160
the more I wash them, like they stay consistently

716
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,360
that like soft fluffy new towel kind of feeling.

717
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
Love that, need that.

718
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,200
Love these towels.

723
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Hey, Stitch Fix.

724
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah?

725
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,960
How's it going, pal?

726
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm going to talk about you for a minute.

727
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,840
Hey, Stitch Fix though, just thanks.

728
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,000
Kind of don't love you being here in the room while I do it.

729
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,880
I kind of need my space.

730
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,760
No, go ahead.

731
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,960
I like to watch.

732
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh no.

733
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,120
Here's your $200.

734
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
Go ahead.

735
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Talk about the service.

736
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:15,920
All right.

737
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,840
They send you a-

738
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
Just let me know if I can-

739
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,200
Slower.

740
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,640
All right.

741
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,400
So just because a sense of style can be elusive for some

742
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
doesn't mean it's impossible to attain.

743
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,440
Discover the style you never knew you had with a little help from Stitch.

744
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Sorry, can you put your shirt back on?

745
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,720
Just, yeah, but I just got five new ones in a box from myself.

746
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,280
So I'm going to change into one of these new looks,

747
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,120
and I'd like you to give me your feedback.

748
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,240
All right, go ahead.

749
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,400
Yeah, they're all really good.

750
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,880
I mean, you bought them for yourself, so it's not like-

751
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,320
Well, I didn't actually.

752
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,400
I had one of the people that work inside of me choose them.

753
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,840
They got my favorite, I told them my favorite styles and my budget,

754
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,280
and they selected five brand new clothing, I guess, just for me.

755
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,480
No, I can see them rattling around inside of you when I'm not here.

756
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,200
Whenever you move.

757
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,560
You're huge, by the way.

758
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,560
So anyway, what you do is you answer some questions about your sizes,

759
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
favorite styles and budget,

760
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,400
and your personal stylist will hand-select five brand new clothing items just for you.

761
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,360
You send back anything you don't want, and shipping's free both ways,

762
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,840
so you only pay for what you keep.

763
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,680
My size is extra.

764
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,800
What's that?

765
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,040
Extra.

766
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
You just are extra?

767
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Yes, extra me.

768
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
So you can get your fix whenever you want, regardless of which size you wear,

769
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
even if that size is company.

770
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,000
Or you can sign up to receive scheduled shipments.

771
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,960
Hurry to stitchfix.com slash my brother to get started now.

772
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,640
Keep all five items you receive, and you'll get 25% off your entire purchase.

773
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
Go to stitchfix.com.

774
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,080
What?

775
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,920
I didn't approve that.

776
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,800
That's just too great of a deal.

777
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm gonna go broke with that kind of a deal.

778
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,840
Well, you want me to holler around inside of you and see if I can find the culprit?

779
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Yes, look, check my armpit for Jerry.

780
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,520
He's a new guy, and I think he's the kind of nincompoop that would have a dumb idea

781
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:26,640
like going to stitchfix.com slash my brother and keep 25% off when you keep all five items.

782
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,840
That sounds like a Jerry original.

783
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,040
Okay.

784
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,920
Trav, you want to read this next message?

785
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,040
I sure do, Griffin.

786
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Thank you for asking.

787
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,920
Are you getting married and you want a beautiful memory to last a lifetime?

788
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,800
Find a woman that could satisfy me.

789
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,760
Stitch Fix.

790
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,720
Oh, goodness.

791
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
Oh, I thought he'd be gone.

792
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,760
Hey, Stitch Fix, listen.

793
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,720
I swear, I've seen Blue Apron eyeing you from the other side of the room.

794
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,520
Yes, this will do.

795
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
Okay, now that we've-

796
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,880
I need someone with access to plentiful scallions.

797
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes, so now that we've got two companies get married, Travis, maybe start this message

798
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
from a different sort of corporate sponsor going.

799
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,560
Are you getting married and want a beautiful memory to last a lifetime?

800
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Are you also huge geeks and don't want to be judged for cutting your cake with a replica

801
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
of Sting?

802
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,720
Then have-

803
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
Wait, the artist?

804
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,080
Don't cut your cake with me.

805
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
That was stupid.

806
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
Then we got the videographer for you.

807
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,320
David Trothright will film your wedding and make it look as epic as you always knew it

808
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,040

Spell yahoo.

814

What?

815
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,120
Spell yahoo, Travis.

816
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,600
You can't stop.

817
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,120
Spell yahoo also.

818
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,520
Y-A-H-O-O dot C-O-M.

819
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,320
Thank you.

820
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,600
For all your geek wedding videography needs.

821
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,560
I have a message for Eli, and it's from Reina, and it goes a little something like this.

822
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,840
To my very good big brother Eli, surprise.

823
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,040
I honestly don't even have anything important to say here.

824
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,640
I had an extra hundo lying around and just thought it'd be cool to sneak this up on you.

825
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Now, listen to one of the Mackle boys say these funny words.

826
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,880
Bumfuzzle.

827
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, Justin, I'm so sorry, dude.

828
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,280
Caddywampus.

829
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,840
I'm so sorry you lost the luck of the draw here, pal.

830
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,560
Boopers, I deserved it for the Stitch Fix thing.

831
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
I mean, I lost us a sponsor.

832
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,080
The least I can do is earn us a hundred bucks.

833
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,600
That's all, I guess.

834
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,040
Thanks, boys.

835
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
Love you lots.

836
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,920
And that's from Eli, from Reina.

837
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,400
You kind of messed up this attribution there.

838
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,160
That one is from Reina to Eli.

839
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,040
Good job.

840
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,480
Here's a message for Angela, and it's from Scott, who says, dearest Angela, you are the

841
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,640
most important person of all time, and you are taking the world by storm.

842
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:27,520
Chumbo and Numbo, my favorite Pawn Stars characters, now bow before your glowing righteousness.

843
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,640
You are vibing and keeping it tight in ways that other humans cannot begin to fathom.

844
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Your power is endless.

845
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
You are a new god.

846
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,640
The earth trembles before you today, the day of your birth.

847
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,840
Sweet Jesus.

848
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,080
Are we supposed to be as scared of Angela as I am in this moment?

849
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,040
I think Angela is powerful and radical.

850
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,120
I am trembling.

851
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah, I'm really glad we got to share.

852
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,240
Oh, no, she just stepped on my house with her huge foot.

853
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah, she's big, powerful.

854
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,320
Too bad.

855
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Hey, this is John Roderick of America.

856
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
I know that guy.

857
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,000
He also made the theme song for my brother, My Brother and Me.

858
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,040
And you've teamed up with your friend, Adam, and a guy you also know, Ben Harrison.

859
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,120
Hey, you're my friend.

860
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,480
And we make a war movie podcast called Friendly Fire.

861
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,800
Now, you may be turned off by the premise right then and there, but you would be wrong.

862
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,880
Well, it's because it's about so much more than war or war films.

863
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,840
War movies are also a great window into filmmaking and the way our culture thinks of itself and

864
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,400
other cultures think of themselves.

865
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,320
So listen to Friendly Fire on MaximumFun.org every Friday, or get it wherever you get podcasts.

866
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,040
Oh, thank god.

867
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,780
What?

868
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
We got a new fuzz box.

869
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,120
Is this Diamond Dave?

870
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,840
What's going on?

871
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,560
Oh, Jesus.

872
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
His guitar got very sick.

873
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,620
Okay, so-

874
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,920
I want a Munch Squad.

875
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,800
I want too much squad.

876
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,320
Juicy, you need to get down to Guitar Center, bud, and get that shit looked at.

877
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
I gotta get this thing in the shop.

878
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,480
I've been having to do a lot of Munch Squads lately where the copy is the star of the show

879
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,040
because the products haven't been as really buck wild as we need to get on a Munch Squad,

880
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,760
a podcast within a podcast, profiling the latest and greatest in the quick service restaurant

881
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,320
industry.

882
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,360
But I want to say thank you, fuzzolies.

883
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:48,160
As I've said no times on the toilet, thank you, fuzzolies, for bringing the heat with

884
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
the new breadstick sliders.

885
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,720
Now, if you're in the Indianapolis area, you may have seen these spring up here at the

886
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,720
test market for these bad boys, and they're just as terrifying as they sound.

887
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,600
You know the fuzzolies breadsticks that they used to bring you infinite of if you were

888
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,440
seated at the table, but now don't do that anymore, I don't think.

889
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,080
The breadsticks, the very-

890
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,680
You know the super sloppy ones that seem like eating even one is a dare kind of scenario?

891
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,400
You know what I mean?

892
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Yeah, these little salty little missiles.

893
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,720
Yeah, so what they've done is they've cut one of those motherfuckers in half and stuffed

894
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
a bunch of pepperoni in there.

895
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,640
They're perfect as a, it says here, shareable snack.

896
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,040
Now let's not think about, let's think about that for a second.

897
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,200
A shareable snack doesn't seem like one thing should be a shareable snack.

898
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Like if you come to me and you say, I've been snacking on this breadstick full of pepperoni,

899
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,840
would you like to share it with me?

900
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,360
I think the answer would almost always be no, thank you very much.

901
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,400
Perfect as a shareable snack throughout the day.

902
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,680
What?

903
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,360
I know they don't mean that like it sounds.

904
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,440
I know they don't mean like, oh, I'm gonna put the rest of you in the Ziploc baggy.

905
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
See you at 3 p.m.

906
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,760
It sounds almost like-

907
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,200
One third of a breadstick slider.

908
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,080
Because you talk to your friend and you say you got anything going on from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

909
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,560
Because we're gonna eat these all day as science.

910
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,000
These are an all days thing.

911
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,080
The revolutionary new ways to indulge in these famous breadsticks include,

912
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,080
the revolutionary, words mean things, you know?

913
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,280
Pepperoni pizza breadsticks.

914
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,960
Each order includes six of Fizzoli's signature garlic breadstick halves,

915
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,760
and then they top them with mozzarella and pepperoni,

916
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,280
and then they bake them to a golden perfection.

917
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,480
So what they've done, if you can visualize this, oh, they're served with marinara for dipping.

918
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,320
These savory cheesy pull apart breadsticks are perfect to share,

919
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,120
or keep all to yourself, or share.

920
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,600
Wait, please share.

921
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,440
If you can visualize that, they've cut the breadsticks in half and then dump pizza on them.

922
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,840
These are breadstick size, right?

923
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,800
Like these are very thin, very thin, non sandwich size.

924
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah, so you can get, it's like one pepperoni width max, maybe.

925
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,760
Maybe.

926
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,920
The Italian breadstick sliders are Fizzoli's signature garlic breadstick halves

927
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,320
made into slider buns and filled with fresh premium ingredients

928
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,160
to create three new Italian breadstick sliders.

929
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,080
You can't just keep saying that.

930
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,280
A smashed meatball breadstick slider.

931
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,160
That's two meatballs topped with Fizzoli's signature marinara sliced mozzarella

932
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,960
baked and finished with a garlic, sorry, a basil pesto drizzle,

933
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,480
and they don't detail why it's a smashed meatball breadstick slider,

934
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,840
but I think we can all guess.

935
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, they just can't stop fucking it up.

936
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,960
There's a spicy Italian breadstick slider that's sliced genoa salami and capicola

937
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,520
and a meatball topped with sliced mozzarella and baked and topped with a pepperoncini.

938
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,120
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm trying not to laugh,

939
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,400
but I was just thinking that probably the most fucked up thing you could do as a farmer

940
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,840
is to look at a pig right before you butcher it and tell it that it's going to be-

941
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:27,280
The components are going to be used in a spicy Italian breadstick slider.

942
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,600
It's just the meanest, it's like, I can't imagine a war of dignity.

943
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,480
The pig's like, I'm at least going to Olive Garden, right?

944
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,600
And the farmer's like, oh no, friend, you're not an Olive Garden pig.

945
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,320
Oh no, you're not an Olive Garden pig.

946
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,760
Culinary manager Rick Petralia has one of the more sinister

947
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,320
sounding Munch Squad quotes I've encountered.

948
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,280
We listen and pay attention to our guests' tastes and preferences

949
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,960
in order to craft menu items that we know they'll enjoy.

950
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,480
So that's like, Rick's like, yeah, we've been watching you dirty sons of bitches.

951
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,960
We got close, we smelled the stinkier trash hole of a mouth.

952
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,560
We know what you put in there.

953
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,480
Our guests love our signature unlimited breadsticks.

954
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
So we set out, so I guess they are still unlimited,

955
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,600
so we set out to create more ways for them to be enjoyed.

956
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,920
You asked for this and now you've got it.

957
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
You've got it, you dirty pigs.

958
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,800
We're excited to give our loyal fans in Indianapolis

959
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,000
the first chance to try these delicious new menu items.

960
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,120
They are the perfect snack for any occasion.

961
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,600
After all, life is always better with breadsticks.

962
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,920
What the fuck are you talking about, Rick?

963
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
What are you saying?

964
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,560
I also think using this word snack is this like-

965
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
Snack on it.

966
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,920
Take it with you and then, you know, when the moment comes

967
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
and you'll know when it is, snack on it.

968
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,720
If I saw someone pull one of these out on the subway,

969
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,760
I would jump right out of the door onto the tracks to my death.

970
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,800
No way, because I don't know what that person's capable.

971
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,120
Actually, I do know what that person's capable of.

972
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,080
I just finished up lunch at Fazoli's a couple hours ago

973
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,520
and I got a couple more hours until I can go back to Fazoli's for dinner.

974
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,840
I wish there was something in between that I could do to kind of tide me over.

975
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
A cheesy boat across the river sticks.

976
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,160
That is the-

977
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,800
Quick.

978
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,560
Can I say something though, right at this moment?

979
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,840
Yeah, fuck these up.

980
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,280
Yeah, I would annihilate.

981
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,200
God, I would annihilate them.

982
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,880
I'm coming to Indianapolis to eat these dirty, dirty treats.

983
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,480
I'm coming and hey, I'm announcing on my brother,

984
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,960
my brother and me show in Indianapolis just to eat these nasty boats.

985
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,640
Hey, how about a yahoo?

986
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,720
Yeah, give it to me.

987
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
Here's one that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thanks, Graham.

988
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,360
It's anonymous yahoo answers user, so I'm gonna call him...

989
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,440
Ruggie.

990
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,000
Ruggie asks, how does one become a ship captain?

991
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,840
I don't mean a captain of a cruise ship or being a captain as a career.

992
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,880
I just mean in general.

993
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,280
For instance, let's just say I bought a boat for myself and my family.

994
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
How do you determine who is the captain?

995
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,320
Or another example, how would Jack Sparrow have become a captain?

996
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,960
I don't mean all the technical stuff about Davy Jones and all that,

997
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
because I know that part of it.

998
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,680
I just mean that obviously he didn't go to university or college

999
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,000
and professionally obtain a license to be captain,

1000
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,320
so how does that all work these days?

1001
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,760
Okay, first of all yahoo answers question asker Ruggie,

1002
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,440
how dare you undercut the Pirates of the Caribbean point

1003
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,440
I was going to make about how Jack Sparrow became a captain?

1004
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,760
How dare you take Travis's joke away from him?

1005
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,200
How dare you?

1006
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,560
I was going to talk about how he made a deal with Davy Jones

1007
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,200
to raise the Black Pearl from the bottom of the ocean

1008
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,400
and then by granting him a ship that allowed him to become a captain,

1009
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
and you took that from me.

1010
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,640
You know, Travis, though, I think you found a way somehow.

1011
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,120
What? Oh.

1012
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,680
I'm so glad we got those little peaks and valleys into the waveform.

1013
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,840
You can imagine my relief at that.

1014
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,000
You know, I've never seen a yahoo answers person that is so belligerent,

1015
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,880
so on guard about learning information that they are not actively seeking out.

1016
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,520
Yeah, sure.

1017
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,760
They have built an impenetrable logical fortress around themselves

1018
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,720
to keep themselves from any general tidbit that they're not actively seeking out.

1019
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,880
So the scenario presented here that I was attracted to

1020
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,040
is I buy a boat for myself and my family.

1021
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,560
How do you determine who's the captain?

1022
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,680
Is it the one?

1023
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,080
Let's say the three of us get together and we're out on the big lake

1024
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,160
and I say, I got a surprise for everybody.

1025
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,600
I bought a big boat.

1026
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,640
Am I the captain just because I'm the one that dished out the cash for it?

1027
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,040
Because I'm not convinced that I would be the best captain.

1028
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,920
No, Griffin.

1029
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,080
Captain is something that like everyone knows about somebody.

1030
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,160
And it's just like, you have to say everybody on three point to the person who is the captain.

1031
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,560
And I guarantee you nine times out of ten, everyone's going to point at the same person.

1032
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,440
Everyone will just inherently be like, that is the captain.

1033
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,600
Because it's not a position that's earned or granted or anything.

1034
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,880
One is just born a captain or else why would you be allowed to like perform weddings and stuff

1035
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,320
and throw people in the brig if it just meant nothing?

1036
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,120
You know what I mean?

1037
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,400
Like you are preordained to be a captain at birth.

1038
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,600
It's like when Martin Short inherited a boat and he went down to go look at it

1039
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,160
and he had no idea what to do.

1040
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,160
He wandered the street.

1041
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,560
There's that 15 minute scene in Captain Ron of him wandering the streets of the place in Florida,

1042
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,200
I guess.

1043
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,160
And until he found a captain and he couldn't do it himself,

1044
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,840
even though he had written and read several books about nautical matters.

1045
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,720
Yeah, he knew.

1046
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,920
He was a boat scholar.

1047
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,720
He knew the information, but he hadn't absorbed it.

1048
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,080
It wasn't in his marrow.

1049
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,120
Of the waves.

1050
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,840
Yes.

1051
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,040
I have a theory, by the way, listener, that I'd like to put in your brain

1052
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,560
because I think about it all the time.

1053
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,680
I developed a theory upon one of my many viewings of Captain Ron.

1054
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,800
You know how that one diehard movie, Die Hard with a Vengeance,

1055
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,120
was originally written as a lethal weapon film?

1056
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,560
You guys know this bit of trivia and then they repurposed it as a diehard film?

1057
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,600
Absolutely not.

1058
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,280
I didn't know that.

1059
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,800
I have this theory that Captain Ron was originally written as a national lampoon film,

1060
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
which I assume would have been titled National Lampoon's Caribbean Vacation.

1061
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,640
Because if you think about, if you replace Chevy Chase in the Martin Short role

1062
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,520
and then you replace Captain Ron with Cousin Eddie,

1063
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,400
who for some reason has some sort of nautical knowledge,

1064
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
we can get that in post and figure that in the scripting process.

1065
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, that's why they switched it over.

1066
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,520
They couldn't crack that nut.

1067
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,200
If you replace all that stuff, it is beat for beat what that film would have been.

1068
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,720
That imaginary film that I came up with would have been Captain Ron.

1069
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,360
I would swear on a sack of Bibles it was written as a national lampoon movie

1070
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,160
and no one will ever, one of the vacation films specifically.

1071
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,320
And I've never found any validation of this online,

1072
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,160
but if you're the screenwriter of that film, please get in touch.

1073
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,440
I would like to return to a thought exercise that Travis presented just a few minutes ago

1074
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,680
before we talked about Captain Ron for a long, long time,

1075
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,960
the longest time that's ever been.

1076
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,760
I would like each of us, I'll count to three,

1077
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,320
and then each of us say the name of which of the three of us would be the captain.

1078
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,680
You are allowed to say yourself.

1079
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,720
Okay, okay.

1080
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,320
And I want no hurt feelings.

1081
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't want us to get our ego in this.

1082
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,880
This doesn't mean anything.

1083
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,960
It's a joke for a podcast, but when we do buy a boat,

1084
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,800
it is going to be legally binding.

1085
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,300
Okay.

1086
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,560
One, two, three, Travis.

1087
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,440
Travis.

1088
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,240
Yeah, okay.

1089
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:46,720
Okay, cool.

1090
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,000
I thought that might be the case.

1091
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,960
Now let me say this.

1092
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,440
Let's count to three and everybody say the reason why.

1093
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:58,320
So one, two, three, because you've seen Pirates of the Caribbean.

1094
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Okay, so then we're all on the same-

1095
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,520
Beard, I said beard.

1096
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,800
Oh, you said beard.

1097
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Mine was beard.

1098
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,560
Dang.

1099
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,760
Mine was beard.

1100
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,400
That's a sea beard to catch the salt air.

1101
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,280
That is fair.

1102
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,840
Yeah, that's great.

1103
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,240
We can sort of stand behind Travis and draft on him.

1104
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,920
He's going to get all that nasty salt.

1105
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,840
He's sort of like God's air purifier with that beard.

1106
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,720
Thank you.

1107
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,680
I do like that Griffin and I, our heads were in the same place.

1108
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,480
I was like, Travis has probably the most nautical knowledge

1109
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,760
just through osmosis of seeing Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

1110
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,720
I have a new game.

1111
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,880
It's called Who's the Captain?

1112
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,880
And I'm going to name some casts of some films

1113
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
and you tell me some ensemble casts

1114
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,560
and you're going to tell me who's the captain.

1115
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,960
Okay, now let me ask just to clarify.

1116
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,080
Are we talking about the actors or the characters?

1117
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,080
Oh man, that's tough.

1118
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,160
I think the actors, right?

1119
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,920
Which actor is the most captain-like?

1120
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,320
Okay, this first one starts out hard and it only gets harder.

1121
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,520
The, oh fuck, just give me a fucking ad blocker.

1122
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,440
Fuck, fuck you.

1123
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,240
Damn, it'd be such a shame if we weren't able to do this bit.

1124
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,800
You think?

1125
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,280
Fuck me, I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

1126
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,680
Okay, here we go.

1127
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,960
Oh, thank Christ.

1128
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,920
The Breakfast Club.

1129
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,760
The Breakfast Club.

1130
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,720
We're talking Emilio, talking Molly Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall,

1131
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,560
Judd Nelson, Maya Ringwald.

1132
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,520
Hold on, hold on.

1133
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,400
Ally Sheedy.

1134
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,280
Ally Sheedy.

1135
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,400
Stop the game.

1136
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,040
Okay.

1137
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
There wasn't a boat in Breakfast Club.

1138
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,680
There doesn't have to be a boat.

1139
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,280
There doesn't have to be a boat in it.

1140
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,880
Oh, who is the captain?

1141
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,600
Okay.

1142
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,000
If they all bought a boat, as soon as the movie ended, who's the captain?

1143
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,640
Yeah, okay.

1144
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,600
Well, this is a trick.

1145
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,280
It's a trick question, Justin.

1146
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,240
Why is that?

1147
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,320
Because I think that Emilio Estevez will be appointed captain,

1148
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,360
but by the end of the film, we find out that like Judd Nelson is the captain.

1149
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,800
See, I was going to say Molly Ringwald.

1150
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,120
This is not the best game, though.

1151
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,240
It's the only problem.

1152
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,360
Okay.

1153
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,000
Let's try it again.

1154
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,400
Maybe the first round was just a little off.

1155
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Steven Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Chas Balmentieri,

1156
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,160
and Kevin Spacey.

1157
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,600
Okay, I know who's not the captain.

1158
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,160
Yeah, I know who's going to get kill hauled.

1159
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,360
The usual suspects.

1160
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,000
So we're going to say, who of those people is the captain?

1161
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,800
Are you ready?

1162
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,520
Kevin Pollack.

1163
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah, that's who I was leaning to.

1164
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,160
See, I was thinking Benicio.

1165
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,800
I was going to give him the captainship.

1166
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Okay, let me give you-

1167
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,320
Look around your friends, your friend group, and see if you can figure out who the-

1168
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,240
Which one of them is the captain?

1169
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,040
Okay, I have one to pitch for you.

1170
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay.

1171
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,280
Star Trek First Contact.

1172
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,440
Who's the captain?

1173
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,360
Who's the captain of that one?

1174
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,880
On Star Trek First Cap-

1175
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,320
Worf!

1176
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,560
That one's Worf.

1177
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,440
That one is Worf.

1178
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,120
On that one, it's Worf.

1179
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,120
His name is already a boat thing.

1180
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,360
Related.

1181
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,760
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our dumb, dumb podcast.

1182
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,240
My brother, my brother, me, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1183
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,200
We know we've enjoyed having you.

1184
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,400
One to mention, as always, at the beginning of a month, I guess it's sort of,

1185
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,000
we're getting closer to mid-month now, as unfathomable as that may be,

1186
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,720
we've got a new pin in the McElroy Merch Squad, which you can find at McElroyMerch.com.

1187
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:30,480
This month's new pin is a beautiful shrimp with Angelic Halo on it, designed by Elena Hoyt.

1188
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,120
You can find that pin, along with a lot of other great merchandise.

1189
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,000
That one's only available through June, though, so make sure you get that if you want it.

1190
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,360
I also want to say we have the San Francisco and Phoenix shows coming up.

1191
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,640
Thanks, San Francisco.

1192
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
Yeah, well, in fact, I know San Francisco's called out.

1193
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,520
I think there are still some tickets to that Phoenix show.

1194
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,560
So if you want to join us, you can go to McElroyShows.com

1195
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,200
tours and get your tickets there.

1196
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,920
And you can also get tickets to our other upcoming shows in Orlando and Atlanta,

1197
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,720
as well as our Adventure Zone graphic novel book tour, which is coming up in mid-July.

1198
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,440
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1199
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,520
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1200
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,640
It's got all the songs on it ever recorded.

1201
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,480
So Saturday Night Fever, all of the other songs.

1202
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,920
And that's all on Putting the Days to Bed by the Long Winters.

1203
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,680
And thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

1204
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,520
You can go to MaximumFun.org.

1205
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,880
Check out all the great shows there.

1206
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,160

You all want that final?

1210
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:40,960
Yeah.

1211
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,920
You know it.

1212
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,440
It was sent in by Andy Schiff.

1213
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,000
Thanks, Andy.

1214
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,200
It's Yahoo Answers user?

1215
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,520
Question mark, so I'll call him.

1216
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,880
Bernardf asks,

1217
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,400
is the ASS all that matters these days?

1218
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,320
Mine is just McElroy and I vote yes.

1219
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,840
I'm Travis McElroy and the research just isn't in yet.

1220
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,440
My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm not-

1221
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,160
This is gross.

1222
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,200
I'm not going to joke about that.

1223
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,360
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1224
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,240
Kiss your dad.

1225
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,520
Square on the lips.

1226
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,320

00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,360

Listener supported.

1230
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,600
We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

1231
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,120
You drink a little too much.

1232
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,320
You don't actually read the book.

1233
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,440
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

1234
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,880
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

1235
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,320
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

1236
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,480
We do not require guac.

1237
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,920
We require only nutrients and expansion.

1238
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,080
You will become book club.

1239
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,640
You will eat, pray and love with us.

1240
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,560
Join book club.

1241
