1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,200
Bienvenidos. I'm your littlest brother, baby brother Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,440
Limps. Limpos. Here's looking at you, Limpos. It's the talented Mr. Olympus.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
Give me those five rings. I'm gonna put them all on my fingers and show off my beautiful

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
rings to my friends, Olympos. Just like Sonic the Hedgehog, we're after them rings.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,480
That's right. Americans and Chinese and other people are all on the hunt for those five rings.

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,880
All of them. Americans, Chinese, France, and the other ones.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,160
Five rings of various colors have been hidden throughout Rio de Janeiro,

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,840
and these proud Olympians must work together to follow the clues to find all the five rings.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,160
One of them you only find through geocaching. One of them you got to solve the mummy's tomb,

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,840
I think. Just looking at the lineup of people looks like both big Australia and little Australia

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
made it out to this one. Welcome to the Limpos, boys. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so happy.

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
Now this is why we sports. This is it.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
But this year there is a team, and I thought that this was very profound,

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,360
there is a team comprised entirely of people who thought Batman vs. Superman was, you know,

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,880
not too bad. And it's strange that they have like a flag and everything. They're in the UN,

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,920
and they're our strongest NATO ally. Yep.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,680
Do want to say just 18 hours after this year's Limpos began, I am very proud to announce that

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,400
West Virginia, a West Virginian, won the state's first gold for this ceremony.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Not just any West Virginian.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Not just any West Virginian and not just any sport.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
What sport did West Virginia roll up and crush it in? You guessed it, shooting things.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
We took the golden gun, and her name is Virginia Thrasher,

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
which is so fucking choice and money and good.

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Yeah, she actually goes by Jenny Thrasher. How fucking cool is that?

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,320
Thank you to Jenny Thrasher for the inspiration, and this episode is dedicated to you.

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,160
And it inspired me watching Jenny Thrasher get up there and just gun, like, and gun so tight.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
I decided that I'm going to take part in the 2020 Olympos.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
Oh man, me too. Griffin, I've actually been training already.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
What are you training in?

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm training in swimming, mostly the butterfly.

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,160
Okay. I've been training with Michael Fred Phelps,

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,800
who is Michael Phelps' dad, and who unfortunately shares a name with Fred Phelps.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,680
Yeah, that's too bad. So you swim and he's like, you could have done that a little bit faster.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,920
Also, I don't think that bisexual people should be able to vote.

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,640
Yeah.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
Fred Phelps, why?

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
If you swim better, God will kill people because he's ashamed of you.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, okay.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I decided that I think I'm going to do leg wrestling.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,840
And I'm really excited to get there.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,640
No one's quite sure where the 2020 Olympics are going to be.

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,160
A lot of people said, and I say that, and I'm looking at our producer now,

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,480
and the producer is letting me know, just sort of emphatically,

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,520
that a whole sort of panel got together and decided it would be in Tokyo.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
No, no, no.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm still not sure.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,440
They say that, but at the last minute they're going to send out like Wonka-esque tickets

54
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,960
to let you know where to go because they just don't want it swamped by like spectators and

55
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,920
visitors.

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
They just want to keep it pure for the sport.

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400
Now it is going to be in Tokyo.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Apparently I'm getting it.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
They're just really emphatic.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,680
It's in Tokyo.

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,520
And I would love to show everybody how I leg wrestle in the Japanese style.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm looking forward to that.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah, I thought you were going to demonstrate it here on the call somehow.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,640
We're not even close to each other, but my leg is in the air right now and I'm flailing it.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
Justin, what sport?

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
What sport?

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,840
No Oddjob Goldeneye.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,680
Oh!

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
I've been pushing for a long time and finally we got it in.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,400
They've had Goldeneye for a long time, but I think me and a lot of the other E-athletes,

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,160
or E-athletes as we prefer,

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Or E-athletes!

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
E-athletes!

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
Prefer, like we thought it was unfair that whatever country got the first controller

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
just like quickest on the draw got to be Oddjob and we just didn't think Oddjob should be in.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,240
So we protested and eventually we got, now the Olympics have no Oddjob Goldeneye,

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Oddjob Goldeneye and all slappers.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh, is it all licensed to kill?

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
Yeah, that's a good question.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,480
Yeah, obviously they don't want these matches to drone on for hours on end.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,120
But I'm really happy to represent my country and not choose Oddjob.

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,760
You know, I have a secret strategy though that I've been working on.

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,800
I wanted to share with you guys.

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,160
Tell me now.

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Come in real close because I don't want the Ruskies to hear.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,520
Uh-huh.

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm going to choose Oddjob.

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,080
Well now hold on.

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
I've just changed my mind.

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,960
Leg wrestling is out the window because it seems like it'd be very difficult and very taxing.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,920
And I'm looking at the list now and there's a lot of exciting new opportunities.

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,000
I think I'm going to go with beach curling.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,640
Oh, okay.

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,360
Oh, that's fun.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,960
It's a new curling.

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,640
It takes place on the beach and the course is much shorter.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I have actually switched mine now too.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,520
I'm going to switch my major and I'm going to start studying for slowest runner.

99
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
And it's the last person across the finish line loses.

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
These races can take months.

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
They take a while.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,360
Yeah.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Take a long time.

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
The last person like missed their family really because that's how most people are just like,

105
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,360
I want to go.

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
I would love to go home.

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm actually going to be doing metal detecting this year.

108
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Changing it up again, huh?

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,480
Yeah, it's nice.

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,360
The really nice thing about it is you can walk into anybody else's event just midway through

111
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
and just do your biz.

112
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,840
You know what I mean?

113
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,640
You could stop the beach volleyball midway through and just do the thing.

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm actually going to switch mine too.

115
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
Oh, Travis is just going to switch his real quick.

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm going to switch mine to mystery barbecuing.

117
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,640
Interesting.

118
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,720
What does that entail?

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
Well, you get the meat, but you don't know what the meat is ahead of time or even during sometimes.

120
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
And you just serve it to the people and you have to prepare.

121
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,760
Usually blindfolded and you're just given a strange meat that you have to cook and prepare.

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,440
Hold on one second.

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
I got to grab my phone.

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
Hey, I need to cancel my application for beach curling.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,760
This is Griffin McElroy.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
Yeah, change that for me.

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,920
Devil sticks, 100 meter.

128
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
Devil sticks.

129
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
Devil sticks, 100 meter.

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, bye.

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,640
I've changed mine again.

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm going to have to change mine one more time.

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Travis is just changing his real quick.

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to have to do head to head yo-yoing.

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,800
Okay.

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
Okay, a lot of tangled up strings in that one.

137
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,200
And it can get bloody in there.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,480
A lot of black eyes, a lot of walked dogs.

139
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah.

140
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,600
It can get very violent in there.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Sending an email real quick.

142
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,840
Cancel devil sticks order application and change to fencing.

143
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,240
Send.

144
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
That's fencing with fans?

145
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,280
With dance.

146
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
You were close, but it was sort of a dance fencing.

147
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
It's just sort of a fencing.

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,240
Fencing?

149
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
No, actually, I'm sorry.

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Changing that.

151
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,160
Instead, I'd like to do fancing.

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
And that's just where you get as fancy as you can get.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
And you just sort of, you have a contest with it.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,800
Okay.

155
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
My pager's going off.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Looking forward to taking the platinum home on that one.

157
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,960
It's even better than gold.

158
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,880
Nobody's ever gotten it before, but I will.

159
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
My pager's going off.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
Hold on one second.

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Let me check it.

162
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,920
Okay.

163
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,360
It's a message to call phone number.

164
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Let me call.

165
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Okay.

166
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
That was me from the future.

167
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,760
I've been informed that I have changed my category in the future to freestyle bad boy.

168
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
Leather jacket, pomade, sunglasses.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Anything goes in freestyle bad boy.

170
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, it's an open field this year because I'm the only one participating.

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680
And I think I could have a good shot at least bronze.

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,280
Oh, I'm going to send an email real quick just if I could.

173
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,480
Let me just switch it.

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm going to switch to synchronized vests and just see.

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, there was an opening.

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,640
I was able to get into the American team.

178
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,360
This is great.

179
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,720
Oh, shit.

180
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, guys, hold on one second.

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,320
Somebody's just thrown a rock through my window and it's, oh, it's me.

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,160
And it's an application from myself.

183
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm changing categories too.

184
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
Let me read here.

185
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
Sorry, the notes really crumpled up.

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
It's wrapped around a rock.

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,640
It just says Richard Gear.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
So I'm going to, I guess I'm changing mine to Richard Gear.

189
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Oh, sorry.

190
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
I just got a notification.

191
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,640
They've actually changed synchronized vesting to world's nicest rap battler now.

192
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,000
So we'll see how it goes.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
Like no cussing.

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
And a lot of compliments.

195
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
It's mostly just flattery, but in rhyming couplets.

196
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,680
Okay, I just got a DM from Olympics and they say that they would prefer that I change

197
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,400
my category this year to no scope surgery, real patients only.

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
And it says XXX on it.

199
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
So I'm not sure that's supposed to be kind of an edgy thing, but I am going to be doing

200
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
surgery, untrained surgery, because you have to be an amateur.

201
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,600
Surgery on real patients without a scope.

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
No scope.

203
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,160
An owl just landed in my window.

204
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,520
It's letting me know that I've been signed up for world's best grandpa.

205
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,800
I don't know.

206
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
I don't even know what I do in that one.

207
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,680
I just got a notification that I received the gold medal for owl impersonation for

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,960
tricking Travis.

209
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,280
What?

210
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
He was an owl the whole time.

211
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Sorry, guys.

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
They just threw another rock through the old window.

213
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
It was already broken.

214
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
I don't even know how they did that.

215
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
But I just got a new category here that apparently I've just been somebody else.

216
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Sign me up for it.

217
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,680
And it just says Olympics.

218
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,760
Super, super, duper weird.

219
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,040
I just got a text message that we have all won the gold medal for Olympics category choosing.

220
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
And the anti-bronze for improv comedy.

221
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
We've actually done so good.

222
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
It's a sort of acid that you apply to bronze and it just sort of dissolves it.

223
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
Yeah, all medals.

224
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,600
Uh, one last fact that I wanted to share with everybody before we move on, uh, West Virginia

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
is shooting domination.

226
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,720
There are five people competing in the Olympics this year that are, uh, uh, West Virginia

227
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
University graduates.

228
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Uh, yeah, yeah.

229
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,440
David Johnson is the manager of the team.

230
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,080
WVU, Jenny Thrasher, Nash.

231
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,880
Here's the best.

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Nico Campionni and Petra Zublasing, both from Italy.

233
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
Italy's like, hold the phone.

234
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
I hear there's a state where people are shooting so right.

235
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
We gotta get them.

236
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,520
It's what we've always raised you to be little one.

237
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,840
Ziva Divorce Act from Slovenia has been called home to shoot shit for her country.

238
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,120
We got this.

239
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,440
Um, should we do advice?

240
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,760
Yeah.

241
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,000
Good.

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,360
Best of luck actually to all of our, um, athletes who are from West Virginia and are

243
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
competing on USA teams only.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
USA, USA.

245
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
Jenny Thrasher, I don't know if you're like, if you got plans now, if you're like on your

246
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,280
way home or whatever, but if you want to dip into another event and just like check shit

247
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,440
out, I ain't mad at you.

248
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Yep.

249
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,800
Just keep winning.

250
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
Just see, just wait till they stop you.

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,400
And if you want to be on our podcast, like judo, let us know.

252
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,760
You can be on our podcast, Jenny.

253
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
That would be sweet.

254
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,240
That'd be dope.

255
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,080
Uh, so let's get into the advice.

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,040
I'm ready if you're ready.

257
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Yes, let's do it.

258
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,840
My friend's dog is extremely unsettling and disturbs me greatly every time I visit.

259
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,000
He has a very human-esque eyes.

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,560
You can see the whites that don't look like a dog's at all and don't reflect in the light.

261
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,800
When I go to the bathroom at night, he's just sitting there waiting for me in the hallway

262
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,640
and he will sit on the couch like a man and watch the TV.

263
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
He was found in the precious.

264
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,680
Oh, sorry.

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
Not precious.

266
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,360
The precious.

267
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
Oh, precious owner.

268
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,480
He was found in the previous owner, told my friend to keep him thus passing on the curse

269
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
to top it all off.

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
He has a human man name.

271
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,520
Everyone loves my friend, tells him his dog's a human man in a dog's body, but he says he's

272
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,040
quote, trying his best.

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Please help.

274
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,400
That's from Spooky Snacks in South Philly.

275
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,360
P.S. It sounds like I embellish this or even made it up for the goof, but please understand

276
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm living in constant fear.

277
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay.

278
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Point of order.

279
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,440
You can't tell us that the dog has a human name and not give us the dog's name, please.

280
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
What's the dog's name?

281
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,600
Bert?

282
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Bert? Let's go with Bert.

283
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Bert is a dog's name, though, that a human used once and thought it was funny.

284
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
Jason.

285
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
How about Ethan?

286
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,360
Okay.

287
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,400
Ethan is excellent.

288
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah, no dog has ever been named Ethan.

289
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,360
Or Aiden.

290
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
Can you imagine a dog named...

291
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,840
Come here, Aiden.

292
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
Roberto Bonini.

293
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
Ethan is good.

294
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,920
So yeah, there's a lot of elements at play here, but I think I pieced all the elements

295
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,400
together in a beautiful puzzle.

296
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,200
And have you seen the trailers for this movie, 9 Lives?

297
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,760
Yes.

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,240
With Jennifer Garner and Kevin Spacey as a cat, and I think that somebody casts like

299
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,280
a wizardly spell on him to turn him into a cat.

300
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
And I think the wizard was...

301
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,200
Oh, it's the guy with the voice that everybody just loves.

302
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,360
It's Walken.

303
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,080
It's Christopher Walken.

304
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,640
It's Walken.

305
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,600
It's Christopher Walken, who I guess only appears in movies to teach dad's lessons with

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,320
magic.

307
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,920
Like, I refuse to believe this is not a spiritual successor to Click.

308
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
Like, it has to be, right?

309
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
It's called Meow.

310
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,840
So in Meow, Kevin Spacey plays a cat, and I think he just loved it so much.

311
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
And after they finished shooting, they're like, thanks, Kevin.

312
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,040
This movie's going to suck ass, but we're going to make so much of that dumb kid money.

313
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
And he's like, I know.

314
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,040
I love it.

315
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,680
Hey, let me ask you a question, Claire.

316
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Is there a real magic man that can turn me into some sort of bedeviled animal?

317
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,320
And they said, geez, Kevin, with that accent constantly, yeah, I think we can hook you

318
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,360
up with somebody.

319
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Bing, bang, boom.

320
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
Long story short, we got a dog Kevin Spacey on our hands.

321
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
True story, though.

322
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,600
What is wrong with you, Kevin?

323
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Yeah, Kev.

324
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Kevin, do you have a second?

325
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,280
Kevin, do you have a second? You went from House of Cards to Elvis and Nixon to 9 Lives.

326
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,120
You're spinning out of control.

327
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,840
You are an American beauty.

328
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,560
Your latest film is currently in post-production and due out 2017.

329
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
I know nothing about it, but it's literally called Baby Driver.

330
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Does the man who made K-Pax have something on you that's blackmailing you into these movies?

331
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Who would make you do this, Kevin?

332
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,840
Maybe K-Pax was a true story.

333
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,760
He's got a fucking alien brain up there and capable of making good decisions.

334
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,480
It can't be the money, right?

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm just worried that maybe we're dealing with a Dave situation where Kevin Spacey is

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
laying like in a sick bed somewhere and they hired an actor who looked like Kevin Spacey

337
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
to play Kevin Spacey.

338
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, I thought you meant meet Dave and you were talking about the similar decline that

339
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
Eddie Murphy did when he threw himself down a well that had a sign in front of it that

340
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
said the Pluto Nash hole.

341
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
No, no, not his Nash hole.

342
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,120
I mean, like the movie, Dave, where maybe Kevin Klein is pretending to be Kevin Spacey.

343
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,160
That's fun.

344
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,120
That's just good fun.

345
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
You're Kevin Spacey, okay?

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah.

347
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,640
Okay, wait, give me a minute.

348
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay.

349
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm there.

350
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,960
Someone slides across a piece of paper from your agent to you.

351
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,040
Your agent slides a piece of paper to you.

352
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,880
It reads, a stuffy businessman finds himself trapped inside the body of his family's cat.

353
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,080
That's the log line.

354
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,520
Where does the cat go?

355
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
Does the cat control Kevin Spacey?

356
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,240
What on earth did they tell Kevin Spacey to get him to agree to appear in this motion

357
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,640
picture?

358
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,600
Yeah.

359
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
And we will give you a lot of money.

360
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Hey, Kevin, it's got, hey, you know Arrow?

361
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,280
His brother's in it.

362
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,160
What?

363
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,440
I remember the first time I saw the trailer for Nine Lives starring Kevin Spacey.

364
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,640
I saw how bad it looked and I actually reached my hand into the screen, like in persona.

365
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,280
And I was able to get like my whole torso and head inside of the trailer.

366
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,640
And I grabbed Jennifer Garner's hands and she was like, pull me out.

367
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,680
You can save me.

368
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,320
And I tried, but my hands were too slippery and greasy and I let her go and she fell back

369
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,280
into the movie.

370
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,440
But I almost got her out.

371
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,280
The first time I saw the preview for Nine Lives, I said out loud to Teresa, I look forward

372
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,680
to hearing the Flophouse episode about that movie.

373
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,360
They already did it.

374
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,800
It was called A Talking Cat.

375
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,200
Anyway.

376
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,320
You said that wrong, Griffin.

377
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
A Talking Cat?

378
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,640
Thank you.

379
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,080
How about we just spent seven minutes just kind of doing fun riffs on Nine Lives.

380
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
And I think just be cool.

381
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
It's a dog and feed it some snacks and be good with it.

382
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,040
And maybe don't do anything too embarrassing around it so that when it turns back into

383
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,440
a human, it's not like, oh, I'm so happy to be human.

384
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
Also, Derek like gets his balls out everywhere.

385
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:42,960
Yeah.

386
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Also, you can set Kevin Spacey free.

387
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
I haven't seen Nine Lives, but it definitely ends with them.

388
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
If they can say their dad's name at the cat, then they transform back.

389
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,480
So you just got to figure out kind of what actor that makes bad choices is the dog and

390
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
just just yell a bunch of names at them.

391
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,920
I mean, start with Kevin Spacey, for God's sakes.

392
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,360
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer from the service?

393
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
No, I just feel like I don't know if we help them or not.

394
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,360
Oh, cool.

395
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
Then we're on par.

396
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,560
This one is sent in by Joel Azose.

397
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,680
Thank you, Joel.

398
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

399
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
Column Chargo.

400
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,640
Chargo asks, what's a cool catch phrase to say before you throw up?

401
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,680
I've always wanted to say something cool before I vomit from drinking too much.

402
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
Any suggestions?

403
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,240
Before, not after?

404
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,880
Yeah, no, it's got to be.

405
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
Well, I think let's free ourselves up.

406
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,960
Let's give ourselves a little bit more comedy rope and say it could be either one.

407
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
But I think it's funny if you say it before to almost announce it.

408
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
And you know, because everybody says something embarrassed when they throw up.

409
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Everybody has a post throw up catchphrase already.

410
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,760
What if you like just before you throw up, you yell like,

411
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,240
I have something to add or I'd like to interject something and then you throw up.

412
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,280
That could be fun.

413
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,480
It's especially good if you're getting really drunk at like an art exhibit or some kind of like

414
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,240
poetry jam somewhere where people are having very like elitist conversations and you can

415
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,800
walk up like, that's a very interesting point about Chaucer.

416
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,320
I have something to add.

417
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I think that's a very interesting point about Chaucer.

418
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,640
I have something to add is a really good catchphrase.

419
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, it's maybe a little bit wordy.

420
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,440
You're going to rush through it.

421
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
Like, you know, it's kind of like, oh, this is very funny.

422
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
Definitely the longer build up you could have before the better.

423
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
I think you should kind of give it like a bard-esque opening.

424
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,040
Sort of like, excuse me, if I could ask everyone to attend the tale, noblemen,

425
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,760
noble ladies, gather round and I shall delight your-

426
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry, if I could have everyone's attention,

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
you're probably wondering why I've called you all here today.

428
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
You have no idea how long it's going to take.

429
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,000
That's the thing about Yards is you never know how long it's going to take, right?

430
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,080
So the inverse, it could also be like, I also have something interesting to add about Chaucer.

431
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,880
Like, what are you doing?

432
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
I think it's very embarrassing to do it.

433
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,720
It's so embarrassing.

434
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,720
It's basically like a bathroom thing.

435
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
And I would never do that in front of a person.

436
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,800
So I think the best thing to do is kind of couch it and just be like,

437
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
what I'm about to do is going to be a prank.

438
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
And so people are like, what the fuck?

439
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,360
You'd be like, pranked you?

440
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,880
Do you think after you peek and look everybody dead in the eye, just be like, just kidding?

441
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh, just before you vermit, you scream, check out these special effects.

442
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
Yeah, and then you do it.

443
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
And then while you're crying, because I cry every single time I throw up,

444
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,920
I just look up everybody and I go, that was fake.

445
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,320
That can be fun.

446
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,680
What if your catchphrase is something like, don't eat the dip.

447
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
And then you threw up.

448
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,280
Yeah, but what if you made the dip?

449
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,840
Oh, no.

450
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
Well, oh, you make the dip every time and then you don't eat the dip.

451
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,320
Because then that also plants into everyone's minds who have had the dip, like, oh, no.

452
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,800
And so they all feel like they're like living on borrowed time.

453
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,720
But then when they don't vomit, they're so relieved that they find a new lease on life.

454
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
Maybe you could go with something like, I was really close to my grandpa.

455
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,280
I used to spend a lot of summers in his cabin.

456
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,680
And I'll never forget his final words to me.

457
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,320
They were, because if you did it enough times, people would eventually be like,

458
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
I wonder if that's, you guys think this will happen?

459
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,560
That might happen.

460
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,600
He's told that story a lot.

461
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,760
What if we're being a little, these are all very good,

462
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
but none of them are really catchphrases.

463
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,040
That's true.

464
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:14,800
A catchphrase is essentially, it establishes a Pavlovian response.

465
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,960
We have to have something so concise and memetic that when you say it,

466
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
people know what's going to happen next.

467
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,840
So maybe just something like in a baby voice, just like, oh,

468
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
and if you say it just like that at a party, people are like,

469
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
oh, damn, where's Jerry?

470
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,320
Get him outside.

471
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
What about something a little bit more t-shirt like,

472
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
bada bing, bada boom, give me some room, right?

473
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,320
Still very, you're gonna, uh-oh, you cannot,

474
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
yarts in the middle of, because the word itself sounds like a yart.

475
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,080
That could, you'd be like, bada bing, bada boom.

476
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
What if you just yell, Omar coming?

477
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Omar coming could be fun, but it's taken and used.

478
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh, not like this.

479
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
80s kids will love this one.

480
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
Um, uh, maybe right before you puke, you say,

481
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,480
first find the orange flag, get some free Casio keyboard,

482
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
and then just puke everywhere.

483
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,640
Kind of give them, or maybe just if you want to get simple,

484
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,280
just physical challenge, then puke everywhere.

485
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah, because it is a physical challenge.

486
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
It is a physical challenge.

487
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

488
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,360
What if you just yelled like, hold my arms back?

489
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
Because it's confusing, because most of the time you would say hair,

490
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
and it would leave people wondering what you usually do with your arms

491
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,800
when you vomit.

492
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,840
But sometimes my arms and back.

493
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
That would be a good one.

494
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
That puke you like is going to come back into style.

495
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
Then just puke on everybody.

496
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,080
And then after you puke, you just look at them and go, damn fine.

497
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,440
And that's fun.

498
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,160
That's fun.

499
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,880
Kind of cultural.

500
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
That's the thing that people don't do.

501
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,920
The after, nobody ever, I don't think people celebrate

502
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,680
the natural human bodily function of vomiting enough.

503
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah.

504
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
And I think that you could just like turn around and be like, what was that?

505
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,320
Am I right?

506
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,800
Or just turn around like 10 out of 10.

507
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,880
Could you lean into what was that as though it's never happened to you before?

508
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,320
Like you really didn't know that that was one of the holes where that thing happened.

509
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,440
What could that have been?

510
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Oh, that's good because you can get the build up and the after of like,

511
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
what is this feeling?

512
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
It would be amazing if it could be a payoff.

513
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Like in every conversation you're in the party before,

514
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,200
you find a way to work it around to the fact that you don't think vomiting exists.

515
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
And then when you do, it's like, oh my God, my eyes have been opened.

516
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,560
This is astounding.

517
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,280
Chuck was claiming he vomited earlier.

518
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
Fuck that guy.

519
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
What is he, a Tex Avery cartoon?

520
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,720
Come on.

521
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Here's what I think you do.

522
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,040
Because if it's something that's happening to you because you party a little bit too hard,

523
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,280
and I get very nauseous when I drink.

524
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,040
I know it's like, I think if you know you're about to go somewhere

525
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
where you're about to really party already,

526
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,040
then you tuck a small key in between your gums and your cheek.

527
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
And you put a little handcuff key in there.

528
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,040
And then when you yards, you let the key come out of the mouth and you get it.

529
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,880
And you hold it up and you say,

530
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,080
oh, thank God I've got to go.

531
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
And you run out of the house.

532
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,160
Oh, that's good.

533
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,080
What they don't know is you've eaten a bunch of handkerchiefs earlier.

534
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,880
When you vomit, you just start pulling them out and then say, ta-da.

535
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
You fish yourself out of your pocket.

536
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
And you say, you pull out your ear and you go,

537
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
Susan, I found it.

538
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
I'm on my way.

539
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,080
Or you throw up an engagement ring and then immediately get down on one knee to whoever

540
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,480
you're next to.

541
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,200
Just whoever.

542
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
Whoever's closest.

543
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,160
Because they're going to say no because you're a big vomit boy.

544
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,440
But at least it looks like you staged an elaborate proposal and then you got shut down.

545
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
So now you're going to get a little bit pity,

546
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
not for the vomiting, but probably also for the vomiting.

547
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,160
Okay, so you don't propose.

548
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Maybe you just get the ring and just like, oh, this is embarrassing.

549
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay, this was not supposed to go like this.

550
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I had a whole Bruno Mars song queued up and everything.

551
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,640
Okay, this is embarrassing.

552
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,800
Recently, my girlfriend was asked by her best friend to be her maid of honor at her upcoming

553
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,440
wedding.

554
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,600
She asked her by presenting my girlfriend with a bottle of wine that had a customized

555
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,920
label printed on it that said, will you be my maid of honor?

556
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,040
My girlfriend, of course, said yes, and life is good.

557
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,280
However, my question is, should we drink the wine or are we supposed to leave the wine

558
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,640
inside as some sort of artifact to commemorate this special occasion?

559
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Would it be even more rude not to drink it?

560
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,040
And that's from Not Drunk Enough Yet in New Jersey.

561
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,000
My in-laws threw me and some of Rachel's friends from St.

562
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,880
Louis who went to visit and they threw us a surprise baby shower there and somebody

563
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
brought little It's a Boy lollies and I was like, fuck yeah.

564
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,360
I took one, unwrapped it, popped it right in my gob.

565
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,640
Didn't even think twice.

566
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
Didn't even think twice about how this would be a treasured little artifact.

567
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
I just like, oh, cool.

568
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,600
It's a blow pop.

569
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,080
Considering you're a co-host of a podcast with a man who at the age of 12 ate his own

570
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,960
It's a Boy cigar from his birth, his bubble gum cigar from his birth, then I think you're

571
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,080
in fine company here.

572
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,160
It's a genetic trait of, I guess just to define that trait, we're shitheads.

573
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
Just shitheads who love gum.

574
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,800
Judging from your tone and your username, it sounds like we're really talking about

575
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,840
time frame here.

576
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,240
It does not sound, it's gonna happen, right?

577
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
Like they're gonna crack it open.

578
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,360
And the problem is the longer you wait, the guiltier you'll feel.

579
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
If you did it like the day you got it like, oh, that's nice, pop.

580
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,960
Like, okay.

581
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
But now you're building up momentum of not having opened it yet.

582
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,000
So the moment when you open it will have to be this like, this is the moment, like here

583
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,240
now.

584
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,920
Also the longer you let it sit in there, the better it tastes.

585
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,480
Well, I'm gonna bet that a lot of work went into the custom sweet awesome label.

586
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,400
I doubt very much that they slapped that custom label on like a $300 bottle of wine.

587
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah, it seems to me that if you get someone a bottle of wine that deserves to be celebrated,

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
you probably don't cover up the label.

589
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,800
I've won quite a few murder mysteries at Ravenswood Castle with the Shadow Stalkers group out

590
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,040
there.

591
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,600
And when they commemorate the victory, they give you a bottle of wine.

592
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,400
I have several of these.

593
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,520
And every time they give it to you, they say, now don't drink this wine because it's terrible.

594
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,640
It's like, oh, that's good.

595
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,680
That's good to know.

596
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,280
It's technically cooking wine.

597
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
It's basically, yeah.

598
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
Do you like vinegar?

599
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
Um, I think.

600
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,320
I think you do.

601
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
I do think you drink it though.

602
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,680
Yeah, I think you gotta save the bottle.

603
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,600
Maybe you could turn into like a vase or put some like colored sand.

604
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
That's a good question though, Trav.

605
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
Because you are opening up yourself up to a second question of like, what do I do with

606
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
this empty bottle with a label on it?

607
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,120
There's so many art projects you could do.

608
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah, man.

609
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,720
You make old sand art.

610
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,520
You could turn into like a fun puppet or something.

611
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
You could turn into action figure for the kids.

612
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,880
Just put a little ping pong ball on the top and you draw a cool face on it.

613
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,360
And you just like tape a gun onto it or something like that.

614
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,200
And it's like an army man.

615
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,640
If you're going to keep it as a souvenir, regardless, I think what you got to ask yourself

616
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,080
is what looks nicer?

617
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,560
Like a full bottle of wine or an empty bottle of wine?

618
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,800
I think you could probably sleep a bit easier knowing that you have a full bottle of wine

619
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,160
in the house at all times.

620
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,000
Like don't tuck into it.

621
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,360
Your emergency bottle?

622
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah, exactly.

623
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
It's better to know it's there and you don't have to use it.

624
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Well, and also, unless they're into like glass blowing, they didn't make the bottle.

625
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
Like the label is what matters.

626
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,640
And you could like steam that shit off there.

627
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah, steam it off and make a little brooch out of it.

628
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Or slap that in like a wedding scrapbook.

629
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
Slap it in a scrapbook, make it out and make it into a necklace or something.

630
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
Do something fun with it.

631
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,480
Put it on something you're never going to finish, like a bottle of vegetable oil.

632
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,960
I've had the same one in my cupboard for like five years.

633
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
Never been tempted to drink it.

634
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Not even once.

635
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,560
I got an old bottle of vinaigrette.

636
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,480
I could put that shit on, you know what I mean?

637
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,120
No problem.

638
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,320
Why didn't they just give you a big old can of vinegar?

639
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,240
You just say, why would you do this to me?

640
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,280
Why would you tempt me?

641
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
You know this is my favorite fluid, is wine.

642
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
Why wouldn't you put it on a big box of baking soda

643
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,640
and just stick it in my fridge for the rest of my life?

644
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,080
Why wouldn't you just etch it into like a tombstone if you wanted it to be forever?

645
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
Here's a tombstone.

646
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,080
Will you be my bridesmaid?

647
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,480
Thank you.

648
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,560
This is not a threat.

649
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,000
That's all etched on this.

650
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
Will you be my, this is a tombstone.

651
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,640
Will you be my bridesmaid?

652
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,680
This is not a threat.

653
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,800
I love you so much.

654
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,360
I love you.

655
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,120
There are people living in untouched like rainforest villages

656
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,600
that have not seen the slightest glimmer

657
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
of what we consider to be modern civilization in their entire history

658
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,560
who I think I would have more in common with

659
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,800
than a person who would take the time to create a beautiful gift

660
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,560
to ask someone to be their maid of honor.

661
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,560
I just want to take my hat off

662
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,640
because I don't know where you're finding the hours in the day.

663
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
I would like a few of them,

664
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
but that's a very thoughtful friend right there.

665
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,080
I cannot fathom it.

666
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
How would you do it, Justin?

667
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,720
I just fucking ask if I remember to ask.

668
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
Like if they show up and like,

669
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,400
oh fuck, you, will you be my maid of honor?

670
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
You're in charge now.

671
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,400
You're in charge now.

672
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,360
I can't do this no more.

673
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,480
I, when I did it, I created a fancy label

674
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,400
for different products

675
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,600
that I knew the recipient would be so tempted by

676
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,920
that they would have to tuck into them.

677
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,360
Um, so Justin, what did I send you?

678
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,120
I think it was a bag.

679
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,680
I think it was like an unopened bag of Tastations.

680
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, an unopened vintage bag of Tastations.

681
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,120
I bought on eBay and I had sealed it with the label

682
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
that said you're my brother and I love you

683
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
and will you please be involved in this special day?

684
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,000
Please don't tear the label up to get to the Tastations event.

685
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,840
And then I knew on my wedding day,

686
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,280
I made you show me the bag.

687
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,720
And it was, you were like, what bag?

688
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,440
What Tastations?

689
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,160
What bag?

690
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,440
I ate the bag.

691
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,560
You sent me a can of pizza-licious Pringles

692
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,440
that you had actually just masking taped the lid down

693
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,000
but had written on the masking tape,

694
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,320
will you be in my wedding party?

695
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,520
Don't break this seal.

696
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,040
Don't open, don't pop, don't stop.

697
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,160
Do stop, don't pop.

698
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
And that's why I didn't show up at your wedding.

699
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,200
That's exactly right.

700
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,160
I felt so guilty because I popped and I didn't stop.

701
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,600
Travis didn't show up because he didn't even realize

702
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,320
it was an invitation.

703
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,880
That's how quickly he ripped into those bad boys.

704
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,720
I just consimmed it like a cartoon character.

705
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
I put the whole can in my mouth

706
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
and then pulled that empty can back out.

707
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,400
For Evan, I just put the label over an Al Jarreau CD.

708
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
All of you failed me.

709
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,200
A rare one.

710
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,040
Should we go to the Money Zone?

711
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,920
We're already there.

712
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,400
Look around.

713
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,200
Away we go.

714
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:13,040
My Brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by Casper,

715
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,560
an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered

716
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,440
mattresses for a fraction of the price

717
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
that you're going to pay in a store.

718
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,040
Travis, you sleep on a Casper.

719
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,920
How's it going?

720
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,480
It's going so good.

721
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
Because Casper sent us an email like,

722
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,440
who wants to try out a Casper?

723
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,480
And Travis is like, me.

724
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,120
I do.

725
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
I want it up bed.

726
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,160
I'm actually eyeballing it right now,

727
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,400
waiting for the time when this stupid show is done

728
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,360
so I can take a nap.

729
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,520
And it's going to be so good.

730
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Like, listen, it's good for night sleeping,

731
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,600
but it's so good for day sleeping.

732
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
It's the best nap dress I've ever had.

733
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,320
What's so good about it?

734
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,080
It's great.

735
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,960
It's like a cloud.

736
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,160
You know, I've slept on mattresses before

737
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,640
that had like really uncomfortable springs in it

738
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,960
and, you know, just couldn't seem to find a balance

739
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
between like too soft and too firm.

740
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,800
And it just, all in all, like every mattress seemed like

741
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,280
it was just trying too hard to win my favor.

742
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,960
And Casper is not trying too hard.

743
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,840
It just is.

744
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,400
You know what I mean?

745
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,280
It's just, it's so confident in itself.

746
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
It's not trying to be what I want it to be.

747
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,720
It's just being what it is.

748
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,560
What I like about Casper, and I'll say it

749
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,240
because it's taken too long.

750
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,080
It has a risk-free trial and return policy.

751
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,680
You can sleep on it for a hundo days.

752
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,800
That's 100.

753
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
And they give free delivery to the US and Canada.

754
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,760
They have painless returns.

755
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,320
You don't like it?

756
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,440
You just send it right back.

757
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
And all the mattresses are made in America,

758
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,240
and that's what I really like about it.

759
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
Yeah, they're really great.

760
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
How can people get their hands on one of these Trisses?

761
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,160

One thing about me undies,

777
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,080
just got a new batch in the mail yesterday.

778
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,800
Jungle print.

779
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
You got them jungle print?

780
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I got them jungle print on my loins too.

781
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah, I put them on.

782
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,240
I was like, where my dick go?

783
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,600
And I was like, no, just kidding.

784
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,080
There it is.

785
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
And it looks fantastic.

786
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,040
It changed my loins to lions.

787
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,360
Me undies is so good.

788
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,320
It's seriously the best.

789
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,960
They're made of this tight micromodal fabric

790
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
and which is sustainably sourced.

791
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,320
It's twice as soft as cotton.

792
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,680
It's indescribably comfortable.

793
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,760
Once you try them on, you'll know why we call them

794
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,040
the world's most comfortable underwear,

795
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
why the world calls them that.

796
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
And if you don't love your first pair, they're free.

797
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,280
No questions asked.

798
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,880
They won't be like, oh, really?

799
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,200
Show them to me on your body now.

800
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,160
How long have you worn?

801
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,880
No, none of that.

802
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,120
They won't send out the goon squad.

803
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,440
They got dozens of styles, limited edition prints

804
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,360
to help you make a statement with your loins,

805
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,920
whether anyone can see them or not.

806
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
But you'll know, and that's what's important.

807
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,280
Shipping's free here in the US and Canada.

808
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
You can save up to eight bucks a pair

809
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,920
with the Me Undies subscription plan.

810
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,120
You can get either one of those for 20% off your first order

811
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,280

812
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,520
That's meundies.com slash my brother,

813
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,920
20% off your first order, meundies.com slash my brother.

814
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,040
I've got a message here for Chris from Cody.

815
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,000
This is a personal Yumbotron message,

816
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,480
which is what I'm calling Jumbotrons from now on

817
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,440
because they're so yummy.

818
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,600
After playing you the McElroy family fun hour episode,

819
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,400
I was a bit disappointed when you didn't seem too entertained.

820
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
But on my birthday, but on my birthday,

821
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
when you made a special trip to pick us up a bag

822
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,760
of Totino's cheddar blasted pizza rolls,

823
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,280
I had to let the McElroy brothers

824
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
and all the listeners know how much I love you

825
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,440
and how lucky I am to be your husband.

826
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
That's nice.

827
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,200
I'm sorry that Chris was not immediately floored

828
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,400
by our antics, but I'm glad that our viral marketing

829
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,240
wormed its way into his brain.

830
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah, those flavor biases shits is no joke.

831
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,440
How do they get so many flavors and so much of them on it?

832
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
It's, I can't tell.

833
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,200
I think it goes a little something like this.

834
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
I have another message here.

835
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,760
This one's for Air Bear and it's from Meglett who says,

836
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
oh, oh, they want us to sing.

837
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
You can do this.

838
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,680
Okay, it's a Hamilton thing.

839
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,400
I know my sister like I know my own mind.

840
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,680
You will never find bigger Bim Bam fans than she and I.

841
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,760
That was really good.

842
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,320
That was good.

843
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
Can you do the whole thing or?

844
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,200
If I tell her that I love him,

845
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,360
she'd be residedly resigned.

846
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,960
No, I meant the whole Jumbotron message.

847
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,640
The whole Jumbotron, you dummy.

848
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,800
Oh, I thought you meant the rest of the song.

849
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,320
I could do that.

850
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,080
That was straight off the dome, by the way.

851
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,560
That was really good.

852
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,000
Not even looking at the lyrics page.

853
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,680
I said, oh, Aaron, you're as beautiful and wise as CJ Craig.

854
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,760
She would definitely be friends with you, IRL,

855
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,440
as would Lin-Manuel Miranda.

856
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Happy his birthday from your baby sister.

857
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,080
May your zone be full of adventure in your 30th year.

858
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
We'd never received that much direction.

859
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,400
That's a lot of direction.

860
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,080
I felt a little hemmed in.

861
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,800
I wasn't able to do my freeform, you know, my comedy.

862
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,680
A lot of handling.

863
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
Yeah, a lot of handling going on.

864
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,600
A lot of handling, a lot of navigation.

865
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,320
Manhandling, I'd say.

866
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,280
A dan handling.

867
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
A lot of flan handling.

868
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,640
Is this what we're doing?

869
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm Allegra Ringo.

870
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
And I'm Renee Colbert.

871
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,520
And we host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

872
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
Renee, can I tell you about a dog I met this week?

873
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,560
I wish that you would.

874
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,120
In turn, though, can I tell you about a dog hero?

875
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,800
May I tell you about a dog breed in a segment I like to call Mutt Minute?

876
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,920
I would love that.

877
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
Could we maybe talk about some dog tech?

878
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,440
Could we have some cool guests on, like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Nicole Byer,

879
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,240
and Ann Wheaton?

880
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,320
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

881
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm in.

882
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,360
You're on board.

883
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,480
What do you say we do all of this and put it into a podcast?

884
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,040
Yeah, OK.

885
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,760
You think?

886
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,320
Perfect.

887
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,120
Should we call it, like, I don't know, Can I Pet Your Dog?

888
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,600
Sure.

889
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,000
All right.

890
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,840
What do you say we put it on every Tuesday on Maximum Fun?

891
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,960
Or on iTunes?

892
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,840
Sounds good to me.

893
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Meeting's over.

894
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,120
Do you want a Yahoo?

895
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,620
Yeah.

896
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,240
Do you guys want to get political or nah?

897
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,480
Yeah.

898
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah.

899
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,720
So sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

900
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,920
Or riding high.

901
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,600
Think Zoe Kinski's riding high at this point.

902
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gator who asks,

903
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
is Mayor McChee's a Republican or a Democrat?

904
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,660
Oh.

905
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,320
No, no additional information.

906
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,680
Elocuted or required?

907
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,440
Or desired?

908
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,120
Well, let's look at his policies.

909
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,960
I think that'll give us a clear indication.

910
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,760
Yeah.

911
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
He's for flavor.

912
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,000
Loves it.

913
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,040
Loves the shit.

914
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,720
But he's anti same sex marriage.

915
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,680
OK?

916
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,800
OK.

917
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,960
So now I think that's I think now I think he's definitely for flavor.

918
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,400
I think just like I don't think he's anti same sex marriage, right?

919
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,080
Because they're all fry guys, right?

920
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,000
What it really comes down to is is he pro grimace and bird person marriage?

921
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,060
Yeah.

922
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
That's the new frontier.

923
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,160
He loves flavor.

924
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,600
Let's just really focus on that.

925
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,880
He's very pro flavor.

926
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,440
We can all agree on that.

927
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
His head is a his head is a hand.

928
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,120
Like, let's not be let's not make fun here.

929
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,800
His head's a fucking hamburger.

930
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
And we know that.

931
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,480
Right.

932
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,640
I think he's got to be he's got to be tough on crime, right?

933
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Because I think if the hamburger ever tried to steal his head,

934
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,720
which would kill him like that's a crime he doesn't want to happen.

935
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,080
So he's got to be tough on crime.

936
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,680
He's he's a living hamburger man who resigned over a world based around

937
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,120
the selling and consuming of hamburgers.

938
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Well, I do want to get in here, Travis, and just correct you very quickly

939
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
and that he's not necessarily a hamburger man, but his head is a hamburger.

940
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
He definitely has a human body but a hamburger.

941
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
Like, yeah, half hamburger, half man.

942
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,800
He's a man burger.

943
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,080
But this man burger is selling baby burgers to the public to consume.

944
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,440
So is a man burger.

945
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,440
That means that a guy fucked a burger and I'm gonna go ahead

946
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:10,640
and put wimpy on blast here from Popeye definitely is is is Mayor McCheese's dad.

947
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm just saying that with his like cannibalistic like lifestyle,

948
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,720
I feel like we could-

949
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
I don't think he eats burgers, does he?

950
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,040
But he but he like he wants those babies to be eaten.

951
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,760
I feel like we could launch a very successful campaign against Mayor McCheese

952
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,000
if we wanted like a coup to replace Mayor McCheese as the like mayor of Hamburger Town

953
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,920
or whatever it's called, McDonaldland.

954
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,240
Speaking of McDonaldland, I wanted to take a quick break

955
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,960
to look at the Wikipedia page for McDonaldland.

956
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,760
I want to tell you guys about the Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald.

957
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,960
This is a videotape series released from 1998 to 2001 by Rugrats creators, Klaski Supo.

958
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,800
I remember these tapes.

959
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,040
Uh, the series depicted Ronald, Grimace, Birdie, the Hamburglar,

960
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,120
and here's where we start to lose the plot a little bit.

961
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,400
A few new characters like Ronald's pessimistic dog, Sunday.

962
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, hold on.

963
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,280
Wait, what?

964
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,240
Why would your dog-

965
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,200
How could you-

966
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
How could you live-

967
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,400
Okay, you're a puppy named Sunday who lives in a place called McDonaldland

968
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,520
and you're pessimistic?

969
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,080
Surrounding us.

970
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,800
How dare you?

971
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
I don't know, Ronald.

972
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,080
Even real living dogs in the Earth realm,

973
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,280
not in the Dark realm where Mc- where Hamburgerland takes place.

974
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
Not in the Upside Down.

975
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,680
Not in the Upside Down.

976
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,040
Fucking real dogs are not pessimistic unless they used to be Kevin Spacey

977
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,840
and they got transformed by magic and are having a hard time finding their way home.

978
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,000
Pessimistic is not a characteristic I've ever heard attributed to a dog.

979
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,640
Yeah, my dog's one of those real, real, uh, uh,

980
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,960
feeding dish half empty types of mutts.

981
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,680
These videos would begin in live action

982
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,720
in what resembled a futuristic McDonaldland.

983
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,280
Fuck that.

984
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Then the characters would enter a tube or other means of travel.

985
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,800
They would become animated.

986
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,240
Hey, ClaskeySuba, I think you might be trying a little bit too hard.

987
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,920
Seems like maybe the pre-production phase went on a little bit too long for this series.

988
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,480
Maybe you should just, like, chill out a little bit.

989
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,760
How much premise do you need for your animated series about McDonalds?

990
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
How much grimace premise do you need?

991
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm pretty sure people already bought into the McDonald's brand enough

992
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,400
that you didn't have to say, like, hey, you guys, let's really sell them on this cartoon.

993
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,320
You guys realize they haven't been McDonaldland commercials since 2004?

994
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,120
Isn't that weird?

995
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,400
Doesn't it seem like they're still around?

996
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,200
No, dog.

997
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,320
I want to be the first to update this article

998
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,000
because the last section covers the last 11 years of history

999
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,760
and it says that they've been phased out,

1000
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,440
but the McDonaldland characters continue to appear at McDonald's play areas,

1001
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,240
decorative seats for children's birthday parties, and bibs.

1002
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,280
The only Ronald McDonald, Bertie, Grimace, and Hamburglar appear in them.

1003
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,480
They also appear in some soft drink cups until 2008.

1004
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,120
They do, however, still appear as cookies in pouches,

1005
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,200
respectfully titled McDonaldland Cookies.

1006
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,760
As of today, the characters-

1007
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,260
Rawr, rawr.

1008
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,520
They're still burning through the same McDonaldland cookies that they made in 2002.

1009
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,480
Guaranteed, absolutely.

1010
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,680
As of today, the characters appear on the windows of some McDonald's restaurants.

1011
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Modern commercials nowadays usually depict Ronald McDonald alone in real world situations.

1012
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
So lonely, so all alone.

1013
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,920
So alone, exiled from his land,

1014
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
whether he visits a local restaurant

1015
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,680
or goes to visit sick children at a Ronald McDonald house.

1016
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,000
So like, I want to be the person who's like,

1017
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,640
oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, park, park, park, pull over, pull over.

1018
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,360
Check that window.

1019
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,440
That's a grimace.

1020
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm putting this on Wikipedia.

1021
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah, we found him.

1022
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,000
We found him.

1023
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,200
That's another spot spotting.

1024
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,280
Is Mayor McCheese, is his first name Mayor?

1025
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,600
Does he actually have the title of Mayor or is his name just Mayor?

1026
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,320
I mean, but I'm looking, I've been doing some deep white googling

1027
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,160
and character description,

1028
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,400
Mayor of McDonaldland, the cheesiest burger in town.

1029
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,360
Is that how he got elected?

1030
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,960
Was there no like, proper vote?

1031
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,160
There's like, who's the cheesiest burger?

1032
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,400
Is this Ed Wynn-sounding motherfucker?

1033
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
According to the same Wiki that Justin and I are now the only two active users on

1034
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,640
in the whole internet,

1035
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,080
he's portrayed as a giggly, bumbling, and somewhat incompetent mayor.

1036
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,400
Well.

1037
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,640
Based on H.R. Puff and stuff,

1038
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,240
while the character was dropped during the streamlining of characters in the mid-80s.

1039
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,600
He died. He did die, I guess.

1040
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,560
He died.

1041
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,760
I guess he did die.

1042
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,680
I have a hard time picking out his affiliation here,

1043
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,760
but I feel like libertarian.

1044
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,720
That would be my, yeah, that would be my thinking.

1045
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,200
Oh, I'm actually looking here.

1046
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,560
It says Bull Moose Party.

1047
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm basing that on almost nothing,

1048
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,120
but I imagine like, people would come to him and be like,

1049
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,440
Mayor McCheese, what are the laws?

1050
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,880
It's fucking chaos out here.

1051
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,320
Nobody's telling anybody what to do.

1052
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
And he's like, yep, exactly.

1053
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,280
And he like picks off one of his own sesame seeds and eats it.

1054
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,600
No gods, no kings, only food.

1055
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,720
No, says the man in Burger King.

1056
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,480
Does the sweat of my pickle belong to the bourgeoisie?

1057
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,200
Is the grease of my own bun on it?

1058
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,840
No, says Dave Thomas.

1059
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,320
No, says Long John Silver.

1060
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,880
No, says the man behind Captain D's, whose name I don't know.

1061
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,960
It probably starts with a D.

1062
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,880
It probably starts with a D, he's probably a captain.

1063
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,880
It seems your cup of Sprite has gone empty.

1064
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,440
You can refill it at the Fountainhead.

1065
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,720
Welcome to my play place.

1066
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,700
Stupid.

1067
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
This is a dumb fucking podcast.

1068
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,000
It's a dumb podcast.

1069
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,520
Hey brothers, I have a query, which I could use a little help with.

1070
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,320
My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost a year now and are talking about moving in together.

1071
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,240
One problem, he lives out of his car.

1072
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,240
Which has been cool.

1073
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,080
I just think of what his head sounds like.

1074
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,440
Because if you think about it, he's had a one hamburger, anyway.

1075
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
It's gotta be bad.

1076
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,240
Oh, you're talking about the Mayor McCheese.

1077
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,440
Mayor McCheese, one problem.

1078
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,480
Okay, let me start over.

1079
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,120
Not this man who lives in, I thought you were saying this person who lives in his car.

1080
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,600
No, Mayor McCheese's head, it's gotta be rough by now.

1081
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,760
I've been dating Mayor McCheese for about a year now.

1082
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,320
He lives out of his car, he hasn't had much work lately.

1083
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,880
Hey brothers, I have a query, which I could use a little help with.

1084
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,680
My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost a year now and are talking about moving in together.

1085
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
One problem, he lives out of his car.

1086
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,280
Which has been cool, I have my own place too.

1087
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,800
But the closer my lease is to ending, the more I notice when we talk about living together,

1088
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,680
the conversation sometimes ends up being about which van would be easiest for two people to live in.

1089
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,560
While I'm all for reducing my environmental impact, I was kind of hoping, what?

1090
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,840
It's a van?

1091
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,440
Sorry, go ahead, but it is a van.

1092
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,400
It is a van.

1093
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,000
My house is cool because it doesn't consume gasoline to go.

1094
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
I was kind of hoping to live somewhere with a toilet.

1095
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,480
So how do I tell him we're not living in a car without squashing his sense of freedom?

1096
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,400
That's from cramped in California.

1097
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,600
I don't, okay, so this is going to be a real tough one because I don't want to,

1098
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,960
I don't want to harsh anybody's mellow.

1099
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,640
I don't want, if this is his lifestyle and he's like into it, I don't get it personally.

1100
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,680
But, but there, okay, but there's, there's, there's some room here to discuss

1101
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,560
because the thing is, it's like compromise and like a little bit of giving 60-40,

1102
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,400
as Justin has talked about before.

1103
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,120
It's very important here because I feel like there is a,

1104
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,680
there is a middle ground between living in a car and living in like a three bedroom, two bathroom.

1105
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:24,560
Like-

1106
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,400
You know what that ground, you know what that ground is called?

1107
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,440
It's tiny house.

1108
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,040
Tiny home movement.

1109
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,200
I'm saying you could do tiny house that has a bathroom, has a toilet, has a tiny kitchen.

1110
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,520
Like feels like a tiny, it's not for me, God knows.

1111
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,600
But like this, or, or like a studio apartment even where it's like-

1112
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,840
Oh no, even better, even better.

1113
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,360
There's a new HDTV show because of course there's an HDTV show

1114
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,840
about literally any kind of container in which you can store yourself

1115
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,680
and your things and your loved ones.

1116
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,600
And there's one about houses that are also boats and I think it's called Boat Home.

1117
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,520
Yeah, you could be on Boat Home.

1118
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,240
You could be on Boat Home in a boat home, dude.

1119
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,600
Boat Home, Alabama.

1120
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,560
What if you tell him you want to do a tiny home and he decides to be a smart ass

1121
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,960
and you just come up one day and he's just taking the wheels off?

1122
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,640
Like there, mission accomplished.

1123
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,760
We live in a tiny home.

1124
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,040
No, because there are certain things that make a home and it's love and a bathroom.

1125
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,760
Me and my significant other, we celebrate the big car movement.

1126
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,040
It's better than a small car to live in, but Jesus, not much.

1127
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,920
Boat Home, Boat Home.

1128
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,520
How great would it be to be in a boat home?

1129
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,600
You're just like in the docks in Baltimore.

1130
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,840
You're just like, I'm done with Baltimore.

1131
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,360
Unhook, bye.

1132
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,600
Well, there's the other side of that where you wake up in the morning like,

1133
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,280
oh shit, we forgot to tie off.

1134
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,920
I miss Baltimore.

1135
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,640
Hey guys, family meeting on the poop deck.

1136
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240
We don't live in Baltimore anymore.

1137
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,360
Neptune has decided for us.

1138
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,040
That's really good because if you need a toilet, it's right there.

1139
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,160
It's called the ocean.

1140
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,360
It's called the ocean.

1141
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,720
You just pop that, pop open the hole in the bottom of the boat.

1142
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,640
Oh no, our belongings.

1143
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,160
Why do birds have toilets?

1144
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah.

1145
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,840
Think about it.

1146
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,720
Yeah, I know.

1147
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,240
It's our pride, man.

1148
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,840
If you guys could have a boat home, what would it be?

1149
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,440
A full yacht home?

1150
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,400
Are you kidding me?

1151
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,040
Oh no, that's too, let's set a reasonable budget.

1152
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,680
Oh, okay.

1153
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,640
Well, you didn't-

1154
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,840
$150.

1155
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,400
I would want to live on a super massive boat that's 100 miles long.

1156
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,360
No, Trav.

1157
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,440
Okay, if I can't do pirate boat home.

1158
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,680
No.

1159
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,680
I would like to do, I'd like to go the other way then and do full like

1160
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,960
big river Tom Sawyer, just like a raft home.

1161
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
Oh, no roof, just right?

1162
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,280
Just me just out there with my friend Jim.

1163
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,080
Just looking up at the stars.

1164
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,280
And probably really hungry because we don't have a refrigerator or any way to store food.

1165
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,800
We don't have a toilet or anything, yeah.

1166
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:01,840
Could I just do, could I just get an RV and attach some really good balloons to it

1167
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,680
and just float that shit?

1168
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,640
Like Lazy Up?

1169
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,680
Yeah.

1170
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,400
Just float that RV.

1171
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,720
Up to open ocean?

1172
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,320
Up to with fewer balloons because the first one stressed me out.

1173
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,200
I remember watching Up one just going like, oh, God, that's a lot of balloons.

1174
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,040
Are there going to be that many the whole time?

1175
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,520
Shit.

1176
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,400
Wait, it was the sheer number of balloons bothering you?

1177
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,320
Did you see, do you remember watching Up and like when the house first opens up

1178
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,200
and you're like, oh, he's going to float the house on some balloons.

1179
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,000
But then there's like a million fucking balloons and you're just like, oh, man,

1180
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
that's way too many balloons to even look at.

1181
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,080
I don't know what you mean.

1182
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,920
Did you see the fucking movie?

1183
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,400
Yeah.

1184
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,880
Yeah.

1185
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,560
A lot of people stopped watching it after that very sad intro that you had to pay your

1186
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,320
tears tax for, but then you get, so a lot of people quit and they don't even know how

1187
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,000
many fucking balloons there were that popped out of that house, but there were so many

1188
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,840
and I just, I tried, I looked at them and I tried to count all of them and I was like,

1189
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,280
this is a fool's errand.

1190
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,160
Because there were too many balloons.

1191
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
So many balloons, it just got me so anxious.

1192
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,360
You know what I'm talking about?

1193
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,880
Right?

1194
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,200
Yeah.

1195
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,560
Balloons would start popping during that movie and like would fall out off the house and

1196
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,600
I'd be like, oh, thank God, more balloons that I don't have to worry about.

1197
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,960
But when they had the maximum number of balloons right there at like sort of like 25 minutes

1198
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,360
into the movie, I was like, fuck, that's way too many, way too many balloons.

1199
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:35,840
I don't want to live on a historic boat that we get some people coming by to like check

1200
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,160
it out.

1201
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,480
What about a ferry that's in operation?

1202
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,520
So every day you just have thousands of visitors.

1203
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,000
Welcome to my ferry.

1204
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,400
Would you like to play a video game with me?

1205
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,520
Oh, that's nice.

1206
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,080
We could play like some euchre, you know, just like it's so nice to have visitors.

1207
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,480
Please take your shoes off on the ferry.

1208
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,920
I would like to live on some kind of boat that no one believes that a human being should

1209
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,640
be living on.

1210
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,560
Like what, Travis?

1211
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,120
I don't know.

1212
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,600
Like maybe like one of those submarines that they use in planet Earth to go down and look

1213
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,520
at like the stuff way, way down there.

1214
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,680
And it's just big enough for like one and a half people.

1215
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,960
And it's got tiny portals.

1216
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,840
I would like for that to be my it's like a tiny boat home movement.

1217
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,960
That's what I'm going for.

1218
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,200
We're getting away from the point.

1219
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,800
Should this person live in their significant other's car?

1220
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,040
No.

1221
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,040
Who's fan are they going to live in?

1222
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,920
I mean, I really think tiny homes the way to go here.

1223
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,960
I watch them and I just think like that would be so great.

1224
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,320
I mean, it's not ideal for me.

1225
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,000
I don't know that I could stand it.

1226
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,760
But like, well, it's because you rip those cheesy blasters all the time, dog.

1227
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,680
You blow the doors off the motherfucker.

1228
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,240
Now, it's mostly that I would just be constantly like Harry and the Hendersons, like turning

1229
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,680
around and knocking stuff off of everything all the time.

1230
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,040
I do that now and I live in like a full sized home.

1231
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,880
I can't imagine how much chaos I would wreak upon a tiny home, but it would not be good.

1232
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,320
I would be like Alice in Alice in Wonderland, growing through with my arms and legs and

1233
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,760
head poking out the sides and top.

1234
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,800
Yeah, I love it.

1235
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,680
And then you get your tummy cut open, you're a cake the whole time.

1236
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,320
Exactly.

1237
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,440
I don't like the tiny homes where they've built an extensive outdoor area.

1238
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,560
It's like, hi, can you go home?

1239
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,600
You're cheating.

1240
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,160
Can you not?

1241
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,920
That's my home.

1242
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,000
That's part of my extended home, which is all outdoors.

1243
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,040
We have to share that.

1244
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,080
You can't claim it.

1245
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,480
I would like to have a tiny home that lives in the yard of my full sized home, and it's

1246
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,480
just like my retreat home just for me when I want to feel like a giant.

1247
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,120
Just the exact replica of your current home?

1248
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,680
Exactly the same, but like much smaller.

1249
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
What else would you have in your very tiny home, Travis?

1250
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,440
Tiny tables, tiny chairs, some tiny utensils.

1251
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,080
But they're all tiny to different scales.

1252
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,800
So the table is like for a mouse, but the chair is like for a dog.

1253
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,960
And it's like, well, this is just, come on.

1254
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,320
I don't want it to make sense.

1255
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,440
I want it to be like a tiny fun house, you know what I mean?

1256
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,720
And maybe one of the floors slanted, and it gets to feel like I'm in like a tiny mystery

1257
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,200
house.

1258
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,240
That's fun.

1259
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,840
Why aren't there tiny mystery houses?

1260
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,480
Why aren't there more?

1261
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:10,980
Why?

1262
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,960
Okay, why don't I have a house with a secret passage in it?

1263
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,800
Why don't any houses have secret passages?

1264
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,520
Well, yeah.

1265
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,680
Oh, you know what'd be great?

1266
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,760
A secret passage between your regular sized house and your tiny house so that when guests

1267
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,880
like fall asleep, you just push them through the secret passage and they wake up in the

1268
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,960
tiny house and they're like, what happened?

1269
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,000
That's good.

1270
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,760
I have a great fucking idea.

1271
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,680
Okay, I'm ready.

1272
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,480
You have to call the boyfriend's bluff by saying, oh, you want to live in a bigger vehicle?

1273
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,640
I was thinking we would simplify.

1274
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,520
I want to live with you, my darling love, on a horse, on a horse's back.

1275
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
That will be our home.

1276
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,960
That will be our home, an even smaller thing.

1277
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,440
It's going to be a big, it'll have a big saddle on it and we'll have some saddle bags where

1278
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,800
we'll keep one plate and one can of beans.

1279
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,120
That shall sustain us for the rest of our lives.

1280
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,640
That end our love on this, the back of a horse home.

1281
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Have you seen the new TV show Horse Home?

1282
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,800
It's extremely short.

1283
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,840
Each episode is like two minutes.

1284
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,680
And June Jonathan is just like, this seems like a good horse.

1285
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,240
Saddle up.

1286
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,080
And that's a home now.

1287
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,400
That's a good, have fun out there.

1288
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:28,880
Be safe.

1289
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,800
Do you want an umbrella or something?

1290
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,680
Cause you know, okay.

1291
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,840
Just the one can of beans.

1292
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,400
Okay.

1293
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,520
What's the horse going to eat?

1294
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,040
You don't, the horse won't eat.

1295
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,880
Yeah, I guess so.

1296
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,360
I'm not a horseologist, but I think they would love some of those beans.

1297
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,960
But folks, that's going to do it for us.

1298
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,080
We hope you have enjoyed yourself here on the My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast.

1299
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,440
We're sorry if some parts were dumb.

1300
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,720
We don't mean for it to be dumb.

1301
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,720
You know, we're just doing our best out here.

1302
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,840
We want to say thank you to, let's see, the maximum fun.org network.

1303
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,680
We don't always give them top billing, but I want to take a moment to thank them for

1304
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,320
all they've done for us and for having us on their network.

1305
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,400
They've got a brand new show called tights and fights.

1306
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,120
Hell yeah.

1307
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:19,120
If you are a fan of wrestling at all, you're really going to enjoy this show.

1308
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:27,040
It includes as hosts for starters, our dear friend, Hal, who is a very funny person and

1309
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,680
great to play overwatch with highly recommended there.

1310
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,800
It also includes Mike Eagle and Daniel Radford.

1311
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,120
So you'll want to look for that wherever fine podcasts are sold.

1312
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,800
Tyson fights is the name of that one.

1313
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,600
It's about wrestling.

1314
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,640
We also want to let you know our monikers game.

1315
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,680
I believe it's still going.

1316
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,040
How many more days do they have?

1317
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,360
A handful, a handful, a small poultry handful by the time there will not be another episode

1318
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,160
before it ends.

1319
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,640
There are literally two days left as you're listening to this.

1320
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,400
Do not sleep.

1321
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,120
If you've been waiting till the last minute, this is the last minute.

1322
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,520
Go to mackroycollection.com order that now because it's not going to be available.

1323
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,080
Once that pre-order is done, it's gone.

1324
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,360
I really want to hit this hard.

1325
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,280
We have no plans to sell it as a product after this pre-order.

1326
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,000
The only people that are going to get it are people that pre-order it.

1327
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,840
I hope we've made it explicitly clear because I will shout down anybody who I won't shout

1328
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,120
down, but you don't, don't wait until next week.

1329
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,760
And it's like, oh, I should get, you cannot get it at that point.

1330
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,560
It's only a pre-order.

1331
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,560
It's the only way that we know how to make as many as we need.

1332
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,200
A portion of all sales are going to go to grow Huntington, which is an organization

1333
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,520
here in our home city that is fighting addiction with urban farming.

1334
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,120
They actually just got their land and they are trying to get the money together to get

1335
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,280
this urban farm going for people who are in addiction recovery.

1336
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,360
It is, it is a great, great effort, and we hope to be able to support them a lot.

1337
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,800
And every time you buy a copy of our game at mackroycollection.com, you are helping

1338
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,360
to do that.

You can find more info on that group.

1340
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,880

1341
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,440
That's G-R-O Huntington dot org.

1342
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,440
The expansion is only ten dollars.

1343
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,120
Help support us.

1344
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,640
Help support Grow Huntington.

1345
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,280
And, you know, get a fun game for you and your friends to play together.

1346
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,720
mackroycollection.com.

1347
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,440
Do not wait.

1348
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,320
Go there now.

1349
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,000
We wouldn't do this if the game sucked.

1350
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,040
It's a fucking great game.

1351
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,760
We played all the time.

1352
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,120
OK, I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for using our theme song It's

1353
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,800
Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1354
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,880
We plug Max Fun.

1355
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,360
We have other podcasts that we do both on and off Max Fun.

1356
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,600
You can find all those at mackroyshows.com.

1357
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,280
You can also find out how to get in touch with us.

1358
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,360
I think Travis finally added my PO box info.

1359
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,160
I did.

1360
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,120
I did it.

1361
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,920
Speaking of other podcasts, I did want to give a quick plug for it.

1362
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,360
This is not a Max Fun show.

1363
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:41,040
But my cousin, Michael, and my father-in-law, Tommy, just started a new podcast called Court

1364
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,760
Appointed.

1365
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,440
Michael's a lawyer, and the show is sort of about pop culture and how it intersects with

1366
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,000
the law.

1367
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,520
And you will learn things, but you're also going to have a lot of fun.

1368
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,160
There's a lot of dad jokes, and it's a very funny podcast.

1369
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,800
And I think you will very much enjoy it.

1370
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,120
They are on iTunes.

1371
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,960
Just search for Court Appointed.

1372
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,480
The response to it has been really, really good.

1373
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,840
And I think you'll really like it.

1374
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,200
I think you'll really like it if you ever listen to Sawbones or Schmaners, which is

1375
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,920
sort of that historical kind of comedy podcast.

1376
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,640
I think you'll dig this.

1377
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,120
It's sort of a legal take on that sort of structure.

1378
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,760
I think you'll dig it.

1379
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,880
It's called Court Appointed.

1380
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,920
Check it totally out.

1381
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,880
I do a show with my friend, Tybee, called Interrobang.

1382
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,640
We are doing our first ever live show.

1383
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,800
Saturday the 13th is when the live show is.

1384
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,040
It's at the Three Clubs here in Los Angeles.

1385
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
Tickets are only $8 at the door.

1386
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,840
Come out.

1387
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,880
It's going to be a really great time.

1388
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,560
The show's at 730.

1389
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,200
So if you're in L.A. and you want to come out and either check out a new podcast or

1390
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,920
support a podcast you already like, the Three Clubs, 730, August 13th.

1391
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,800
Come see Interrobang live for the first time ever anywhere.

1392
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,000
Do you guys want that final?

1393
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:44,960
Yes, please.

1394
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,440
I'm ready.

1395
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,480
Here it comes.

1396
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,240
Sent in by level9000, Yaju Drew, Drew Davenport.

1397
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,800
Thank you, Drew.

1398
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,680
It's by YajuAnswersUser.

1399
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,160
J Money, 36, 116.

1400
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,720
J Money asks,

1401
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,240
What kind of apple juice comes in a small glass jar like the ones that were on the TV show, Martin?

1402
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1403
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1404
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1405
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,440
I know what he's talking about.

1406
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
Those shits was on Boy Meets World too.

1407
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,160
You look good.

1408
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,240
Beautiful little gloves and refreshment.

1409
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,840
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1410
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:33,440
You and my brother and my brother and me kiss your dad's grub on the lips.

1411
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,680
Maximumfun.org.

Listener-supported.

1415
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,120
Attention, you're up.
