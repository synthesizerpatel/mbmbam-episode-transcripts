1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your middlest brother, Travis, the middlest brother of McElroy.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
And I'm Griffin McElroy. Thanks for listening, folks.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,240
I want to join his- Hey, shut up. I want to talk about my thing.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,400
So fast. So furious.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Really quick. Guys, it's going to blow your mind,

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
and you're talking about other bullshit instead of the very important thing.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
Welcoming our guests to our house. I don't care about them.

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
Me and Justin have some fucking party snacks. We got some Ritz Crackers,

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,280
different savory delights on them, and you just ran in and flying bicycle kicks.

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Big bucket of Kool-Aid on them. That's because you guys are living

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,080
in the past, and once I tell you what I'm going to tell you about,

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,800
you won't remember what it's like before. And it is this.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,040
My friends just announced, big announcement, on the upcoming-

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
I already hear you laughing. I'm wondering if this is even true.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm wondering if you're even excited about what you're saying.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,440
On the, in the upcoming premiere of The Last Man Standing,

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,320
the Tim Allen sitcom, there will be a special guest

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,280
in which Tim the Toolman Taylor will meet Tim Allen's character in Last Man Standing.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,000
How does the mind boggles? How does he-

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
First of all, how are they going to film that? Fucking impossible.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
You can't. There's no way. Tell me everything.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,880
So, Tim the Toolman Taylor will meet Last Man Standing's Mike Baxter

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,840
in the Fox comedy Last Man Standing. I know absolutely nothing about it.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
This is just, this is recent news. The episode hasn't aired yet,

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
so we can only speculate at the implications. Yeah.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,960
And let me also just say, I've watched a lot of TV before.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,800
We made, of course, a hit award-winning television show

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,440
called My Brother, My Brother, Me. I didn't know you could just fucking do that.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah. I didn't know you could be like,

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,520
enjoy this new episode of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,560
where Chandler Bing shows up and hangs out with Matthew Perry.

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
That would have saved the show. It might have saved it.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
Right now, Matthew Perry is listening to this episode and going,

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
God damn it, why didn't we do that? That would have been real cool.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
I think I speak for all of America when I say,

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
I think I speak for all of America when I say, can they touch?

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,200
There's a screenshot, Griffin, accompanying the thing I saw,

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,960
where they're shaking hands. No, well, that's the problem.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,360
Is that if they do touch, I feel like they should,

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,760
I mean, any number of sort of cataclysmic things.

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,640
Oh, wait, sorry. Okay, now we're fucking cooking.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
I thought that's what you were getting at here.

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,160
If they could touch- Turn down the lights.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,360
I just want a sweet, tender, romantic love scene

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
between Tim Allen and Tim Allen. Oh, we all want that.

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,960
But why stop there? Because Tim Allen circa Santa Claus

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,600
could be up in there too. Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,160
It's a big Tim Allen. Three-way menage a Tim.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,800
That's pure Michigan, baby. And maybe get buzzed up in there.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,480
You didn't stop to listen to me saying that's pure Michigan, baby,

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
and I'm going to need you to just take a second, okay?

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
Okay, so let me do it again. That's pure Michigan, baby.

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,560
If we can just get buzzed sort of doing commentary,

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,320
like, yes, you're stroking his butt.

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
You're about to, you're putting your wiener near his butt

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
and beyond. You guys are going to sinfinity and beyond.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
That's better. It's pretty good.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
Cool, man. Cool. I'll watch that.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
No, sorry, Griffin. Tool, man.

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
Tool, man. Guess what? I'll fucking watch that.

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
I won't like it. I won't enjoy supporting Mr. Allen's art.

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,440
But damn it, he got me in his trap again.

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
You know what the first thing I thought of when I saw it, Griffin?

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
Can I say something real quick before we move off the sex thing?

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
I just want to say that it's not fair that home,

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,760
like in Home Improvement, doesn't rhyme with cum,

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,520
even though they're spelled the same way,

75
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
because I think there'll be a really good thing there.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah, there's something there.

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
A really good thing.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,080
Maybe the thing would just be cum improvement.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,760
Yeah, but that doesn't, you know what I mean?

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,080
I could have said that without any sort of setup

81
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
and it wouldn't have really landed.

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
Home Improvement doesn't, you know what I mean?

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,560
So here's the thing, Griffin, when I saw that announcement,

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,120
you mentioned- I don't think so, Tim.

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Oh, shit.

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
When I saw that announcement, I knew what we need.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,720
Oh, Jesus Christ.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,760
More power.

89
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,680
It just brings out the biggest fucking symbion

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
you've ever seen in your entire life.

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,840
All right.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
So Travis, you've been trying to save for the past four minutes.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
And Wilson peeks over and goes, I'm going to finish.

94
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm climaxing, neighbor.

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
When you see an announcement like this, Griffin,

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
you mentioned not liking Mr. Allen's art.

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,320
And all I can think is, it must be that a lot of people don't,

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,760
because this isn't the move you make

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,320
when your show is doing super good and successful, right?

100
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
I am actually pretty sure, Travis,

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,200
that Last Man Standing has been canceled,

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,240
which it means that they're just kind of going for it.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,000
This is the end.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
This is season nine.

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,480
How do we let this kind of thing happen?

106
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
You know what I mean?

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
How do we let this sort of thing happen?

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
Because the show was canceled in 2017.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,040
I thought I was having a weird Bear and St. Bear's thing

110
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,920
where I was like, wait.

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
We pointed our ire with a far too focused a lens

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
right toward Young Sheldon, and he deserved it.

113
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
But also at the same time, Tim was over there

114
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
doing something sneaky in the fucking corner, wasn't he?

115
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,880
Bringing it back without us looking.

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
What a stinker.

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Wait, is Young Sheldon,

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,840
the actor who plays Young Sheldon,

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,320
also like a right wing asshole?

120
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
We're just watching Young Sheldon

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
waiting for him to make a mistake.

122
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
Yeah, because once we do,

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,480
Bazinga.

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,320
Is there an episode of Young Sheldon

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,760
where he finds Bazinga?

126
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,120
Each season he gets one,

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
in season one it was Baz,

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
and I hear in season two they're working towards Ing.

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Mm-hmm, okay.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
So this has been a good intro.

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
When you mentioned breaking news,

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
I did think you were gonna talk about

133
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
the actual breaking news that just got announced

134
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,480
that they're doing breakdancing at the 2024 Olympics.

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
Wow, holy shit.

136
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,920
How hard am I legally allowed to watch the Olympics?

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,440
How hard am I allowed to watch that happen

138
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,480
and them do that?

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
They're in pay per view,

141
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,480
but I feel like this is maybe the moment.

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,760
I enjoy amateur's breakdancing.

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,880
I can't imagine how much I will enjoy

144
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,440
Olympic level professionals.

145
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,880
So I've got, what, probably three and a half years.

146
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Do you think I can get there?

147
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
Three and a half years.

148
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,080
Do you think I can get there?

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
I think you can, Griffin,

150
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,840
but I think it will be like, spoiler alert,

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
the wrestler where you'll do it and then die.

152
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,200
Wow, man, the spoilers don't come much worse than that,

153
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,840
do they?

154
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
I've never seen the wrestler.

156
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
I just know what happened

157
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,040
because other people have spoiled it for me.

158
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,560
They should call it the Dyer.

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah, they should call it the wrestler

160
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,720
and then he dies on it.

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
But man, wouldn't that be worth it?

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Actually, the actual title is wrestler,

163
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
parentheses, rip, in parentheses.

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
And they would lower the fucking,

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,520
well, let's be honest, I would be lucky to place,

166
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,880
but so let's say bronze medal just onto my dead-ass body,

167
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,240
slumped over the pedestal.

168
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
And you would still be all twisted up

169
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
from your last super cool move that you did?

170
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
Oh, I would definitely die a fucking

171
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
Auntie Anne's pretzel man, for sure.

172
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,760
Well, this is also an advice show, against all odds,

174
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
this is also an advice show,

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,280
and I'm ready to help people if you guys are,

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,200
unless you have any more great Tim Allen sex.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
What do you think Tim Allen breakdancing

178
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
at the Olympics looks like?

179
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
I think it would go a little something like this.

180
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,280
This is gonna get too esoteric.

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Maybe.

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
They're gonna have breakdance at the Olympics,

183
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
which means that they're gonna have to get judges

184
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,520
who are like experts in breakdancing,

185
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,560
but aren't at like a competitive level anymore.

186
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
And I bet that's gonna be hard to admit to yourself

187
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,840
because this is a new event

188
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,600
and you never got your moment right.

189
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Right, okay, I'm buying a fog machine for my band

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
when shows happen again.

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,560
This is the fucking perfect, supply and demand wise,

192
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
I bet fog machines you could get for a song.

193
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,920
Oh, absolutely.

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,520
This is a buyer's market for fog machines, 100%.

195
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,240
Why stop there?

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Get a disco ball, get one of those things

197
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,520
that's like got all the different lasers inside of it

198
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
and kind of spins around.

199
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,240
That's what they're called.

200
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
They need a name for those.

201
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
They gotta get a name for them though.

202
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
So I'm buying a fog machine for when shows happen again.

203
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm excited, but whenever I see a band

204
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,600
that has a fog machine, it's always super lame

205
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
when the band turns on the fog machine

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,960
and it slowly covers the stage.

207
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,520
How do I distract people before the show

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
when we are dispensing fog?

209
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
PS, we are a shoegaze band.

210
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
That's from Hazy and Haze.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Thank you, by the way.

212
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
These are the details we need, folks.

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Yes, yes.

214
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,440
Even if they don't make it into the podcast,

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
we need this information.

216
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
If only we knew what shoegaze was.

217
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
Shoegaze, that is the one stumbling block.

218
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
Maybe a sort of a sample,

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
because you know what we're about to do

220
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
is draw parallels to somebody we think is shoegaze

221
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
and then get mocked mercilessly on,

222
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
I was about to say Twitter,

223
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
but it'll probably happen on TikTok.

224
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Maybe it's Shoegaze.

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
Shoegaze.

226
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
A Shoegaze band.

227
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll tell you what's bad, you guys.

228
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,040
I looked it up after I read this question

229
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
and I have since forgotten.

230
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
My Bloody Valentine's a big one.

231
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
That's the one that keeps coming up.

232
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,320
Is it like when a band has really good shoes

233
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
and you can't stop looking at them?

234
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
No, I don't think that's probably it.

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
I think it's just kind of mopey, huh?

236
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Mopey tones, mopey tones.

237
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
Mopey tones.

238
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay, so your band, the mopey tones.

239
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
It's Shoegaze Mopey Tones.

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
This is my friend, Shoegaze Mopey Tones.

241
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
This is why SNL has new casts.

242
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
You know what I mean?

243
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
Because then you bring in somebody.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
I bet Melissa Villasenor knows what shoegaze is.

245
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,960
Yeah, we need some younger McElroy's.

246
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
Let's get Charlie in here.

247
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
I am working on it.

248
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
That's a weird way to put that, Krimit.

249
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,720
Weird way to put that.

250
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
I put a baby up in my wife.

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,200
What more could I do?

252
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
Come on, come on.

253
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
Now here's, maybe this is what an opener is for.

254
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
You have an opening act.

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh yeah, make the opener come out to your fucking fog machines.

256
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,920
Weak, impotent, sputtering.

257
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,880
That is such a rough way to do them though, isn't it?

258
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,600
Yeah.

259
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,720
I've worked in theater enough that a little bit of fog

260
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
until it warms up, I guess.

261
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
No one knows how they work.

262
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
How long can you leave a fog machine on?

263
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,320
Can you just have the fog machine going

264
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
before the venue even opens?

265
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Well, then you're using up the juice, Krimit.

266
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Yeah, that juice is expensive.

267
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,440
You do not want a roadie rushing out mid-show

268
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
to swap the juice.

269
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Yeah, absolutely.

270
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,640
Fucking embarrassing.

271
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,480
You don't want to swap the juice.

272
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Can you put a garbage bag up on the exhaust tip

273
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,720
of the fog machine until that fills with fog

274
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
and then you can just take it on stage

275
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,200
and pop it or tear it open to get a bunch of fog all at once.

276
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
Just like all at once.

277
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh yeah, like that.

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
That's cool.

279
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,080
Cool, the problem is I know you don't want people

280
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,800
to notice the fog machine and I do understand that,

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,600
but they also have to notice a little bit

282
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
or they're gonna assume there's a fire, right?

283
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
If there's just all of a sudden a bunch of smoke,

284
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,160
you're gonna think, well, there's smoke, there's fire.

285
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,600
You're gonna think that, you know what I mean?

286
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
You know what, boys?

287
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm going down a trip down memory lane

288
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
that it's one of the many, many things from my youth

289
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,640
that I really haven't relitigated since then

290
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
because if I would have,

291
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,760
I would have realized how extremely busted it was.

292
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,640
We did the Easter pageant every year

293
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,280
and at that great scene where Jesus kicks open the tomb

294
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
and is like, what's up, I'm back,

295
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,360
we had a fog machine for that.

296
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,560
And as far as I can remember,

297
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
they only use this one bottle of fog machine juice

298
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,880
for every show and it smelled so strongly

299
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
of what its smell was, which was piña colada,

300
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
which seems at our Southern Baptist Church.

301
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
Here he comes, Christ is King, the redeemer.

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
He is back and better than ever, baby.

303
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,880
And also some tropical themes happening in your nose.

304
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Celebrate Christ's birth on the beach.

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm just saying maybe this is why I enjoy piña colada so much

306
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,680
is because I sort of think about them in the same way

307
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,280
I think about the resurrection of Christ.

308
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,000
I drink one of those cold fruity babies on a beach

309
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,840
and I just think about when I rolled that stone away.

310
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,400
Sometimes those can bring me back to life.

311
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,720
This is a fun experience

312
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
because what the listeners don't know

313
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
is I dropped out for like 30 seconds

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,080
because of computer issues and just rejoined

315
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,600
and I have no fucking clue how we got.

316
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,560
The last thing I heard was like pop a big bag full of stuff

317
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,280
to piña coladas, make me think about Jesus.

318
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
My brain does that for me sometimes while we're recording

319
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
and that's actually pretty nice.

320
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
It can be fun, kind of a fun jumping off point.

321
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Do you want a Yahoo, fellas?

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
I'd love that, Griffin, thank you.

323
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck.

324
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,720
Thank you, Graham.

325
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,840
It's Yahoo Answers user Gary the human being who asks.

326
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,840
Wait, how much fog can you get in your mouth at one time?

327
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,560
You talking about ripping mad cotton?

328
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,880
Just like all at once the show starts

329
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
and everybody's just like.

330
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
I guess it depends on if you want to live

331
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
with cool lungs after that

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because probably the answer would be zero.

333
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,960
It's just juice, Griffin.

334
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,080
It's just juice.

335
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Pretty sure it's toxic.

336
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
Okay, so Gary the human being asks,

337
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,960
as long as you never give up, you can't fail?

338
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,760
And then in the additional details,

339
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,080
still time on the clock?

340
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,400
I thought that this is one of the more powerful,

341
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,880
motivational sort of, I guess not speech,

342
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,840
but tagline that if you don't stop trying,

343
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
you can't fail.

344
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,240
Fail.

345
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
But that's just wildly untrue.

346
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,240
Okay, let's see, let's see.

347
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
Okay, Griffin, I'm a boxer, right?

348
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,640
And I've just been knocked out.

349
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Yeah.

350
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
They ring the bell and then I stand up and say,

351
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
let's keep going.

352
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,280
Yeah.

353
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm not done.

354
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm not done, I've lost.

355
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
You lost, but did you fail?

356
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah, I failed to win.

357
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah, but you don't give up boxing, do you?

358
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,920
I turn in my test in math class.

359
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,420
Yeah.

360
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
I've gotten all the answers wrong,

361
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,640
but I just keep writing more numbers.

362
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah, but if you keep working in math,

363
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
you didn't fail, did you?

364
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
But I failed the test.

365
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
You did fail that big test.

366
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
You did fail the test, but here's the thing,

367
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,760
you didn't give up, because you keep trying.

368
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,880
You can keep asking, are you sure I failed the test?

369
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
And then you could be like, can you check again?

370
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,360
And then you could be like, this is illegal.

371
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,320
The test is illegal.

372
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,920
I don't gotta go to court to prove it.

373
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,600
And then you could lose currently 47 of those court battles.

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,520
And then, but you haven't failed.

375
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,240
You didn't fail yet.

376
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,760
You're just still trying.

377
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
Is there a yet missing from this sentence?

378
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,080
You haven't failed yet.

379
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,640
Yeah, you haven't failed completely.

380
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,040
I think that you've mostly failed.

381
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,560
There is still one degree to which you have not failed.

382
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,080
I think that the world needs to recalibrate a little bit, frankly.

383
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
I've been thinking about this a lot,

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
where we've got this whole chip on our shoulders

385
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
when it comes to like, well, you didn't give up.

386
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,480
You didn't fail.

387
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,520
And like, you know, if you failed a plan, you plan for it.

388
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
Sometimes the most respect I have for someone

389
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
is when they realize they're not good at something

390
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,800
and stop doing it.

391
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,000
And they say, maybe I'm gonna try something I am good at.

392
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
And they find that thing.

393
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
And this comes from someone who was really bad

394
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
at wrestling in middle school.

395
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
And dad convinced me not to quit the team by saying, quote,

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
McElroy's don't quit, which is wildly untrue.

397
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Did he say, if you don't quit, you don't fail,

398
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
there's still time on the clock?

399
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,920
I think what he said is, if you don't fail,

400
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
then you haven't failed.

401
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
And if you quit, then I won't have any children

402
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,960
who even pretend to do sports.

403
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Oh God, oh God, please don't quit.

404
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,460
Yeah.

405
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,800
And so what I'm saying is, maybe what we should do

406
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,720
is encourage people to give up more.

407
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,240
This is-

408
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
Like, hey, you don't like that thing.

409
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,600
That thing doesn't make you happy.

410
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,960
Stop doing it.

411
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,920
But this is the opposite of this power.

412
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,240
I came here with this powerful Yahoo.

413
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,000
And I was trying to inspire a generation.

414
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,840
But it didn't work.

415
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,480
It didn't work.

416
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
I can't remember what the genera-

417
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,580
Z's?

418
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't remember what the-

419
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,800
No, we're back around.

420
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
We're at AAs now.

421
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
I don't think that's accurate.

422
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
I think that's true.

423
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,680
These zenies, they don't know how to fail.

424
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,040
We will teach-

425
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,680
Or they know how to fail too comfortably, Griffin.

426
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,280
But they don't give up.

427
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,800
And it's time on the clock.

428
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
Maybe they should.

429
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
Okay, maybe they should.

430
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Or maybe they shouldn't.

431
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,800
This is what I'm saying is, we're so worried

432
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,240
about debt forgiveness.

433
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,720
What about debt permission?

434
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Okay.

435
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, like when someone says,

436
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
hey, you owe me a lot of money for your student loans,

437
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,760
you just go, no.

438
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,960
No, forgive me.

439
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,320
How about that?

440
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,160
And they're like, please give me that money.

441
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,200
And you're like, no.

442
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't think so.

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,320
Actually-

444
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,920
Tough.

445
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
I just wonder if-

446
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,280
I don't know.

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,960
Can you just say out loud, I forgive you for all your debts?

448
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
You want me to say, I forgive you for all your debts?

449
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,840
You said it.

450
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
I tricked you, Mr. Mix's Piddlic.

451
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
You said your own name.

452
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
Now I don't have any more students' debts.

453
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
What you can also do, you can trick someone

454
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,800
into your debt cave, and then it's their debt,

455
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,600
and you're free.

456
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,160
Yeah.

457
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,520
I tried this in college, and what I experienced,

458
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,040
and sort of after college with credit card debt,

459
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,240
what I experienced was a series of men

460
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,680
with progressively lower voices calling me

461
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,400
about the money that they would very much enjoy.

462
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,880
Until you-

463
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520
No, that's fair.

464
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,680
I did have to fill out a series of more and more complicated

465
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,640
paperwork explaining to people how I didn't have money

466
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,880
to give them, and it wasn't just that I didn't want

467
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
to give them that money.

468
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,560
It's that I physically did not have it,

469
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,440
and any amount of money they asked me for,

470
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,640
I wouldn't be able to give them.

471
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
One time I filled out a piece of paper that explained

472
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
where all of my monthly income went,

473
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,480
and I fudged it to not show being in debt,

474
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
and made it seem like at the end of the month

475
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,280
I had $5 surplus, and they wrote back and told me

476
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,400
that I owed them $275 a month,

477
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,680
and I then contacted them and said,

478
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
hey, this seems like a bad system.

479
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,440
You've seen the numbers.

480
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
I showed you.

481
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
We crunched them together.

482
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
I showed you the math.

483
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
I was very detailed, and I said, I even,

484
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm going to be honest, lied to make it seem

485
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,440
like I had more money than I did,

486
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
and they said, oh, no, no, no.

487
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,840
You don't need to do that.

488
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
Just show the negative.

489
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,040
We expect there to be a negative, and I said, okay,

490
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,560
so then I did the actual math,

491
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,600
and they lowered my expected payment to $150 a month.

492
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,040
Okay, so now that they know you have negative money,

493
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
now they want a sensible 150.

494
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,360
Yes, so what I'm saying is,

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
maybe everybody should stop paying people money.

496
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,320
Okay.

497
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
We're all just going to stop.

498
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,160
Yeah.

499
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
But if we can't-

500
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,080
They can't collect on all of us at once.

501
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
But here's the problem.

502
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
Here's the problem, and this is maybe,

503
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
God, I'm thinking about it, I definitely just inspired

504
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
a generation with this thing from Yahoo,

505
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,480
but to use your example, the debt collectors heard it.

506
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
And the debt collectors heard,

507
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,520
as long as you never give up, you can't fail.

508
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
And they're like, I can't fail to get Travis's negative $200.

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,040
Because if I do-

510
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, they can try.

511
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
If I give up, then I failed at it.

512
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
There's still time on the clock.

513
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
They're still trying too.

514
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,800
Well, okay, then I know how to fix that.

515
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,320
Debt collectors, if you're listening,

516
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
and I assume you are,

517
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
you can still collect debt from each other.

518
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay, yeah.

519
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
You can go live in a little debt collector society

520
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,480
where every debt is just passed from one to another

521
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
and no actual money is ever exchanged.

522
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,120
Hey, let's try something else too, okay?

523
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
Okay, yeah.

524
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,600
Everyone listening to this,

525
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
everybody currently under the power of my voice,

526
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I forgive your debt.

527
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
Wow, you-

528
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,080
You, listen, you did nothing wrong.

529
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
You needed the money.

530
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,080
You got it.

531
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,040
Then you didn't have it to give it back to them.

532
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,120
I forgive you.

533
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,680
Do you forget the debt?

534
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh, man.

535
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,800
Yeah.

536
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,300
No.

537
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
I'll never, I'll never.

538
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
I forgive your debt.

539
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,360
Go fly free.

540
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
But I'm watching.

541
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,440
I'll be watching.

542
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Would you guys like another question?

543
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,580
Please.

544
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,540
Okay.

545
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Since COVID, my mom has been-

546
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,080
Why COVID?

547
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,040
What?

548
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,640
Oh, it's a disease.

549
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,440
Oh, my mom has been spending lots of time

550
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
writing within the paranormal romance genre.

551
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Spooky sex, as some prefer.

552
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,040
Unbeknownst to her,

553
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,360
I have been doing precisely the same thing,

554
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,000
except instead of a trilogy of original YA novels,

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,280
I've been working on a well-received anthology series of fan fiction.

556
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
When she describes her plots to me,

557
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I often find plenty of interesting parallels

558
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
between my stories and hers.

559
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,080
I want to discuss them,

560
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
but I know she assumes all fan fiction

561
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
is inherently poorly written and or pornographic.

562
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
How can I talk to her about our respective sets

563
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
of ghost whispering lovebirds

564
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
without admitting to such a taboo hobby?

565
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
That's from Sexy Seance in Central Florida.

566
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
So you are worried that your mother,

567
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
who is also writing paranormal sex stories-

568
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,520
It's OC.

569
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
She's writing ghost sex stories.

570
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
She's going to look down on your fucking

571
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
My Hero Academia slash pick.

572
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,960
Come on, damn.

573
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Their mom is working with OC's,

574
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,480
original characters, original content.

575
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, but nothing's original anymore, Griffin.

576
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
Shakespeare did it all, you know what I mean?

577
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,680
Thank you.

578
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
So Shakespeare had all kinds of ghost sex up in there.

579
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,240
You know what I mean?

580
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,360
So like, it ain't new.

581
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,840
That's fine.

582
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,040
I'll never forget that one scene

583
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,680
where it's Laertes slash old Hamlet.

584
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:33,920
Yeah.

585
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,640
You know what I mean?

586
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,360
I guess so, but if you got one where it's like,

587
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
here's fucking, here's the Grinch,

588
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,920
and he's going to do it,

589
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,720
you can't be like, is there anything new anymore?

590
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,680
Have you been reading mine, Griffin?

591
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,240
That's mine.

592
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,720
I've been reading-

593
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
My Grinch, Grinch slash Grinch,

594
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,280
when it's the Grinch from the animated one

595
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,200
has sex with Jim Carrey's The Grinch.

596
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,160
Fantastic stuff.

597
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,600
And also the tool man's there.

598
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
Fantastic stuff.

599
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,440
He's got to be there.

600
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,880
He's become like the observer.

601
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes, indeed.

602
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
He's always there.

603
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,160
God, this is, can I say something?

604
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,080
This is kind of cute.

605
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
It's kind of cute.

606
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

607
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
Like, it's going to be good.

608
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
And it's going to be like a good commercial for,

609
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,400
I don't know, the paper that it's-

610
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,880
McDonald's?

611
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,720
McDonald's, where you guys show each other your fictions

612
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
and you both go, ah, the best part of wake-

613
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,840
I don't know why coffee is there.

614
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
Your friend coffee is there.

615
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,200
We can get anything in there.

616
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
This would make a plot for a movie

617
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
and you can call it Freaky Friday.

618
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah, now we would have to do a lot of press, Trav,

619
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
for that one to just sort of get it out there

620
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
to get our messaging out there

621
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
that you have to say freaky

622
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,240
in a way that lets people know it's not that freaky.

623
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,080
You can do that with font, Griffin.

624
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,600
Describe that.

625
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,640
Is it just italics?

626
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,920
Well, there is some slant to it, yes.

627
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,400
Okay.

628
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
But there is also, clearly it's emphasized

629
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
and maybe a little sexual.

630
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Just share-

631
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,200
The letters themselves are some lilfs.

632
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,240
Jeez, man.

633
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,760
Some nice squishy holes in the G.

634
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
Oh, yeah.

635
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, yeah.

636
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Listen.

637
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
Now we got to go through the alphabet

638
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
picking out the letters you can have sex with.

639
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,000
We're just, you know,

640
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,120
you're, God, you wanna do something disgusting?

641
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,800
We've done that with numbers.

642
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
This is vulgar.

643
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,280
I don't enjoy this.

644
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,960
We have, you're remembering.

645
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
We can't, yeah, listen,

646
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
all the different Arabic characters

647
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,040
are just really horny.

648
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,040
You know, every genre and sub-genre

649
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,000
and type of new media is looked down upon

650
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,160
by its forebearers

651
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,680
until something comes along that is irrefutable.

652
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,520
And maybe your slash fiction is that.

653
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,680
At first the world looked down its nose at,

654
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
you know, the novel

655
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,000
and then here comes fucking Pilgrim's Progress

656
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,040
or something, you know what I mean?

657
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,320
Like an old novel or something

658
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
that's like these are legit.

659
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
Very sexy book, Pilgrim's Progress.

660
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
Let your mom see your stories.

661
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
I think, honestly,

662
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,040
I know that even if they look down,

663
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,760
your mom looks down at that kind of work a little bit,

664
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
I think if you are the one doing it,

665
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
their precious child,

666
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
I think that they're gonna be supportive of you

667
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
and they're gonna turn it around.

668
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,960
And if you wait too long

669
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
and the stories are too similar,

670
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,400
your mom is gonna start feeling

671
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
like maybe you're being a little sus

672
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,080
when she finds out later,

673
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,040
oh, what's that?

674
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,320
You've been cribbing.

675
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
I had the two-date ghost

676
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
and you put that in your story too.

677
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,640
And she's not gonna believe that it's a holy,

678
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
you know, it's just an invention

679
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,920
of your third eye.

680
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,840
Yeah, a poke hergeist?

681
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,120
I'm thinking about it.

682
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,760
Why you give back seconds upon it?

683
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
Sexorcist is fucking great, Trav.

684
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
Congratulations.

685
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Oh, there's a medal.

686
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,080
Oh, it's floating down from the ceiling.

687
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,040
Yeah, it's being handed to you by Jad Appenbron.

688
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,560
It's bringing you this medal.

689
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,120
I did it.

690
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,720
I won podcasting.

691
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,520
You did it.

692
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,040
Oh, there's a ghost of fucking-

693
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,560
Oh, and here's Roman Morris

694
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,920
with a bouquet of flowers.

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
That's so nice.

696
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,160
And Joe Rogan's at his house, I guess.

697
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
I don't know what he's doing right now.

698
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,720
Well, he's the one I beat.

699
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,040
Let's take a break

700
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,120
and go to the Money Zone very quickly.

701
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,960
Listen, real quick.

702
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
I don't have a lot of time.

703
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
Are you paying attention?

704
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,400
They're coming.

705
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
We need to hurry.

706
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
This holiday season,

707
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,560
more people will be mailing stuff than ever before.

708
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,440
That means the post office is gonna be busy, okay?

709
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360

Wake up.

Once your mail is ready,

718
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,680
just schedule a pickup or drop it off.

719
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,720

That's Stamps.com, My Brother.

738
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,320
Stamps.com, never go to the post office again.

739
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
Ah, they got me!

740
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,560
I wish we could, I wish.

741
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,520
You know, those conspiracy podcasts

742
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,600
are obviously detrimental to the fabric of society,

743
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,280
but man, I bet it'd be fun.

744
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,440
I bet that's a fun set to work on.

745
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah, it'd be a fun space, fun space to play in.

746
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
Speaking of space, Squarespace.

747
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm not gonna do both of them.

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Yeah, let me try it

749
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,680
and I'll try to do what Travis did,

750
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,360
like his character, like conspiracy guy.

751
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,800
Okay, do it, do it, do it.

752
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
Oh man, the internet.

753
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,080
The internet, everybody's watching you on it

754
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,360
and tracking your every move.

755
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Vaccines, man.

756
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Wait, were you drinking vaccines?

757
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,960
Yeah.

758
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
That's what I got.

759
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, it kind of sounded like you were just slaking

760
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,760
your thirst with some frosted vaccines.

761
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,680
I was trying to make like a bong noise,

762
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,520
but then I do like better.

763
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,680
Yeah, so you don't need government vaccines

764
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,400
because of the stuff in them,

765
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
but my vaccines are good.

766
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,040
You drink them and I mix them in with some Danimals.

767
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
You're gonna go nuts for it

768
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
and I'm selling these on my website

769
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,720
I made with Squarespace

770
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,000
because Squarespace lets you make a beautiful website

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,960
and it's easy and you can showcase your work

772
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,160
or sell products like vaccine-infused Danimals

773
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,480
or services of all kinds.

774
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,400
You can promote your physical or online business

775
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
and they give you a bunch of-

776
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,520
Now, Griffin, just one quick note, if I may.

777
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Your conspiracy theorist character

778
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,840
is kind of drifting into a very pleasant

779
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,800
Squarespace spokesperson.

780
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm enjoying my time with him.

781
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,080
Oh, okay, I'll try and take it back. Beautiful, customizable templates

782
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,240
created by world-class designers.

783
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,120
Whose world?

784
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Who's Griffin's world?

785
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Not my, maybe my world.

786
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,000
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box

787
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,880
if you're silly enough to still have a phone

788
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,400
with a screen on it where they track you and pictures.

789
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,520
And it's got free and secure hosting.

790
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,360
I don't know if they do dark web stuff,

791
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,600
but I think I like that maybe.

792
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
And there's nothing to patch or upgrade, ever.

793
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,040
And go to Squ-

794
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,600
Never?

795
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,960
Never, you don't.

796
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
It's like a good machete.

797
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,880
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

800
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,560
Now, I wanna do an ad.

801
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
Okay, what are you doing an ad for?

802
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,040
We don't have any more.

803
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,760
I wanna do one too with this guy.

804
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,320
Okay, what are you gonna talk about?

805
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,400
Everybody's having such a good time.

806
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,800
But you need to talk about a product though.

807
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,920
Well, okay.

808
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,560
Are you guys giving to charity?

809
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,200
You're becoming like Doc Brown.

810
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
That's good.

811
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,520
Everybody support your local bookstores.

812
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,640
Buy local produce.

813
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Farm to table, Marty.

814
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
Well, hello, I'm Renee Colvert.

815
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
Hi, I'm Alexis Preston.

816
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
And we are the host of Can I Pet Your Dog?

817
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,760
And we got breaking news.

818
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,560
We got an expose that all the beans have been spilled

819
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,280
via an Apple podcast review that said

820
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,240
this show isn't well researched.

821
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,280
Well, yeah, no duh.

822
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,240
Of course, it's not.

823
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

824
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,760
Guessing?

825
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Guessing?

826
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,680
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

827
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Guessing and anthropomorphizing dogs is what we do.

828
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,000
The Can I Pet Your Dog promise is that we will never do more

829
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
than 10 seconds of research before telling you

830
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
excitedly about any dog we see.

831
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm gonna come at you with top 10 enthusiasm, minimal facts.

832
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,160
We're here for a good time, not an educated time.

833
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,560
So if you love dogs and you don't love research,

834
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,520
well, you know what?

835
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,920
Come on in to Can I Pet Your Dog podcast

836
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,760
every Tuesday on Maximum Fun Network.

837
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,520
Can I Pet Your Dog?

838
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,600
I would like to do the Munch Squad bit though.

839
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,100
Okay.

840
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,600
I want a Munch Squad.

841
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,520
I want to Munch Squad.

842
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
Do you guys know what?

843
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,160
Do you guys know what the Munch Squad is about this week?

844
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes.

845
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,520
Okay.

846
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,080
Travis, do you?

847
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,320
Yes.

848
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,040
Yes.

849
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,240
No, I don't want to guess.

850
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,680
I just want to know if you know.

851
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,480
Yeah.

852
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,980
Okay.

853
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, let's just enjoy this together then.

854
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,640
This is just going to take a minute and 12 seconds,

855
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,840
but I think it is well earned.

856
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,200
Could I have silence from my brothers, please?

857
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,680
Here we go.

858
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
What the hell are you doing?

859
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,360
A lifetime original mini movie.

860
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,640
You don't answer my proposal and now you're not answering my call.

861
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
I think I'm falling for the new chef.

862
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,720
Jessica is falling for Harlan.

863
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,640
The cook?

864
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,320
Leave Jessica alone and skip town.

865
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,200
He has a secret recipe that's going to change the world.

866
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,280
Harlan claims to have some secret recipe.

867
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,400
A secret recipe?

868
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,600
Please spare me.

869
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,720
We all have our secrets.

870
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
If you marry my daughter,

871
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,400
I promise there'll be more long weekends in your future.

872
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
Mom, I have to tell you something.

873
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,960
We have a problem.

874
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
Secrets out, chicken man.

875
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
I'll take care of this.

876
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,080
You're ruining everything!

877
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,200
Just kill him already!

878
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Who the hell are you?

879
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,720
Harlan Sanders, the new chef.

880
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,680
Mario Lopez is Colonel Sanders in a recipe for seduction.

881
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,360
Premieres December 13th at noon only on Lifetime.

882
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,160
Presented by Kentucky Fried Chicken.

883
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
But like, what if it's good though?

884
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,400
What if it's like really, really like Oscar contender good?

885
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
Sexual, you know what I mean?

886
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,760
I don't think we can jump right to the what if it's good take, Griffin.

887
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,040
There's so many other things I think we need to get out of the way first.

888
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
The one that I want to touch on is there at the end

889
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,720
when they felt it necessary to clarify that it was sponsored by Kentucky Fried Chicken.

890
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes, thank you.

891
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,280
I was about to highlight that.

892
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,600
What a wild world it would be if it was like,

893
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,760
unofficial, not approved or endorsed in any way.

894
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
Inspired by true events.

895
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,200
Currently impending legal action from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

896
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,360
There's fucking secrets out, chicken man.

897
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,320
Mario Lopez is just crazy about these buckets.

898
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
So he's funding it himself.

899
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,760
I would also like to point out that prime debut slide.

900
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
Yeah, noon, noon, classic.

901
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,720
So here's the press release.

902
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,080
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lifetime are teaming up to bring consumers

903
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,200
the perfect distraction from all things 2020.

904
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,680
The holiday lifetime original mini movie, a recipe for seduction.

905
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,600
Featuring veteran actor and star of Lifetime's Feliz Navidad,

906
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,920
Mario Lopez as Colonel Harlan Sanders.

907
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
The first of its kind.

908
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
Let's fucking hope so.

909
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,640
Lifetime original mini movie.

910
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,280
It's full of mystery, suspense, deception, foul play.

911
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
And at the heart of it all, love and fried chicken.

912
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,120
Huh.

913
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,160
To enhance the viewing experience of deep fried holiday romance,

914
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,840
consumers can order KFC on Uber Eats for delivery

915
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,480
and get six free extra crispy tenders with a $20 purchase or more.

916
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,880
While enjoying the delicious taste of the Colonel's secret 11 herbs and spices,

917
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,320
viewers can share in all the drama of this steamy holiday love affair

918
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,920
as they watch a young heiress contend with the affections of a suitor

919
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
handpicked by her mother.

920
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,400
Now it does beg the question, I've just spent $20 at KFC

921
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,240
and I've gotten six free extra tenders.

922
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,280
How much of this can I eat in a 15 minute film?

923
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
Because I am already dreading that experience.

924
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,200
When a handsome young chef with a secret fried chicken recipe and a dream arrives,

925
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,240
he sets in motion a series of events that unravel the mother's devious plans.

926
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,800
That's the whole movie then, huh?

927
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

928
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,200
Quote, we're no stranger to heating things up for the holidays,

929
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,560
just like our famous...

930
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,840
How do you think this ends?

931
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Fried chicken meals?

932
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
An interesting guess.

933
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,400
Travis, do you have a guess?

934
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,400
Spices and flavors?

935
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
Just like our famous fried chicken.

936
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,280
Scented fire log.

937
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,280
But let's face it, we could all use a little distraction this holiday season.

938
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Fuck it, they got it, folks!

939
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,360
Yeah.

940
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,000
They got it at the buzzer!

941
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
At the buzzer!

942
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,760
COVID's been hard, so we put a fake mustache and goatee on Macy Slater

943
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,600
and we're just fucking going for it.

944
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Because this'll do it, right?

945
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,800
Will this do it?

946
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
KFC Slater.

947
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Why not fill some of your...

948
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh man, it's just right here.

949
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,160
Let's face it, we could all use a little distraction this holiday season.

950
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,360
So why not fill some of your time at home?

951
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,800
I mean...

952
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,840
But Grandpapa, what was 2020 like?

953
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,200
Well, it wasn't all bad.

954
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,800
There was, right there at the end, there was a real buzzer beater of a Brideslot.

955
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I'll be straight with you, Bryson.

956
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,680
It was mondo fucking boring.

957
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,320
But then my boy KFC Slater rolled in.

958
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,440
We were saved at the end of the year by President Lopez.

959
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,120
President Lopez, well, he was just Mario to us back then.

960
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,040
But you know what?

961
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,600
I can track it all back to that one day, December 13th at noon,

962
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,200
when the whole world changed.

963
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,320
There was, of course, BRS before Recipe for Seduction,

964
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,600
and of course, ARS after Recipe for Seduction.

965
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,840
Now pass me the KFC Bible and I'll tell you more.

966
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:53,520
A Recipe for Seduction is Lifetime and KFC's first ever branded custom midform content.

967
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,080
Oh!

968
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,520
The Lifetime original movie is a playful addition to, well, I mean, you get it.

969
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah, once you get all businessy, it's like, ugh, can we just have fun here?

970
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,280
It is a good question, though.

971
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,960
What will you do for the other 15 minutes, Lifetime?

972
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,680
What is it?

973
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
This is the first 15 minute thing you've made.

974
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,560
What are you gonna throw on a fucking episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?

975
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,080
That's a good question.

976
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,600
What are you doing after this?

977
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,800
After its linear premiere, a Recipe for Seduction will be unbound from reality.

978
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
Continue to be available throughout the holiday season

979
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,440
on mylifetime.com forward slash Christmas hyphen movies,

980
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,800
all Lifetime apps and VOD platforms.

981
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,480
Quote, Lifetime is the perfect holiday home to bring this spicy, unexpected tale to life,

982
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,920
said David DeSocio-Path, I'm assuming, UVP of ad sales and marketing partnerships,

983
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,280
A&E Networks, through a terrific cast and with a wink to the unique sensibilities

984
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,040
celebrated in Lifetime movies.

985
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,800
This co-production spotlights, can we just have something nice?

986
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
I mean, can we just have something nice?

987
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,360
That we did a KFC Lifetime movie.

988
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,000
Just say that!

989
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,040
It's fun!

990
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,960
We've blended the beloved sensibilities of the Lifetime-

991
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,680
But this is dumb as shit and you'll like it.

992
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
You'll like it for 15 minutes and you'll forget about it.

993
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,680
We made a chicken log!

994
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,240
And you'll pretend like you didn't like it and you'll be all ironic about it,

995
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,840
but you were sincerely happy we did it and you can admit that here.

996
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,800
You know us.

997
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,000
You know us, what we do with our chicken log.

998
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,560
You know what this is.

999
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
Just don't make it into a fucking business thing.

1000
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
You're not gonna sell any more chicken because of this.

1001
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,720
This is the problem.

1002
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,040
Just let's have fun.

1003
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,440
It's a nice thing because apparently it's been a challenging year according to this press release.

1004
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,280
It's been a hard year for a lot of us.

1005
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
Apparently.

1006
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,080
Here's the thing is that kind of brand explanation,

1007
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,800
that's where you get into too self-aware where I'm like,

1008
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,840
oh, you did this for money, you business.

1009
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,160
Yeah.

1010
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
And that's where I forget that KFC isn't my fun friend.

1011
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah, sure.

1012
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,880
Um, hey, who wants a yahoo?

1013
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,760
Hey, yahoo.

1014
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,880
I'll take one, sir.

1015
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,920
Yahoo here, sir.

1016
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,040
Uh, yahoo.

1017
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,560
Yahoo here for the boy.

1018
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,680
Here comes yahoo's.

1019
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,480
Okay, this one is-

1020
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,520
Oh, too hot!

1021
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,360
You've burned my boy's face.

1022
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,400
They don't have temperature.

1023
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,240
He's dead.

1024
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,720
There's no-

1025
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,960
Oh God, my boy is dead.

1026
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
Did you dump something else hot on him, sir?

1027
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Because they don't have temperature.

1028
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,560
I put the yahoo on my boy's head and now he's melted.

1029
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,280
But look at it.

1030
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,760
Oh, he was my only boy.

1031
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,720
Just as you instructed,

1032
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,160
we blended it with law and gave it to him thrice daily.

1033
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,680
Um, so this yahoo was, uh, sent in by Ellie.

1034
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,920
It's from an anonymous user who asks.

1035
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,880
Oh, they need a name.

1036
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,840
I forgot that I do that.

1037
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,480
You wanna say Travis?

1038
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,080
The scrunch asks,

1039
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,000
could you have a normal relationship

1040
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,760
with someone who is very, very psychic?

1041
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,680
Like they can see everything.

1042
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,000
You wonder if anything about you is a mystery?

1043
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
There are five updates.

1044
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,320
Update one.

1045
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh yes, it has happened already.

1046
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,440
Trust me, every day it happens.

1047
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,400
Update two.

1048
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
That said, not looking for an answer

1049
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,720
from those who don't believe it.

1050
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,000
It's a real issue I'm dealing with here

1051
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,160
from a guy who's not very open to talking to me about it.

1052
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,800
Update three.

1053
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,120
He's proven he's psychic already.

1054
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,760
Update four.

1055
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,080
No, he was talking about me eating a donut yesterday

1056
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,200
before I even knew my sister bought one at the store for me.

1057
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,400
I don't have donuts every week,

1058
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,080
so it's not a regular pattern.

1059
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,800
Update five.

1060
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,800
Thanks, in quotes.

1061
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,760
No, he is.

1062
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,960
There is proof.

1063
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,480
If you're in denial about psychics,

1064
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,760
don't answer the question.

1065
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,320
Okay.

1066
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,040
Can I, this is the first time, Griffin,

1067
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,360
at which the additional details

1068
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,640
has made me retroactively wonder about the scenario

1069
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,800
that led to the specific question.

1070
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,640
Do you think this question asker wants to date this person?

1071
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,120
No, I think they're in a relationship with this person

1072
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,360
and I think that they live together

1073
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,160
and I think that they woke up one Sunday morning

1074
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,640
and they are having a slow start to the day

1075
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,120
and the husband says, you're going to eat a cake donut

1076
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,520
and then the sister brings a cake donut

1077
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,880
and then this woman is like, holy fucking shit.

1078
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,000
You are very, very psychic.

1079
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,960
I think I would happily be in a relationship

1080
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,400
with someone who's very, very psychic.

1081
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,520
Travis, Travis, Travis.

1082
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:19,840
Yeah.

1083
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,520
You're not, we're not talking about fucking crossing over

1084
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,040
with John Edwards.

1085
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,000
Or Ghost Whisperer.

1086
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,480
Or Ghost Whisperer.

1087
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah, not bullshit like that.

1088
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,640
No, they're just psychic.

1089
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm talking about someone who is very,

1090
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,160
just super psychic, Travis, real, real psychic.

1091
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,920
Here's the thing though, Griffin.

1092
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,320
Yeah?

1093
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,760
The question is not about their level of psychonicity.

1094
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,840
The question is how accepting are they of me

1095
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,920
and everything that I am, right?

1096
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,720
Do they accept me for who I am with all my flaws?

1097
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,920
Because if so, I have nothing to hide from them.

1098
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,320
Okay.

1099
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,800
It is only if they are judgmental

1100
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,320
that I would feel embarrassed if they knew everything about me.

1101
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,840
But we gotta have secrets, don't we?

1102
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
Little sneak, little sneak rits.

1103
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
That nobody gets to see stuff that we get to do

1104
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,280
that no one else gets to see that we do them.

1105
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,640
Do y'all not have-

1106
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I'd rather share my sneak rits with my partner.

1107
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,640
Can we get down to the real issue of this question, please?

1108
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,520
Sure, sure.

1109
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,160
Okay.

1110
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
I think I felt like we've been dancing around a bit.

1111
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,120
Obviously, yes.

1112
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,360
Okay.

1113
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,080
If you're at the grocery store and you're looking at doughnuts,

1114
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,800
what prompts you to think,

1115
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,880
well, Paula doesn't frequently eat doughnuts.

1116
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,840
In fact, it's probably a less than weekly occurrence,

1117
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,760
but I'm gonna bring her one single grubby doughnut.

1118
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,480
Just to show Paula I'm thinking about her,

1119
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,760
I wanna pick one.

1120
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
I'm gonna get some of this paper.

1121
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,280
I'm gonna open this up.

1122
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,680
I'm gonna get one grubby little doughnut

1123
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,560
to bring to my sister who does not enjoy them enough

1124
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,920
to eat them frequently.

1125
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,360
Well, Justin, ironically enough,

1126
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,280
just like my favorite procedural mystery, psych,

1127
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
it is all now laying out before me.

1128
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,240
I can see the timeline.

1129
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,880
Jim called Paula and said,

1130
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,200
hey, remember when you ate that doughnut?

1131
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,280
And Paula said, I haven't eaten a doughnut

1132
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,120
in at least a week and a half.

1133
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,000
And Jim said, oh man, I look like such an idiot.

1134
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,320
So he called Paula's sister, Paula too,

1135
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,160
and said, hey, can you get Paula a doughnut today?

1136
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,520
And don't make a big deal out of it

1137
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,800
and don't tell her I called.

1138
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,680
Thank you.

1139
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,600
And the sister's going through a real bad divorce.

1140
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,080
So she's got lots of time to go get on a single doughnut run.

1141
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah, and also the librarian wasn't dead.

1142
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,600
He faked it so that he could sneak back in

1143
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,040
and get the jewel himself.

1144
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,240
It's just that grocery store doughnuts are the worst.

1145
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
I mean, if you're gonna eat a doughnut,

1146
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,120
you're gonna treat yourself to a doughnut.

1147
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,360
Don't eat one from the grocery store.

1148
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,240
Yeah, well, but the convenience factor is there, Justin.

1149
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,200
You're getting everything else.

1150
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,960
I can't get my roasted beef from a Dunkin.

1151
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,360
Yeah, man, it would be cool

1152
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,960
if you're in a relationship with somebody

1153
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
who could let you win the lottery every day

1154
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,560
until there was no more lottery money left

1155
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,600
because you got all of it.

1156
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,640
But then they put on the other end of the sword,

1157
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,400
they would be like, you're gonna fucking waste that.

1158
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,640
You're just thinking of someone who's very psychic.

1159
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,800
Imagine someone who's very, very psychic.

1160
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
So you could be like, hey,

1161
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,280
does Janice want to hang out with me on Saturday?

1162
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,200
And they could be like, she doesn't.

1163
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,040
Yeah, you're so psyched.

1164
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,440
I could see though, I buy that you're,

1165
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,720
see, that's what I wanted.

1166
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,960
I want to be like, I'm extremely psychic.

1167
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,480
I really, tell me the lottery numbers.

1168
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,080
I would love to, but honestly,

1169
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,840
it doesn't work out well for you in most of the futures

1170
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,800
that I can see.

1171
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
So I'm unfortunately gonna have to win.

1172
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,560
You can withhold whatever

1173
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,440
and just say that that's like, it's better that way.

1174
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,480
I'm making that call.

1175
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,600
It's better, trust me.

1176
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,560
Hey, it turns out winning all that money is bad for you.

1177
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,120
Yeah, butterfly wings.

1178
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,600
Much like it has been every single person

1179
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,200
who's ever won the lottery ever.

1180
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,720
Oh, that's a fake statistic.

1181
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,000
That can't be.

1182
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,600
Well, yeah, Griffin, of course it is.

1183
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,840
I just said every person ever.

1184
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,240
I clearly don't have any information to back that up.

1185
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,280
But anecdotally, everybody always talks about,

1186
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,600
you win the lottery, man, it's gonna ruin your life.

1187
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,200
And have there been a few cases of that?

1188
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:23,680
Sure.

1189
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,440
But most of the time,

1190
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,160
getting a big fucking bag of money like that,

1191
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,280
it's pretty cool shit.

1192
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,600
Hey, Griffin, can you step over here with me

1193
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,080
for a second?

1194
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,640
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1195
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
Of course I fucking know that.

1196
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
I'm sorry, do you want me to, sorry.

1197
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,000
No, Justin, you can stay over there.

1198
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,880
You can stay over there.

1199
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,480
Should I bring jokes with me or can jokes stay with you guys?

1200
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,680
No, you and jokes can hang out.

1201
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,320
You and jokes can hang out.

1202
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,820
Okay.

1203
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,520
Griffin, I'm trying to increase my odds

1204
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,680
by getting less people to play in the lottery.

1205
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,320
Oh, jeez.

1206
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,640
So I need to tell them the lottery is bad for them.

1207
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,120
Okay.

1208
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,680
So that they won't buy tickets so I can play.

1209
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
I like the rubber chicken thing.

1210
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,920
We probably love rubber chickens.

1211
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,720
Okay, Griffin.

1212
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,840
Yes, that's a good idea.

1213
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,400
Forget the, forget what I said, it was a joke.

1214
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,640
No, wait, we haven't, let's go back over.

1215
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,360
Okay.

1216
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,640
Hey, we're back over here.

1217
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,360
Yeah, don't do, don't play lottery.

1218
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,280
Don't play, don't play lottery.

1219
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,320
Why, Griffin?

1220
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,760
Oh, it's, it makes you sad to do it.

1221
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,040
What kind of stuff could happen to you

1222
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,520
if you won the lottery, Griffin?

1223
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,120
No one ever, no one's, you get a big pool, you fall in.

1224
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,640
Oh, boy.

1225
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,320
And you're carrying a big bucket of coins.

1226
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,880
Guys, could you excuse me, please?

1227
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,240
Oh, sure.

1228
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,880
Could you guys, I'm gonna step over here.

1229
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,380
Okay.

1230
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,360
You shouldn't beatbox.

1231
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,400
I know you've been practicing a lot, Justin,

1232
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,040
but this is not the time to show off your beatboxing skills.

1233
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,040
And I know it seems like it would make the podcast

1234
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,520
really good and funny and it would be really cool,

1235
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,120
but I need you to not beatbox.

1236
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,920
You've made it this far.

1237
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,920
Excuse me.

1238
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,040
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1239
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
I couldn't help but overhear from here.

1240
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,560
I would love to hear you beatbox.

1241
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,160
Was that it?

1242
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,840
Wait, no, Travis, that's just his open,

1243
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,520
that's just his open hi-hat.

1244
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,480
Clearly that means, closed hi-hat, closed hi-hat.

1245
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,720
Let's hear, let's hear some Tom's juice.

1246
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,240
Tom's.

1247
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,080
Tom's, Tom's, Tom's, Tom's.

1248
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,040
That's right, textbook.

1249
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,400
Now just lay all those together.

1250
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,760
Okay, Griffin will get it in post, I'm sure.

1251
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,360
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

1252
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,920
I'm sure.

1253
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,840
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast,

1254
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,440
my brother, my brother, and me.

1255
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,640
It's so fun to do it for you every week.

1256
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,760
We're just having a good time.

1257
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,440
We're just having a good time here.

1258
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,080
You know what?

1259
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
Don't, we'd do it even if people didn't listen,

1260
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,960
but it would be, the more erotic content

1261
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,080
would be more questionable, I think.

1262
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Hey, December 19th at 8 p.m., clear your calendar

1263
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,440
because we're gonna be celebrating the candle nights together.

1264
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,280
Though we can't all be physically in one area,

1265
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,880
we are still, the season arrives regardless.

1266
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,160
This is going to be a filmed candle night spectacular.

1267
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,360
We have filmed almost all of it at this point

1268
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,800
and it is going to be buck wild.

1269
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,760
It is a wild one.

1270
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,200
Yeah, we got segments from Bim Bam, Sawbone, Schmanter's Wonderful,

1271
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,640
Still Buffering, Special Guests,

1272
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
and it is going to be something else.

1273
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,920
Tickets are pay what you want with a $5 minimum

1274
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,240
and all proceeds go to Harmony House,

1275
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,320
which is a local shelter for people experiencing homelessness.

1276
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,920
They help so many people,

1277
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,560
Cindy volunteers there and can vouch for her.

1278
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,480
It is an amazing place

1279
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,800
and we are so proud to be supporting them again.

1280
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,400
Bit.ly forward slash candle nights 2020 is the address.

1281
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,960
Please go there and get what you can

1282
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,600
and come join us for that show.

1283
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,160
Sorry, real quick, it is $5 minimum

1284
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,400
but there will be $1.25 fee to cover the expenses

1285
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,600
of the people helping us do the show.

1286
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,960
So it will be $6.25 total just so that doesn't throw you off.

1287
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,200
And you will be able to watch it through January 4th, 2020.

1288
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,240
So you got a long period to enjoy it.

1289
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,040
You don't have to watch it right there December 19th at 8 p.m.

1290
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,600
But that is when it will go live.

1291
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,720
We also have a lot of cool McElroy merch.

1292
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,040
Well, I just wanted to say real quick that it's a really fun video

1293
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,240
and we made it really fun for you

1294
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,680
because we know everybody's had a hard year.

1295
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,440
Yeah, it's been a rough year for all of us.

1296
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,640
And so we made it with a bunch of herbs and spices.

1297
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,480
We've got a lot of cool merch over at McElroyMerch.com

1298
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,920
with some candle night stuff over there,

1299
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,160
stuff that you might've seen before, maybe you haven't.

1300
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,840
But the thing that I wanna highlight is the Festo pin of the month,

1301
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,800
which is Festo from the Adventure Zone graduation

1302
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,840
if you haven't listened yet.

1303
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,480
And that benefits the Transgender Law Center,

1304
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,040
which employs a variety of community driven strategies

1305
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,600
to keep transgender and gender nonconforming people

1306
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,400
alive, thriving, and fighting for liberation.

1307
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,360
So you can check that out

1308
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,240
as well as all the other stuff at McElroyMerch.com.

1309
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,080
And here we go.

1310
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,000
Three books I wanna tell you about my friends.

1311
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,480
One, Everybody Has a Podcast Except You

1312
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,840
is our how-to podcast book.

1313
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,200
It's available for pre-order now.

1314
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,680
Go to TheMcElroyPodcast.com.

1315
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,280
That comes out January 26th.

1316
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,640
So I think that's within a window

1317
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,880
that you could give that pre-order to someone

1318
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,960
as a candle night's present.

1319
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
You can also pre-order The Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom,

1320
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,240
which is book four of our graphic novel series.

1321
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,320
Go to TheAdventureZone.com.

1322
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,760
Oh, TheAdventureZoneComic.com, I should say.

1323
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,640
And that comes out July 13th, 2021.

1324
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,320
And the Sawbones book is out in paperback on December 29th.

1325
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,560
It's newly revised and updated for 2020.

1326
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,160
You can get that at bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

1327
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,800
Y'all want the final,

1328
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,720
oh, thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

1329
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,520
for the use of our theme song

1330
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,400
and to departure off the album,

1331
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,520
putting the days to bed.

1332
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,640
Great tunes, great tracks.

1333
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh, one more thing I want to say.

1334
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,160
We're doing the MBM or the MBM AM Angels

1335
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,520
is happening again.

1336
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,040
If you want to participate

1337
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
to help fill those empty stockings

1338
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,800
in our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia,

1339
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,160
you can go to MBMAMangels.com.

1340
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,520
And thanks to MaximumFun.org for having us on the network.

1341
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
Do you want the final, Yahoo?

1342
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,120
I do, Griffin.

1343
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,000
I'd really love that.

1344
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,600
This one was sent in by Amy.

1345
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,440
Or yeah, thanks, Amy.

1346
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,640
It's Yahoo Answers user Hiram who asks,

1347
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,840
let's chill.

1348
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,560
Do you Christians like V8?

1349
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,680
My name is Justin McElroy.

1350
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,560
I'm Travis Beck.

1351
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1352
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,280
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1353
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:59,040
May kiss your dad, square on the lips.
