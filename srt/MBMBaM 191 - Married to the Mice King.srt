1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,320
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm your babiest thought thinker, social guru, baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Griffin, uh, this week is at the South X South W festival. Six was six.

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm not exactly sure. It is a festival that was created by a race of alien locusts people.

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,640
And so it's been the proper pronunciation and not a lot of people get this. Not a lot of the tech

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,440
uh, thought thinker gurus here get that it's actually pronounced. Quick question. When people

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,840
refer to themselves as thought thinker gurus, are they expelled from the conference? Uh,

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
they are admitted. That's actually when you pick up your badge, they say, we got to take

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
a profile pic for our social site. And then you take a profile pic for the social site.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
And then they say, what's your position? You say, I'm a writer for a video game website. And they

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,320
go, Ooh, close, but no cigar. You go, Oh no, no, I'm shit. Sorry. I'm a thought thinker guru.

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,560
They're like, okay, come on in. Come on in and disrupt this shit. Promise me this week, Griffin,

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
when you get the person with the worst job title on their business card, something along the lines

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,480
of social media professor or ninja of tweets, master of Twitter foo, master of Twitter foo.

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,800
You take the card and then while they look on in horror, you just slowly eat it,

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
never breaking eye contact with them. And then ask for a second, then ask.

22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
The problem is that a lot of these business cards aren't actually business cards. Sometimes

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
they're jump drives. Sometimes they're bracelets. Sometimes they're actually they're Twitter

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
accounts. Sometimes they're rice crackers. People will just create bespoke Twitter accounts

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
and then hand those out as their business cards. Just to really hit the drive, the point home that

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,080
they're thought thinkers. That's okay. Maybe a slap bracelet would be the way to go. You goof,

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,440
but I Garen goddamn T it. If I walked down dirty six long enough, someone will just like,

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm walking down the street and someone will be like brand cuffs right there on me. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Did you say brand cuffs? God, Travis, it's like you're living in fucking 2011.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah. Uh, South by Southwest. Is it, is it about music? I really don't know. It's a, it's a lot of

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,040
things about armadillos and music and people playing armadillos to create music. That's exactly

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,080
right. Or turning them like stomp or turning armadillos or pressing their shells down and

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
turning them into film. That's the, all the film that gets made here and debuted here,

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,760
like the Veronica Mars movie debuted last night was printed on armadillo. It gets,

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,480
you get a really nice quality. Um, if you, if you haven't seen a apocalypse now on 35 millimeter

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,360
armadillo skin, then you just haven't seen the film. You just haven't seen it. Do you

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,240
do much star spotting at South by Southwest? Is it, is it an opportunity to spot some,

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,560
some celebs? No, I spent all my time at the gaming side of it, which is like,

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Oh God, well forget about it. I don't have any celebrities. They keep it across,

40
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,560
across the river from where all the thought thinkers are. I'm sure Norris

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
plays world of warcraft. Was he there? Uh, he doesn't and he wasn't and he can't.

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,440
Mr. T does. He doesn't. And he wouldn't, he wouldn't. And he shouldn't. And he

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,040
don't. And he can't. He's on the commercials and he plays. Is that Mario's nephew, Daniel?

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Is that Daniel Mario? That's his last name. Yeah, their last name is Mario. Um, no, it's a,

45
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,880
it's, it's a bunch of different festivals all rolled into one and it's, um, I'm not as like

46
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,240
jaded about it as literally every other Austinite is. Um, but it does make it, it does, I mean,

47
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,440
it does disrupt my taco eating because it's, well, it's all about disruptive media. They definitely

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,560
fucking get in there and they disrupt the line by which I mean, they make it quintuple the normal

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,400
line for tacos. Did you just go to Taco Bell? I just go to Taco Bell. I goofed about that

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,440
on Twitter. I was like, Hey guys, come to Austin for tacos. Just go to Taco Bell. There's a reason

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,600
why it's so popular. And then Taco Bell fucking responded on Twitter. God, nice. They were like,

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
not cool, Griffin. You could kind of hurt our feelings with that one. Of all the professional

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
relationships for you to jeopardize, you have to go and jeopardize a relationship with Taco Bell.

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,240
I know they'll, they fucking locked me out. Where am I supposed to get my fourth meal now?

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Jack in the box? No, thanks. They do have tacos there and spaghetti.

56
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
That's troubling and steak. And you can do your taxes and you can do your taxes at choppy.

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Uh, let's help people. I I'm done with this disruptive technology. It's been disruptive

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,560
to our show long enough. Uh, that said, Griffin, if you do spot any stars like during the recording,

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,560
please let me know if they walk into my office. Yeah. Or walk past your window. This is the real

60
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,800
Austin. I'm looking at two stars right now. My brothers. Uh, who? Cause you can't see us.

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
Kristen Bell and doc Shepherd. Okay. Cool. They stopped by. I was going to say,

62
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
if you're still seeing stars outside and you forgot to set your clock forward.

63
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,960
Ah, that's your problem, not mine. That's not how daylight savings. That isn't how time works.

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,200
What are you talking about? Hello, but yeah, it's called a great joke

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,440
for the show. I don't actually prefer that you don't do those anymore. Don't do great jokes.

66
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
Just, I mean, just say what you mean from now on. I'm done with jokes on this show. They're just

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,160
like silly, you know, some of our jokes are just like goofy, you know, I want to go back to that

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,800
old school joke. That high brow Dax Shepard shit. I'm on that. Talked about that. I'm on that Dax.

69
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,080
See, that's just silly. I'm on that Dax. I need, I want a joke on the show. I need jokes,

70
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,280
but set up punchline. Dax. Set up. What do you call a Dax Shepard? See, this is good, Travis.

71
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't know. What do you call a Dax? Well, I mean, presumably Dax Shepard. You call him Dax

72
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,160
Shepard. Okay. Cause that's his goddamn name. See, that had a set up and it had a punchline,

73
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,800
but it was a little lacking in the Dax department. If we're talking about basic joke construction.

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,640
Okay. Griffin, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax. Again, you were sort of deficient. Fuck me.

75
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,640
Hello brothers. My boyfriend and I have been together almost a year now. And I feel like

76
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,400
the fresh buzz of the honeymoon phase is starting to wear off. Is he listening? Put him in front of

77
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,440
the radio. Don't get me wrong. I still very much love him and cannot consider a life without him,

78
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,040
nor do I want to. It's just hard when I see friends or coworkers starting, starting cute,

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,560
new relationships. And I feel myself missing the unique twangs of new love. This is my first

80
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,120
relationship that's ever stuck. So I've never encountered this feeling before. What can I do?

81
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
That's from wistful on the West coast. And it is not a bad question.

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,560
No. And I'm, I'm very glad that that last, um, sort of interjection about this being the first

83
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,520
like long relationship because like, um, yeah, like that happens with your first long relationship.

84
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,920
I feel like, and it's not, I don't think it's something that it really is part of the territory

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,360
once you've been, um, in a couple of these bad boys. Yeah. And I think that what you're feeling

86
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:37,440
is complete, completely normal. Sure. Like here's the thing. Look like what you're seeing is the

87
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,960
cute new relationships. What you're not seeing is all the single people desperately trying to

88
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,320
connect with another human being all the shitty new relationships that are starting all of the

89
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,960
problems and fights and awkward breakups and trying to tell someone that the first date didn't

90
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,680
work out all of that, you know, all of the baggage and even worse that like the fifth date didn't

91
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,560
work out. And that's like, I, I went through a period where I like had a lot of those sort of

92
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,080
like one to two month long relationships and it sucked every single time because like you get your

93
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,000
own hopes up, you get the other person's hopes up. And then when you realize like that, it's not

94
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,480
going to work out. Like that's the, that is like seriously in all of my days and all the things I've

95
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
experienced that, that is like the shittiest feeling in the entire world. And like to me,

96
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,640
once you find that right person that you love being with and you, you quote, can't like consider

97
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,080
your life without like that is a blessing because you don't have to deal with that other shit

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,880
anymore. So here's what you do. You vampire it. Oh boy. No, no, no. Cause here's what I mean.

99
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,960
You need to then you and your partner hang out with these new young couples and just kind of

100
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,480
feed off their like little looks between the two of you and little handholds when it's like, I

101
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,640
remember when we were like that and you get that little like tiny burst of that new cute feeling.

102
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
And then you go back to your house where you already know each other well enough that you

103
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,960
don't have to deal with each other's bullshit. I need you at home to remember that cute new

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,080
relationship stuff. And this is going to sound cynical, but it isn't. It's your body. It's your

105
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:31,280
like body chemistry way of trying to trick you into procreating and deep down in your heart,

106
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,320
beneath your soul, there is a little, um, man who just wants you. He's like a dirty guy. He's like,

107
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,880
just do it. Cause he wants you to procreate and spread your species. It's a deepest,

108
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,200
most primal impulse you have. His name is Charles Darwin and he's a dirty bird. It's

109
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Charles Darwin. He lives in your heart and he's a dirty bird cause he wants you to just do it. Skip

110
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,680
all this relationship stuff. Just do it. Spread the virus of humanity. This feeling that this new

111
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,600
relationship feeling is really just like a, it's like a no interest loan to get you in to and

112
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,160
custom, uh, relationship car. It's there, there you're, it's just a way to suck you in. It suckers

113
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,320
you in. And then the important stuff is the fact that you have a friend and somebody who

114
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,680
supports you and somebody you care a lot about and somebody who's a great match for you.

115
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,960
And a lot of that like new relationship stuff doesn't have to worry about any of that. Like

116
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,280
it's a, you're free wheeling like, so yeah, it's, it's, it's, um, cute, but it's also

117
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,040
insubstantial, right? You know, because it doesn't, you, it doesn't have the bedrock.

118
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,200
It doesn't have anything built underneath it. And I, and I can understand the, the missing that

119
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:56,400
feeling, but like two things. First off, don't, I have known so many people who have traded in really

120
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,120
great relationships for a taste of that feeling again. Um, and, and, and that's not to say that

121
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't feel like romantic love towards my wife every single day and, and find a new reason why,

122
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,400
uh, I love her more than anything. Listen, she cut, listen to the show. I got to cover my fucking

123
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,360
bases. When you've been married seven years, Justin said, I mean it too for mine. I love my wife more

124
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,840
and more every day. Like all the grains in the, of sand, that's where she carried you. Anyway, I,

125
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,760
I've seen people trade in great relationships for a taste of that feeling. You got to remember that

126
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,240
once you get to be my age, the number of feelings that you won't feel anymore from youth pile up so

127
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,600
much that that one's just another one for the sack. Just throw it on the fire. I don't remember,

128
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,320
there's a lot of things I used to feel that I don't feel anymore because I'm old. I'm an old

129
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,960
man. I know it's not, that's the, you'll trust, you'll just get lost in the shuffle, but I think

130
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,880
it could be a really destructive, it could be a really destructive impulse. Um, another, and this,

131
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,840
and you know, this is going to get into like boring, like normal relationship advice crap,

132
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,280
so I won't dwell on it, but, uh, a great way to sort of get a semblance of this feeling about

133
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,960
back is to put you and your significant other into a new relationship. I mean, I think we've

134
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,160
seen it time and time again, perhaps in Steve Carell vehicle date night, when you're thrust into

135
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,760
a unfamiliar circumstance, you discover new stuff about the person you're with and something like

136
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,800
that is, is, is, uh, you know, sort of what that new relationship smell is generating.

137
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You always got to find his one weakness. You always got to pick on his one fucking slip up

138
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,920
and never, I'm talking about you, Justin, and your relationship with Steve Carell.

139
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I accidentally bring up, uh, the incredible Burt Wonderstone?

140
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,160
Also, you are always writing his, even his fucking grill.

141
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
B stringers are better than most people's A material.

142
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,080
You've got a fucking timeshare in Steve, Steve Carell's grill and it's fucking shameful. What

143
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:14,880
have you done? You know what I mean? Did you, I mean, did, did you see Evan Almighty? I mean,

144
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,000
did you, I watched it on a plane. It gave me diarrhea guys. We kick stuff off. It looked

145
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,240
like full blown Dr. Rue style. I don't know if that's the pace that we usually, I got Dr. I

146
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,480
hope that helped. I watched the, we watched the episode of quantum leap yesterday in season five,

147
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,320
I think like ep eight where Sam Beckett jumps into Dr. Ruth. This is not a joke. This is an

148
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,600
actual episode of quantum leap. Um, it is the craziest hour of television I think I've ever

149
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
watched in my entire life because Dr. Ruth is an imaging chamber hanging out with Al Calvici in

150
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,360
real life and like helping him deal with his sexual childishness, let's call it.

151
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,400
And there's like a full quantum leap, just like jump the shark episode two.

152
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,680
Yeah. And then it just stayed, it hovered over the shark like Chris Angel mind freak the entire

153
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,320
time. There's like a two minute segment where they're dealing with the fact that Al Calvici

154
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,520
can't say the word breasts because he's such a sexual child. And instead he has to say like

155
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:24,480
bazongas, balloons, beepers, boppos, weep, weeps, Jim Jim's slappers. And that episode one, two

156
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,160
Emmys for best boobs, best nicknames for breasts by Al Calvici. Wow. Train wreck.

157
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,720
Is that on Netflix? It's on Netflix and it's on Hulu. You're going to want to watch it on Hulu

158
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
because they don't have all the episodes on Netflix, including the one where Sam leaps

159
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,200
into Lee Harvey Oswald. That's the best. It's the fucking best. You guys want Yahoo? Yeah. Thanks

160
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,960
everybody for sending in your Yahoo's. We burned through a lot of them because we did the, uh,

161
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,080
we did the bonus episode with our dad, which you can listen to now if you are a donor. Uh,

162
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,760
and if you're not, you're about to be cause we're kicking off the max fun drive next week. Uh,

163
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,080
more deets on that soon. Uh, but this Yahoo was sent in by, uh, Amelie Belcher. Thanks Amelie.

164
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,880
It's by Yahoo answers user. What was that? It's right next to the Amelie from the movie Amelie.

165
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:24,240
Amelie. Cause she just walks around in person. You just, it's about a young girl who can only

166
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,880
say her own name. I cook an egg with a spoon. Amelie. Jesus. She cooks an egg with a spoon.

167
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,720
Fall in love again with me. Amelie. Now on DVD.

168
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:45,600
You missed that new relationships, but maybe fall in love with me. Don't look for me on

169
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Blu-ray. I'm not on Blu-ray. I'm on my DVD. I'm too small to fit on the Blu-ray. They lose me.

170
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,200
I am Amelie. I'm hiding near the spindle. I am Amelie.

171
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:09,440
I'm hiding near the spindle. I am Amelie. This laser disc is gigantic. I am on the edge of it.

172
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:19,360
Hello. It is like a plate for my egg dinner. Delicious. I am Amelie.

173
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,040
I am inside your pocket. You have enough money to buy my DVD.

174
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,000
You have to stop or it'll be the whole show.

175
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm in VHS tapes because I would get in the little holes and spin around.

176
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Is Amelie a borrower? What's going on?

177
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,680
Yes, I live in a home with a mice king. I'm married to the mice king. My staff is a lollipop, Amelie.

178
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:03,920
Thank you. Oh, Christ. Give me a second. All right. Thank you, Amelie Belcher. This is by

179
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:12,400
Yahoo Answers user Erica, who asks, I want to give up Taco Bell for Lint.

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,600
For Kent, nice start. I was thinking about giving up Taco Bell since I am obsessed with it.

181
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,520
But I ate Taco Bell on Ash Wednesday, then later that night decided to give it up.

182
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,880
But since I decided after, does it still count or should I give up something else?

183
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,920
You have to double give it up. Now, how would that happen?

184
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,200
You have to give it up and then steal it from someone else and throw it away.

185
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
Oh, but that's just thievery. It's not. Yeah, you got to rob and hood the Taco Bell.

186
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,040
You got to rob from the rich and give to the garbage.

187
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,480
Travis, the problem with your plan is that it's not very sustainable.

188
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
How's that? We're good.

189
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you want to be the top, first of all, taco burglar, you're going to get in.

190
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,360
A pretty serious trademark dispute with McDonald's.

191
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,520
What about the gordita grabber?

192
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,880
Gordita grabber. Yeah, sure. That's totally kosher.

193
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
Gordito bandito.

194
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
Can someone explain to me Lint?

195
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
You give stuff up and you feel bad because Jesus gave stuff up.

196
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,800
You give stuff up and you feel bad because Jesus gave stuff up.

197
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:33,600
I know that there's a shit ton of places that do fish. They get super fish.

198
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,840
I think BK is running some ads now where it's like,

199
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,160
we got all the fish sandwiches your Catholic mouth can possibly eat.

200
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
So is it while Lint is going on, you're also not supposed to eat meat and only fish?

201
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,520
Because if that's the case, then yeah, Taco Bell, probably not for you.

202
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
I do not think they have.

203
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
It's on Fridays. You're just supposed to eat fish, fish Fridays.

204
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,680
On Lint or across the calendar?

205
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
No, that I do not know.

206
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,680
No, just during Lint, you're not supposed to eat serious meat on Fridays, I think.

207
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
If I'm not mistaken, that is because back in the day,

208
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,440
England had this huge surplus of fish and they needed to keep their fish.

209
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm not even joking that they're fishing, but I know you're not joking.

210
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,120
That's what makes it funny is that our world is the fucking dumbest.

211
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
Fishing boats were also the Navy and they had to keep the fishing boats employed

212
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,440
so they could keep their Navy afloat.

213
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,320
So it's your old pal Sal Pescalito, your local fisherman.

214
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,440
Hey, I just found a new missing page of the Bible.

215
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Like I found it blown around in the street like Bart's nightmare.

216
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,240
Let me tell you, it says that Jesus loves fish on Fridays.

217
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
Huge fan.

218
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
Huge, huge fan.

219
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
Trust me, I'm Sal Pescalito.

220
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,960
I remembered my name from when I said it a minute ago.

221
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,720
Which is really the greatest feat Griffin McElroy's ever done on this show.

222
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,680
It's a Lint miracle.

223
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
I've been waiting to reference Bart's nightmare for three years now.

224
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,240
And that is the series finale of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

225
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
Okay, Taco Bell.

226
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
I mean, here's the thing.

227
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,800
Here's a little Lint secret.

228
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,320
Have you guys ever given anything up for Lint?

229
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Can we address that first and foremost?

230
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Maybe in high school and all your friends were doing it.

231
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
We don't do Lint.

232
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
No, I know, but like you didn't like all your friends were doing it in high school.

233
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,640
You were like, you know what?

234
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,360
I am too.

235
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,320
In college, we gave up fast food, but that was like a more of like an excuse for weight

236
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
loss thing more than it was any kind of religious.

237
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
And then what we did is we did not eat fast food for 40 days.

238
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,600
And then on the 41st day, fucking took it to everything.

239
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,960
We drove an hour and a half to the closest Jack in the box and like just loaded up the

240
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,600
vehicle with fast food, drove home and had like a three hour feast of fast food.

241
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
And then we all died.

242
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
Yeah, now it tries to go.

243
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,960
So if you're going to do a Lint thing and you really want to do it for a month and some

244
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,080
change, then it's got to be something you can realistically go without for a month and

245
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,560
some change.

246
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,640
So in that regard, don't, I don't think this is a good idea because of course you're

247
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,600
going to eat Taco Bell.

248
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
You have to, you'll die.

249
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
You'll die if you don't.

250
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
I think if your special thing that you gave up for Lint to really prove your devotion

251
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
to the big guy is Taco Bell.

252
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,520
He is already so thoroughly unimpressed with you that like he's not going to get out the

253
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,040
calendar and double check you.

254
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,400
Yeah, it's fine.

255
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
You're trying your best.

256
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,920
You clearly, you know, are giving it your best shot.

257
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,800
Do you say you're going to give something up for Lint?

258
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,760
What would it be?

259
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,320
It's odd.

260
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,360
It has been so obvious to me since the very beginning.

261
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,400
There is only one thing that makes sense to give up for Lint and that's candy because

262
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
it ends on Easter.

263
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,080
Oh, so you are just, oh, like you're, you have preserved your candy virginity.

264
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,680
You are like the taste of the succulent taste.

265
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,920
What?

266
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,720
You're washed.

267
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,760
I mean, you're washed clean and you're born again.

268
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,800
Candy virginity.

269
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,360
It's your second chance at candy virginity.

270
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,240
Patched your candy.

271
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
Your second gummy cherry.

272
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
Oh, yes.

273
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,280
Thank you.

274
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:31,280
And then once that big, beautiful bunny comes to your house and leaves you with that

275
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,760
treasure, he takes your candy virginity.

276
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
It is going to be the best candy you've ever eaten.

277
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,680
And God is going to be like, you see, you did it.

278
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I got you back and I'm so proud.

279
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,120
I invented jelly beans.

280
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,280
The intent was always for people to give up candy for Lint.

281
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,080
That's always what God intended for you to give up.

282
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,240
That's why he made the Easter bunny from Adam's foot.

283
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
Did they have, wow.

284
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
That's, that's a hundred percent biblical scholar Justin McElroy.

285
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,600
I think, did they have candy back in Bethlehem days?

286
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah, it was probably shitty.

287
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
It was like dried salted fish.

288
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,400
I was going to say, yeah, it's like figs that they tried to jam in the shape of gummy bears.

289
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,840
Like, hey kids, we invented candy.

290
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,560
No, you didn't.

291
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,640
Don't try to get ahead of me.

292
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
I know I'm only 10, but that's, I know a fig when I see one.

293
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,280
It's like one of two foods that we had.

294
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,160
It's figs and bread.

295
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,680
That's all we got.

296
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,160
We haven't even figured out how you can eat the fish yet.

297
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
What a great day that's going to be.

298
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880
Only on Fridays though.

299
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
Friday sucked dick.

300
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,440
Friday sucked dick.

301
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
We can't eat anything.

302
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,600
I think back in those days, I think back in those days, like the sacrifices were so much,

303
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
like I gave up furniture.

304
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
I gave up furniture for Lint.

305
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,160
I gave up standing up.

306
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,280
You only had like six things that you could do.

307
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,560
You had furniture, dates, bread, cocaine.

308
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,280
Your habit of trying to figure out a way to eat fish.

309
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, I don't know.

310
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
Your obsession with the pursuit of edible fish.

311
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,400
Just grab the head and the tail and just bite it somewhere.

312
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
I don't know.

313
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
Why does it have this armor on the outside of it?

314
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,800
These are disgusting.

315
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
I gave up scorpions.

316
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,360
There are not a lot of foods that so willfully try to dissuade you from eating them.

317
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,280
You think about fish for a second.

318
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,560
Fish is covered in inedible, hard to remove little pieces of chitin.

319
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:38,080
And then once you get inside and finally find the meat, it's got razor sharp tiny thin bones.

320
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,040
That are invisible.

321
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,320
Invisible to the human eye.

322
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,080
If there's ever been a clear signal that we're not supposed to eat that, I don't know what it is.

323
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,760
Maybe the blowfish that has the poison in it.

324
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
That was that was one that Jeezu like really tried.

325
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,720
Like guys, get the fucking net.

326
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,080
Get it.

327
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
You're not supposed to eat these.

328
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,920
But on Friday the poison is nullified.

329
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,880
I don't know if you knew that.

330
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
Every Friday, Fugu Friday.

331
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Just like swallow it whole, baby.

332
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,440
Let it roll.

333
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,120
I think I might have made that thing up about the English.

334
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,520
Fish and the fish.

335
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,480
Swallow it whole.

336
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,440
Let it roll.

337
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Catholicism.

338
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,360
Another question.

339
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,000
It's a new religion.

340
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Give it another.

341
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
I need another question.

342
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,600
I'm 22 and I've been working in a manufacturing plant for about six months.

343
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,520
It's not a terrible job, but it is not what I want to be doing with my whole life.

344
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I have dreams of being a stand-up comedian.

345
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,960
I know it takes a really long time to get to a point where I can support myself solely doing

346
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,680
stand-up.

347
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
If I ever get to that point at all.

348
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,560
Brothers, how do I keep myself motivated at my current job while simultaneously pursuing

349
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,280
my dream?

350
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,480
Ambitious in Ohio.

351
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Roman Mars gave me some amazing advice recently.

352
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,840
And I said that, you know, I was interested in doing like sketch comedy, but I felt like

353
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,560
I was too old.

354
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,520
And I said, how old is too old?

355
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,920
And he said, do you know how old you'll be when you're successful at it?

356
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,160
The same age you'll be if you don't try.

357
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,480
And it's like, okay, excellent point.

358
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,160
It's like that idea of like.

359
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,880
That dude is like, everything he says is super on point.

360
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,520
Yeah.

361
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Can you imagine if like one of us were like that?

362
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,520
Like how much better this show would be?

363
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,480
It would be really good.

364
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,920
When he's, when he said, like when you read that, did you hear like an ambient soundscape

365
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,880
behind his words?

366
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Cause like, I don't think I could talk when I, when I saw him at max fun con, I couldn't

367
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,280
talk to him unless I started some sort of a lovely ambient soundscape.

368
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,360
He actually just carries a tablet with him.

369
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,800
That's full of ambient sounds.

370
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
And just when you start talking, he's like, hold up a finger.

371
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,120
He's like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

372
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,400
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

373
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
And he hits you.

374
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,000
You hear like, man, you're.

375
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,320
99% invisible.

376
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,840
He's a robot.

377
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,720
Now what he's at.

378
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
Roman Mars is also a robot.

379
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,040
Uh, now the, uh, the question is not whether I should try what he's saying is how does

380
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:16,000
he stay motivated in his current job while pursuing his dream while pursuing his dream?

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,720
You know, the thing is, I think the thing is though, like you can always find like,

382
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm sure there's an open mic night somewhere near you, you know?

383
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,360
And if nothing else, when you're at work, write jokes in your head, you know what I

384
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,600
mean?

385
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,480
And then write them down on your break and then do what Steve Martin did and stand in

386
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,640
front of your mirror for hours on end and practice your jokes and hone your craft and

387
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,560
figure out the best delivery.

388
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,920
And you know, I tell you what, the only thing that ever kept me, uh, invested in like, uh,

389
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,760
non mentally taxing gigs, let's say that, uh, the only thing that ever kept me invested.

390
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,560
And this is a good lesson for like, um, people who run a business too and have their own

391
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,440
employees.

392
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,760
The only thing that ever kept me invested was ownership.

393
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,160
Um, when I would be given ownership of something, whatever it was, that was something that would

394
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,840
invest me a lot more into the gig.

395
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,880
So like when I was working at Best Buy, for example, I would try to sell karaoke machines

396
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:27,280
by, uh, doing karaoke there to the delight, I assume, of all the customers.

397
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,440
Uh, and you know, everybody would take a turn and it was fun, but it was my project.

398
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,960
It was something I came up with.

399
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,800
We only had like two machines for sale.

400
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm pretty sure we never sold any, but I-

401
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,040
So not a great thing you did.

402
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,480
So when you say you tried, what you mean is you didn't try killing time by jerking off

403
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
with a karaoke machine.

404
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,320
No, it's less about the, it's less about the impact on sales and more about the impact

405
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,880
on myself as an employee because I felt more invested in my gig because I had ownership

406
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,120
of something.

407
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,800
But you weren't doing anything.

408
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
You were just singing karaoke.

409
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,280
You weren't selling the machines.

410
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,240
That wasn't the only part of my job that was impacted.

411
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,560
My whole attitude towards the gig changed.

412
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,840
And I would take on other, like just decide this is your section.

413
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,600
This is the thing that you're going to crush and you're going to be responsible for it.

414
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,160
It's your baby.

415
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,200
And it's not juice, can I tell you?

416
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,560
It sounds like you really killed it.

417
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,920
Thanks Griffin.

418
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,840
I think I did a really good job.

419
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
Those were, those are not high margin items anyway.

420
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Selling one wouldn't have made that big of an impact.

421
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,080
This guy works in manufacturing though, which I think is like a gig that is specifically

422
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,920
designed to crush those kinds of feelings with like an iron Orwellian fist.

423
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,040
Like I'm taking charge of this one nut that I put on this one door.

424
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,520
Then you do something that is not related to your job.

425
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,120
Take it, start a softball team, take ownership of it.

426
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
Buy a ping pong table.

427
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
Don't buy a ping pong table.

428
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,800
How about take ownership of your stand up comedy career?

429
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,960
He's asking about, listen, Travis, if you one more time try to tell this guy how to

430
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,040
pursue a stand up comedy career when that is not his problem, I'm going to find someone

431
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,720
who's better at advice than you.

432
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,600
Let me throw this out.

433
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
I hate having to throw that out there on you.

434
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,160
I understand.

435
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,800
Good luck.

436
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,120
Let me throw this out.

437
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Open the door, yell outside.

438
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,560
Anyone want to tell me what to do?

439
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,840
Like, yep, I got you.

440
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,560
I got you.

441
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
What if you set up a reward system?

442
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,000
Cookie points.

443
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:25,200
Yeah, more or less where you say like, every time I save $100 from my manufacturing job,

444
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,640
I'll take myself out to dinner.

445
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll go see a stand up comedy show.

446
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
I'll rent a movie, whatever.

447
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,320
But just something that makes it more than just the drudgery of work.

448
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,520
Something that feels like you're building towards a goal.

449
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,320
Yeah, I mean, that is good advice, actually.

450
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,160
Oh, damn it.

451
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,400
Yeah.

452
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,280
All right, you're back.

453
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,920
You're back on.

454
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
Yeah, I did it.

455
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,520
Call my, now here's how you pursue your stand up comedy.

456
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,240
God damn it.

457
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,520
No, wait, no.

458
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,080
I blew it.

459
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,800
I blew it.

460
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Hello, brothers.

461
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
In a few months, I am moving in with some friends of mine.

462
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,480
They already have three housemates, a couple and the lady in the couple's little brother.

463
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,120
Yes.

464
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,400
No, that sentence made sense to the people who heard it, but not to the person who said

465
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,880
it out loud.

466
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Okay, a couple and the lady in the couple's little brother.

467
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
It's the couple and one of their little brothers.

468
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,760
Oh, the lady.

469
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,480
Okay, got it.

470
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,280
All right, got it.

471
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,400
The couple is going to India for five months, and the little brother is going to go to Thailand.

472
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Did you almost say Thailand?

473
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,320
No.

474
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,920
You're like Anthony Bourdain.

475
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,360
So world smart.

476
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
You're so savvy.

477
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,240
How do my friends and I tell the travelers that at least one of them will be essentially

478
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
homeless when they return?

479
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
That's for moving in Melbourne.

480
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,160
I don't understand.

481
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,440
Just let them get home.

482
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,320
Let them walk in.

483
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Your shit's there.

484
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,440
In a few months, you're moving in with some friends.

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
They already have three housemates.

486
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
The couple and the brother are leaving.

487
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,320
How did your friends tell the travelers that?

488
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
I don't understand.

489
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,720
Are you it seems to me that they're moving to India for five months and this dude's like

490
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
creep sneaking in to take over one of their rooms while they're gone.

491
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,400
Okay, so like that's probably not legal.

492
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,360
I don't fucking understand.

493
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,240
You can't just like you don't have squatters rights if like somebody lives there already.

494
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,880
Like if they don't know that they're not going to have a house when they get back,

495
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,560
what the fuck are you talking about?

496
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,520
Well, that's why they're trying to that's why they're trying to figure out how to tell them.

497
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,440
How crazy is it in Melbourne?

498
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,680
Like is it just a sort of a outlaw sort of system where if somebody if you leave your house

499
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
and somebody else rolls into your house, that's their house.

500
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Okay, let's mathematically let's bust this down.

501
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,280
Okay, a few months moving in with some friends of mine.

502
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,400
So we can assume that the non moving parties are more than one person will say it's two people.

503
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
They have three housemates is a big ass house.

504
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
It's got five people in it.

505
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,120
Three of the housemates are leaving for a period of time and then when they return.

506
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
They're not going to have a place to live anymore because you're moving into their house.

507
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,160
It sounds like depending on how many friends you have in that house,

508
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,280
you are evicting a majority share of the house.

509
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,000
And that's just not how like anything works.

510
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,560
You can't kick out a majority of the people in the house against their will.

511
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,600
I don't think this is like you can't just like fucking.

512
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:26,800
I think what he's saying is if one or I mean,

513
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,840
either the brother or presumably the couple isn't going to split so.

514
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,080
Ooh, make them choose.

515
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Are you saying get some pool cues, snap them over your knee,

516
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,480
throw them to him and say one of you will be evicted.

517
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Why do you say like that?

518
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,560
Oh, that's your that's your Australian accent.

519
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,040
Yeah, not good.

520
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,600
Not good.

521
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,160
Not great.

522
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,080
Throw another shrimp on the bar.

523
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,200
Terrific.

524
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,080
Fantastic.

525
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,440
Bye Australia.

526
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,480
Hey Australia.

527
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,840
Thanks for listening and supporting.

528
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,720
Oh, they know.

529
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
I've got an Australian friend.

530
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,720
I can say whatever.

531
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
Sorry, Travis thinks you sound like Orson Welles.

532
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,080
Yeah, and fat Orson Welles too.

533
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,600
You're welcome.

534
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,960
This is the fucking house of leaves of my brother.

535
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,080
My brother me questions.

536
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,840
I still don't understand the scenario.

537
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,240
Can I just suggest an answer that we have gotten more,

538
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,240
leaned on more frequently, I think, in our twilight years.

539
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,840
Just tell them.

540
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Just tell them and sit and use your word and just tell them.

541
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,520
Can I role play this though?

542
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll be, you be the person telling and I will be the parties that are moving away for a while.

543
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,080
Crikey, Jim.

544
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,960
Okay, start over.

545
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,160
I'm sorry to have-

546
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
Do try again.

547
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,040
Okay, start over.

548
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,640
Garblimey, Governor.

549
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,360
Nailed it.

550
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,160
I have some bad news for you.

551
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,520
Okay, I'm listening.

552
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,120
When you're moving out, it's gonna be really hard for us to sustain rent.

553
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,920
Oh, we're not moving out.

554
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
We're just hopping out to Australia.

555
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,160
We're gonna put, you know, feel free to sublet them, but then we're gonna get back

556
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
because we're a majority share of the people living in the house.

557
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,000
We're just gonna hop back right in there.

558
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
You bring up an excellent point, Griffin.

559
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Are they planning on paying rent for the five months they're gone?

560
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,920
See, I would like to suggest, I would like to make a motion to table, reason being that

561
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,200
we do not have enough information to accurately and professionally solve this problem.

562
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,160
Seconded.

563
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,480
Sorry.

564
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,120
Seconded.

565
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
All those in favor, say aye.

566
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,360
Aye.

567
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,320
Aye.

568
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,760
All those opposed?

569
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,320
I abstain.

570
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,600
Motion passes.

571
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,240
I abstain until marriage.

572
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,360
Until marriage.

573
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Let's get paid.

574
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,240
March is National Start Your Business Month.

575
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,200
All right.

576
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,400
Listen.

577
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,560
And April is National Finish This Business Month.

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,480

You love standup comedy.

580
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,240
It's time to start your business.

581
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,400
Don't worry about the numbers.

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,920

I don't know if you need to do that,

615
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,760
but my brother and LegalZoom, start that business.

616
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,400
You're worth it.

617
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,960
Kick it off.

618
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,360
Guys, my brother, My Brother and Me

619
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,120
is also supported by Warby Parker,

620
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,800
which is a new concept in eyewear.

621
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,760
Glasses are expensive in most cases.

622
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,560
I just actually, I bought some glasses like a dumb-o

623
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:12,480
and it cost me $600 million, like after evil.

624
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,040
Borat.

625
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,640
Are you telling me you got rid of the Randy Jackson shades?

626
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,360
The Randy Jackson shades were apparently my prescription

627
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,720
and those particular frame-os were like ancient

628
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
because I went to a doctor and he's like,

629
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,880
let me try this.

630
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,680
And I was like, oh, shades.

631
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
You could suddenly see through the wall.

632
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
I remember shapes, sure.

633
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
So yeah, I got rid of those.

634
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,280
I got rid of those Randy Jacksons.

635
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,240
I got Lucky Brand, like the jeans, and they're cool.

636
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,840
I think they look all right, but on the inside,

637
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,640
it says Lucky You, which I also have a pair of jeans

638
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,440
that say that on the zipper when you unzip them.

639
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,640
So like, if you're getting into the act of intimacy

640
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,440
and then it's like a little banner that's like,

641
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,600
hey, I'm a douche nozzle.

642
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,640
Anyway, that was a very long-

643
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't be a fuck-up like Griffin.

644
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,320
Don't be a fuck-up.

645
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
I fuck up so hard.

646
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Go to Warby Parker and you can get

647
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,200
Fashion Forward Prescriptione glasses

648
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,800
that start at $95.

649
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,640
What?

650
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,600
Yeah, and they include anti-reflective, anti-glare coating.

651
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,520
I did pay extra for those on my stupid ass douche glasses.

652
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,080
And that $95 includes the prescription.

653
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,240
Includes the prescription, includes the frames,

654
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,280
includes the anti-reflective and anti-glare coating,

655
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
which you should use if you use a computer a lot.

656
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
But now here's the, like, let me give you the,

657
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,520
let me give you the big best thing about Warby Parker,

658
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,440
the thing that Griffin really fucked up.

659
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,120
They have a home try-on program.

660
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,440
They'll go to send you five pairs of glasses

661
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,280
to right to your house.

662
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,120
You try them on, you pick the ones you want,

663
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,560
preferably the ones that don't say Lucky You on the inside.

664
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,120
And then you send them back, the ones you don't want back.

665
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,280
You don't, are not obligated to buy anything.

666
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,880
It's like a gift for you.

667
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,080
They also have prescription polarized sunglasses for $150.

668
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,560
No big deal.

669
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
Just finally protect your eyes.

670
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,320
That's a great deal because what I had to do

671
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,480
was go to the glasses store, buy myself,

672
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,480
put on glasses and take pictures of myself discreetly

673
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,640
using my phone and then send them to my wife saying,

674
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
do these make me look like an asshole?

675
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,080
We've all been there.

676
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,480
I did the same thing the last time I tried on stupid glasses.

677
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,040
Boy, do I love taking pictures of myself in public.

678
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Don't do that.

679
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,680
Go to Warby Parker.

680
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
If you go to warbyparker.com slash my brother,

681
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,560
you can get free three-day shipping

682
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,120
on your five home try-on frames, which is crazy.

683
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,440
So go to that warbyparker.com slash my brother,

684
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,720
all one word, and don't embarrass yourself in public.

685
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,520
Got a message for Alita from Will.

686
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
Alita says, you filled, oh, this seems like a song,

687
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,200
but I'm gonna try my best.

688
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,000
There's definitely-

689
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,600
No, do it like a beat poet.

690
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,920
Okay.

691
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,640
Can you guys give me some beats?

692
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,760
You know that that's not what beat poets do.

693
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,720
Yeah, it comes in between.

694
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,640
You filled me with such love and joy

695
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,520
since before I got a one knee.

696
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,560
Marriage to you is greater still.

697
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
How we were meant to be.

698
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,560
This year, we made discoveries like UU and D&D.

699
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,480
Commitments that strengthened ours

700
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,320
and brought you closer to me.

701
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,040
I know not what next year will bring.

702
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,400
Sights that we will see, but I don't care.

703
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,560
Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a heart.

704
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,480
So that's the end of it.

705
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,840
I assume she didn't have enough room to make up the last rhyme.

706
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,440
So, but I don't care.

707
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,480
You're my snuggle bear.

708
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,880
I'll just write that for Alita.

709
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,360
So I'm glad you guys are in love.

710
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,320
That makes me very happy.

711
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,240
Alita and Will, and I hope you have many more to come.

712
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
Travis, do we have any other messages?

713
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,160
We do for Tommy S.

714
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
It's from Claire S.

715
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,440
It's a special birthday wish.

716
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm hoping the McElroy brothers will gift to you

717
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,680
a new term of endearment.

718
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,000
You've had the same one since 2002

719
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,480
and only their collective genii can replace it with something better.

720
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,640
Genii, it's the plural of genitalia.

721
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,240
Yeah, I see.

722
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
I love you so much and look forward to the next 150 birthdays together.

723
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,920
P.S. Let's make a baby.

724
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,420
Boom.

725
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,400
What is-

726
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:20,900
Whoa.

727
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,200
Why are we booming?

728
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,240
And then it says, Dear McElroy brothers, please help with a new-

729
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,160
And then it's cut off, so I don't know.

730
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
I'm assuming it's new baby.

731
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,720
A new baby.

732
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:30,960
All right.

733
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,600
I can give you some-

734
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,560
Okay, so here's what you're gonna need to do.

735
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,720
Here's how that all works.

736
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,640
New term of endearment.

737
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,000
New term of endearment.

738
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,500
What's-

739
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:40,800
Baby maker.

740
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,300
What's the name?

741
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,960
Claire S.

742
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,840
How about this?

743
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,400
Claire's.

744
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,560
No, it's for Tommy.

745
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,280
No, we're looking for Tommy though.

746
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, it's for Tommy.

747
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,580
Shit.

748
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,160
No, but call him Claire.

749
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,120
How about that?

750
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,600
What about-

751
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,100
Tommy's.

752
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,240
King baby maker.

753
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,380
Uh-huh.

754
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,880
What about prince?

755
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,560
Prince is too much.

756
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,600
Baby hose.

757
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,400
Squidgy face.

758
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,720
Rummy tummy tom tom.

759
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,040
No.

760
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,960
Rummy tummy tom tom is very good.

761
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,520
Tommy gun.

762
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,580
Tommy gun.

763
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,280
That's what everyone knows.

764
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,880
Like the porn star?

765
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,380
Yeah.

766
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,200
I think Tommy gun's a box-

767
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,160
Tommy touch a lot.

768
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,920
Tommy toucher.

769
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,000
Tommy toucher.

770
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Touchable Tom.

771
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,040
Ricky ticky Tommy.

772
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,440
Earl Ray Tomblin.

773
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,560
The Tommiest.

774
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,680
The Who's Tommy.

775
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,720
Yes, the Who's Tommy.

776
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,680
That will be fine.

777
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
This wasn't an expensive message.

778
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,560
The Who's Tommy is good enough for this, I think.

779
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:34,960
Wonderful.

780
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I still think Rummy tummy tom Thomas.

781
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,880
Well, you have many options that you can choose from at your discretion.

782
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,120
So please enjoy them.

783
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
Hello, I'm Judge John Hodgman.

784
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,880
And I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn.

785
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,520
Can you force your girlfriend to listen to heavy metal music?

786
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,080
Is a machine gun a robot?

787
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,280
Is it okay to take coupons out of the garbage if you're Canadian?

788
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,360
What should you do if your parrot attacks your husband?

789
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,560
Can you prove that Crank 2 is a good movie?

790
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,160
Only one man can decide.

791
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Judge John Hodgman.

792
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,080
If you have a case for the judge's court, visit Maximumfun.org

793
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,080
slash JJ Ho.

If you just want to listen in, find us on the web or free in iTunes.

795
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,640
My boyfriend and I look extremely alike with pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes.

796
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,840
Everyone knew we automatically assumes we're brother and sister.

797
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,680
We've been dating for almost two years.

798
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,920
However, this problem still hasn't gone away.

799
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,640
How do we crush the assumption that we're siblings without having to explain to everyone

800
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,600
beforehand that we're in a relationship?

801
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,760
That's a good one.

802
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,080
When I was in college once, I went to 7-Eleven with a girlfriend at the time.

803
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,880
And we were getting some Slurpees.

804
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,840
And we got the Slurpees, we took them up to the register.

805
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,600
And the guy inexplicably went, are y'all brother and sister?

806
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,400
And we're like, no, we're not.

807
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,520
We're boyfriend and girlfriend.

808
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,080
We're dating.

809
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,880
And he felt so bad that he gave us our Slurpees for free.

810
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,560
So I guess this story-

811
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
Why would he just volunteer that judgment?

812
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,540
Right.

813
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,080
I guess this whole story is to say you shouldn't.

814
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,400
You can maybe turn this into free Slurpees.

815
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,480
This could be worse.

816
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,120
You could actually be brother and sister.

817
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,880
Or they could think you're like mom and son.

818
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,400
I have never-

819
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,320
And I don't think there's any exception to this.

820
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,320
I have never gone to a restaurant with my wife.

821
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,440
Because she's a much more attractive human than I am.

822
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,720
I've never gone to a restaurant with my wife.

823
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,600
Categorically and objectively.

824
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,080
Yes.

825
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,360
In every respect.

826
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,160
I have never-

827
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,960
Intellectually.

828
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,560
I've never-

829
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,440
Financially.

830
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,640
Not been asked, are you two together?

831
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,360
Are these separate checks?

832
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,960
Never not been asked.

833
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,320
Is that true?

834
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,160
I have to imagine the assumption that she is in some way my caregiver.

835
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,200
That that is the relationship that we share.

836
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
That it could not be a romantic one.

837
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,480
Somewhere the waiters are going,

838
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,120
how long does big brothers, big sisters last?

839
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,440
Yeah.

840
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,000
Because at some point they grow up and you stop hanging out with them, right?

841
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
This is a wicked big brother at this point.

842
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,440
Wait, this brother is aged.

843
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,240
Biggest brothers, biggest sisters.

844
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
So it could be worse.

845
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,760
I mean, the obvious answer is you just dye your hair, right?

846
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,120
Something fun.

847
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,680
Who does it though?

848
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,720
Get a full face touch.

849
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,240
How do you decide who does it?

850
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,680
You both have to do it.

851
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,000
That's the deal with the devil you're gonna make.

852
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,960
But like dye their hair the same color?

853
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
No, one of you go red, one of you go blue.

854
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Someone's getting the short end of that stick.

855
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,280
Yeah.

856
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
Well, maybe that would go great with one of their looks.

857
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,960
I don't know.

858
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,720
How about like homemade t-shirts?

859
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,520
Not his brother?

860
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,760
Yeah.

861
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,640
You say that?

862
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah.

863
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah, but then you gotta wear the same shirt every day.

864
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,440
Who is asking you about this?

865
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I can see like if you meet new people,

866
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,480
some of them being like,

867
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,920
so are you two brothers?

868
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,200
You know, like, I don't know.

869
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,400
No, see, like I told that delightful Slurpee anecdote,

870
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,600
but like outside of that, this has literally never happened

871
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,560
to me before.

872
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,880
Nobody ever, because everybody's fucking bad at this.

873
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,840
Everybody knows how bad they are at this.

874
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,160
Nobody would say that.

875
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,880
Nobody would guess.

876
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,120
It's like a faux pas on the level of like,

877
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,320
hey, when's the baby due?

878
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,680
Like you don't fucking say it.

879
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,720
You don't say that shit.

880
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,480
Here's an idea.

881
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,440
When you meet new people,

882
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,200
when you're being introduced to them,

883
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,320
and someone says like,

884
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,960
hey, Steve, come over here and meet my two friends,

885
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,480
immediately start making out.

886
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,960
Just like hardcore.

887
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,400
So that way, either Steve is going to safely assume

888
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,760
that you are not brother and sister,

889
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,680
or Steve is still going to assume that you're brother

890
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
and sister and be real freaked out.

891
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,740
Maybe.

892
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,360
Or maybe Steve's down.

893
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,920
Listen, I don't want to judge Steve at this point.

894
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,440
I don't know what Steve's into.

895
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,800
Hey, I don't want to label it.

896
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,000
You know, that's Steve's life.

897
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,320
I haven't lived his life.

898
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,120
I haven't been there.

899
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,040
I don't know what he's seen or done.

900
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,400
I just can't believe in 2014 that this is an issue.

901
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,440
The people are still this presumptuous.

902
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,840
I know.

903
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,960
That's crazy to me.

904
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,200
Yeah, it seems a little nutty to me too.

905
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,840
I mean, I guess you could just introduce her,

906
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,280
or him or her as your partner in smooching.

907
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,240
Do you guys want Yahoo?

908
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,740
I guess.

909
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,820
Okay.

910
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,520
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

911
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,320
Are you Ira Ray?

912
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,360
Who wants to know?

913
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,240
Thank you, Ira Ray.

914
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

915
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, didgeridooed, who asks.

916
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,680
Pretty good.

917
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,000
Nice.

918
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,920
Why won't they let me play the didgeridoo

919
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,880
as part of the band for our church choir on Sundays?

920
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,640
Wait, hold on.

921
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,200
Is this a dude who identifies himself

922
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,760
purely based on his didgeridoo skills?

923
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,480
Or it is a sentient didgeridoo.

924
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,600
Why won't they let me play myself?

925
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,120
Pastor says, can't play with myself no more.

926
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,800
This is an important question.

927
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm sorry, Griffin, one more time.

928
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,240
Why won't they let me play the didgeridoo

929
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,160
as part of the band for our church on Sundays,

930
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,360
our church choir on Sundays?

931
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,760
It would be super dope.

932
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,280
Period.

933
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,760
That's it.

934
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,240
Yeah.

935
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,800
That would be-

936
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,160
To hear like Amazing Grace and every so often just like-

937
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,120
Our God is an awesome God.

938
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,000
Our God is an awesome God.

939
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
He reigns from-

940
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
It just sounds like the beginning of Survivor every time.

941
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,840
That'd be so dope.

942
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,760
Listen, churches are trying to get like fucking hip

943
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,600
with the kids, especially with their music.

944
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,960
Cause it's like easy to just like,

945
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,000
hey, we have an electric guitar.

946
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,960
We're basically Switchfoot.

947
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,640
I think there's a lot of alternative percussion

948
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,280
going on there.

949
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,120
A lot of gym-

950
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,440
Every church now has a didgeridoo, a rain stick.

951
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,160
A didge, a jimp, a jimb, a jim-bay, a rain stick,

952
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,600
a glockenspiel, and hand bells.

953
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,280
And that's it.

954
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,000
And that's it.

955
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,720
And they make beautiful-

956
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,760
It's a ragtag group.

957
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,080
You would think no way that good music comes out of that.

958
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,640
But then they win the church band competition

959
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,360
and they save the rec center.

960
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,880
Justin, are you-

961
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,280
I'm missing-

962
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,320
I'm mixing a lot of genres.

963
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,040
You're being very quiet.

964
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,040
Are you Googling didgeridoo or-

965
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,280
No, I know what a didgeridoo is.

966
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,680
It's only in front.

967
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,840
I just guess I don't understand the question really.

968
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,920
Is there something inherently sinful about the didgeridoo,

969
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,520
I guess is the question.

970
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,320
It's phallic.

971
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,040
It is extremely phallic and you do put your mouth on it.

972
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,680
And I do not think that that is something that they would

973
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,360
appreciate at the front of the congregation.

974
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,320
But they let Ms. Margaret play her oboe in the church band.

975
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,400
That's the most phallic instrument there is.

976
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,360
It's got foreskin.

977
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,600
I have seen people play didgeridoo in public before.

978
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,280
And every time-

979
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,160
They should be ashamed.

980
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,960
Every time I see it, I have exactly one question.

981
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,080
It's always the same question.

982
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,640
What are you trying to prove?

983
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,840
That they can play didgeridoo well?

984
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,880
Check this out.

985
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,160
You said I can't play didgeridoo,

986
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,440
but I can prove you wrong right now.

987
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,000
Categorically.

988
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,760
We all do very good dig impressions, I think.

989
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,240
If I'm not mistaken, I think that you play a didgeridoo

990
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,280
by putting your mouth on it

991
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,000
and making didgeridoo sounds through it.

992
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,440
Just put your mouth on it and go-

993
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,600
It's just a tube that you make didgeridoo noises into.

994
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,320
I play didgeridoo with this cardboard tube.

995
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,800
Do you remember that book we used to have as kids?

996
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,040
A hundred household items that you could-

997
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,120
Hey kids, turn these household items into digs.

998
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,280
Got that from the library.

999
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,720
It was a fun rainy day activity.

1000
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,520
Toilet paper rolls.

1001
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,040
Your hands.

1002
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,360
Paper towel rolls.

1003
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,640
Wrapping paper rolls.

1004
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,120
Saran wrap rolls.

1005
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,840
Biscuit tins when you take the biscuits out.

1006
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,280
Very carefully.

1007
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,360
Don't unwrap that because then you can't get a good sound.

1008
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,200
You can't dig an unwrapped biscuit roll.

1009
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,800
Stupid fucking-

1010
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
That was the sequel book, dummy.

1011
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,280
How to dig an unwrapped biscuit roll.

1012
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,480
A hundred cent process.

1013
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,000
Croissants.

1014
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,540
Croissants.

1015
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,440
Can you dig a croissant?

1016
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,560
You can- Oh baby, you ain't lived until you digged a croissant.

1017
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,960
Gotta be a big and thick one though.

1018
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,560
Gotta be a Grant's croissant.

1019
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,880
And then you burrow a little hole in there like you're making pigs in a blanket,

1020
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,280
but you're not.

1021
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,640
You're making a dig in a blanket.

1022
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,440
I once lived in a pig in a blanket.

1023
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,660
No!

1024
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,160
Me and my pig friend Porky.

1025
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,600
We live inside a tuck.

1026
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,200
Me and my dumb Amelie.

1027
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,120
Your Amelie sounds a lot like your Snowden but without a lisp.

1028
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,720
Have you noticed that?

1029
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,240
He's my brother!

1030
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,680
Do people ever think they're brother and sister?

1031
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,360
Okay, fantastic.

1032
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,600
We are brother and sister, it is true.

1033
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,040
He hides inside my heart.

1034
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,440
I once used the Amelie DVD as a dig.

1035
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,840
Not a deep- not a lot of reverb on that particular dig, but-

1036
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,360
Thank you for digging my movie!

1037
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,560
You're welcome.

1038
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,160
I didn't watch it, I just digged it.

1039
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,680
That's actually what digital distribution means.

1040
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,240
Did you know that?

1041
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,640
Yeah.

1042
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,040
Yep.

1043
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,600
It means sending a movie through a didgeridoo.

1044
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,400
It's a man who describes hit films

1045
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,880
while talking to you through a didgeridoo.

1046
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,320
And the dream is actually within the dream

1047
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,840
and then he wakes up in its fucking section.

1048
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,280
It's totally depressing, he's a slave for 12 years.

1049
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:46,320
He can say he's a free man in a door or a door or a thot.

1050
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,600
So, for the second time, they have to pretend this dead guy is alive.

1051
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,440
It's weak into Bernie's too.

1052
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,840
It's important that they ditch the name of the show.

1053
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,440
Uh, didgeridoos.

1054
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,400
We're done.

1055
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,880
We did it.

1056
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,760
We got to the end.

1057
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,400
And you made it the whole way,

1058
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,800
so you have to take some ownership of that.

1059
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,360
You listen to the whole thing and that's on you.

1060
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,960
It's my brother, my brother, and me,

1061
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
and we're so happy to be able to do it for you.

1062
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,000
Uh, every week.

1063
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,520
Next week is huge.

1064
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:25,120
It is, uh, our first of two, uh, Max Fund Drive specials.

1065
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,280
We are, uh, ramping up the Max Fund Drive.

1066
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,440
There's going to be lots of, uh, uh, awards and presents

1067
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,720
that you can get for supporting the network,

1068
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,080
plus an opportunity to help make the best podcast network

1069
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,040
in the world even better.

1070
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,000
And you're going to be able to be there for that.

1071
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,280
It's going to be a great show.

1072
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,040
We hope you will join us.

1073
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,360
We do some extra long eps.

1074
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,680
We got that bonus app for anybody who donates.

1075
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,880
We also have that catalog of, of bonus episodes.

1076
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,360
So if you haven't donated before and you give this year,

1077
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
and you start your contributions and you'll get all of that,

1078
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,280
you'll also get bonus episodes from every other show

1079
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,920
on the network.

1080
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,920
It's a pretty crazy amount of content.

1081
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,800
I think you'll get, I think there are like five,

1082
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,880
my brother, my brother, me, two.

1083
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,640
I think it's like, I think either three or four.

1084
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,200
No, because we had the Max Fund Day episodes.

1085
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,920
Oh shit.

1086
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,320
So there's five, my brother, my brother, me's.

1087
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,600
There's two with our dad.

1088
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,720
There's two riff videos that we made,

1089
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,160
like goofing on an old, like instructional,

1090
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,520
educational video.

1091
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,440
And there's actually 15 minutes of our Austin live show.

1092
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,080
Oh, that's right.

1093
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,000
And I mean, that's just us.

1094
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,520
Like every show on the network is going to have stuff

1095
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,480
like that too.

1096
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,640
Like you should also be listening to those other shows.

1097
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,920
If you're not, like Bullseye and Throwing Shade

1098
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,640
and Stop Podcasting Yourself and The Goose Down and Saw Bones,

1099
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,440
and you'll get bonus shit for all that stuff too.

1100
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,280
So just think about if you have listened for a while

1101
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,920
and you've never really thought about it,

1102
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,560
just give it a ponder, ponder if you can help support us.

1103
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,400
Because that is like, we get some scratch from the,

1104
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,960
you know, Jumbotrons and the advertisements and stuff,

1105
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,600
but like a bulk of the support that we get

1106
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,440
is through the Max Fund Drive, which is incredible.

1107
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,240
So yeah, think about keeping us afloat.

1108
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,120
That'll all be next week.

1109
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,240
Thank you to-

1110
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,040
And the week after.

1111
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,960
It's a two week affair.

1112
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,240

Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,760
for the use of our theme song,

1135
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,160
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1136
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,240
Had a listener tweet at me and you

1137
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,840
and you saying that they finally caved and bought the album.

1138
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,120
Not sure what took them so long.

1139
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,600
It is fucking phenomenal.

1140
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,840
So go check that out and buy it where albums are sold.

1141
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,640
That's gonna do it for us.

1142
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,720
My brother and me, we got one more question

1143
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,120
from Ditto Griffin.

1144
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,600
Hit us.

1145
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:35,840
Sure.

1146
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,760
This one was sent in by Emerald member Drew Davenport.

Thank you, Drew.

1148
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Selena,

00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:46,080

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,480
Kiss your dad.

1154
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,440
Square on the lips.

1155
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,000

Super fun.
