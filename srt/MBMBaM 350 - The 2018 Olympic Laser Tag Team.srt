1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,320
Uh, wow folks, uh, big exciting news from Holly Weird, um, big thinker, big Hollywood thinker,

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,400
uh, much like the James Cameron of our generation. Travis P. McElroy is here

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
to speak with us. Uh, he told us that he had a new movie idea that he wanted to run past us.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
It's been a while. Love hearing these big movie ideas because I always know what blockbusters to

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,480
look forward to in the following fiscal year. Now listen, here's the thing I want to let you

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,320
all know. Up front, this is going to take a lot of capital to get made. This is not going to-

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
Oh shit.

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
It's going to be more expensive than Avatar, but I think when you hear it-

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
How much did, how much was an avat- how much did,

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
if I wanted to do an Avatar, how much would that run me?

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
I think it was a hundred thousand dollars Canadian.

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
Damn.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,520
I'm not sure, but I think that's like a hundred billion American. I'm not sure what the,

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,080
what the exchange rate is, but listen to this. It popped in my head this morning

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,320
and it, it was like I woke up with a start and I thought, why hasn't there been

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
a Fast and the Furious Transformers crossover movie?

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
Oh my God, Travis, this is a bad idea.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
Travis, you doofus, that's a great idea.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,120
Thank you, Justin. Thank you for getting on board with an amazing movie. How is that a terrible

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
idea, Griffin? What do people love? They love giant robots that turn into cars. What do they

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,360
love? They love the Fast and the Furious family gang that drives cars real fast. What's that you

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
say? The robots turn into cars and then the Fast and the Furious people can drive those

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,320
robots real fast? Fuck yes.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
Are you telling me you don't want to see Vin Diesel in a fucking exoskeleton

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
that transformed out of a Harley into an exoskeleton for him to fight

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
bad Optimus Prime? Are you kidding me?

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,880
First of all, uh, uh, Vin- Toretto, Vinnie Toret- no, what's his fucking name?

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,760
Dominic Toretto.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,600
Dominic- Dominic Toretto would never ride a motorcycle. He looks at one of those and he says,

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,160
well, that's half a car. And so he doesn't, he doesn't do it. And I think it's because he's

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,200
actually afraid of motorcycles, but he's like way too proud about it. But the other thing is if

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,720
you're in the cockpit of a car, when it transforms into a transformer, you'll be liquefied. And I

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,640
don't want to watch all my fucking good friends get liquefied like Tokyo Drift Boy and Dominic

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,520
Toretto.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,520
That is a myth. You actually enter their brain like in Pacific Rim and suddenly you're piloting

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,920
that Jaeger, son. You're, you are like synced. It's you and Optimus Prime doing battle against

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,720
whoever the bad guy would be. Uh, I don't know. Maybe, uh, who I, who's Clive Owen. Maybe Clive

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
Owen's the bad guy in this one. You know, and he's, he and Optimus, not Optimus Prime. Who's

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
the bad one? Who's the bad one?

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Uh, bad Optimus-

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,880
Megatron.

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,360
Yeah.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,000
Megatron.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Megatron.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Megatron.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
Megaduck. He's fighting Megaduck and-

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,520
Here's the other issue is that Vin Diesel refuses to be in any movie where there is an object

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,080
larger than him in it. So like from a sense of scale perspective, it's going to be tough

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,960
to get these big robots fighting around while Vin Diesel is also on the screen.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,720
You'll have to make Vin Diesel bigger then.

59
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,960
I guess so, but then that's anticlimactic because then he can just knock the other bad

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,760
robots over.

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:20,000
Let me hit you with this. Transformers meets Fast and the Furious meets the Before Sun

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
Rise franchise.

63
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, okay, well hold on.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,720
What I'm seeing here is you would have Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke just sort of having

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,760
coffee and intense conversations as like just a cutaway, basically. Just like a cut to a

66
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,160
building's being destroyed, panned down. I can't believe they're still going at it. Yeah,

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,520
me neither. Anyway, Sunrise is just a few hours away.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
We better hurry.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
Okay, wait, Justin.

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,880
Also, if the Autobots don't stop the Decepticons before Sunrise, Earth will end. So it's like

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,920
very much like that's how you... They're sort of like our time keepers for the film.

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,200
Baby, you are going to miss that plane. And then Domic Toretto's like,

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,800
not on my watch. And he grabs Ethan Hawke and he gets into the airport and he doesn't

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
miss the plane. And then the robot punches the airplane out of the sky.

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Fuck, this is really good actually now that I think about it.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,160
Justin, you've inspired me. How about this? All right.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay.

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,120
Fast and the Furious meets Transformers meets Boyhood. You filmed the movie over 20 years.

79
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
You get to watch the robots get bigger.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,780
Yes.

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I think I like the before Sunrise one better.

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay. What if we do all of them together?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Okay, so Boyhood is in the before Sunrise movies. And it's like before Sunrise and

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,040
then after Sunrise and then like for 12 more years after all of the Sunrises,

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,200
many, many Sunrises. And boy, this boy is just getting bigger and he's getting surlier, isn't he?

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,560
Yeah, this is actually great. So take that and sell it. Just give us some,

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,200
I guess. Give us some of it. That sound about right? I'm not sure the technical...

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
You'll know in your heart what the right amount is.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,480
But for right now, let's really get into the advice. Let's get deep in and help people.

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,800
We just had a huge turnout in the Max Fun Drive and everybody really came out for us.

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
So now I think it's time for us to come out for them.

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I recently found out that my boyfriend who I've been living with for over a year has been hiding

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,600
precious metals, silver, gold around the house. He acted very strange when I asked him about it.

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
His reason being that they are investments and to not go looking for them.

96
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
Should I be concerned?

97
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,200
Am I dating a Ron Swanson or a treasure hoarding dragon? That's from fool's gold in Oklahoma City.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,760
So this is a unique...

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,360
You found it, eh? I knew this day would come. Well, here's the secret.

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,760
If you go hunting for my gold, I come hunting for you.

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
This is definitely a Desolation of Greg situation.

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,480
The only reason you do this is for a doomsday prepper, right?

103
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:28,560
There is a school of thought that not just doomsday prepper, but if the economy tanks,

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,200
gold will still be doing okay. It's a safe investment, some people think.

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't think they think it's safe to hide it around your house like a wears wall though.

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
But I don't know exactly.

107
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,760
I will say that as a kid who grew up reading a lot of like magical realism, you know,

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:55,280
Indian in the cupboard, kind of like a bridge should tear biffy, your lions, your witches,

109
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,080
and or wardrobes that like the idea I think about this now is like what if I like hid like,

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,320
you know, hid gold coins somewhere like in a banister or something.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,120
And then when BB finds them in 10 years, she's like, what?

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
And I'm like, huh? How'd that get there?

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,200
And now it's like a magical mystery in our house.

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Maybe we have leprechauns in the house. I don't know.

115
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
It's magical for her.

116
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Yeah, I don't know.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Maybe maybe your boyfriend's doing that for you.

118
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
He wants to have a little mystery in your relationship.

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
You know what I mean?

120
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
He's definitely not doing that.

121
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
I want to get in front of Travis's bad point and say he's definitely not doing this to add

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
mystery to your relationship.

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,280
It is it is because one Oh, isn't he? Isn't he Griffin? Because it sounds like there's some

124
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,240
mystery. Sounds like this question asker is left with some questions.

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Yeah, I mean, no, I think this was not intentional.

126
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,160
I think it's a nice side effect. Don't get me wrong.

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm curious about this relationship.

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,880
And also, in Oklahoma City, like you've just given me a map that I can use to triangulate

129
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,520
and come come calling come fucking come come on a fucking Diablo run of your of your of

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,080
your house and get those get all that sweet coins.

131
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Get all those gold bars.

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm not saying I would.

133
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
Yeah, Griffin, you're right.

134
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,920
This is like in Zelda when you walk out and you smash a jar and you're like,

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
who hides their jewels in just like a jar in their barn?

136
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
This person does.

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,840
Greg does.

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Greg hides them there.

139
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Greg hides them there.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
That makes me think everybody in Zelda is just like prepping.

141
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
Just like the Hylian economy is going to collapse.

142
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Our fucking king is a boat.

143
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,000
I just like sell your gold to me.

144
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm on your radio, your fantasy radio.

145
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Why would what why would you why would you do this?

146
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,840
I guess is the question I keep coming back to is why would you hide all your gold and

147
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,320
silvers?

148
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
I feel like just I do.

149
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,640
I think it breaks down a little bit when you're like, I am going to be very safe and buy a

150
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
bunch of gold and silver.

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,480
I, however, am just going to kind of scatter them about the house like so many lost chapsticks

152
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
and just hope that I can remember where all that all of them are if needed.

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,160
I guess so.

154
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,240
I think about this like it would be good for me to have like some bottles of water on hand.

155
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
That's about as far as like my prep instincts go.

156
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
And by which I mean, I still don't have the water.

157
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
But I think like that might be nice to have on hand.

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
You get some water at some point.

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,600
Am I so far behind the curve?

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,440
Is it good to have a much gold and many silver in your house?

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
I guess the question and I'm trying to come around to this.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Let me tell you.

163
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
Let me tell you as somebody who for a long time hosted a proper podcast.

164
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,480
No.

165
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,360
OK.

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,400
Because here's the thing in the immediate in the immediate like right after.

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Sure.

168
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,080
But like if we're talking a long term apocalypse, gold and silver are going to devalue very,

169
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,800
very quickly.

170
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Whereas like freeze dried food, yet rice is going to be worth its weight in gold.

171
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,400
Like actually, I went I went around my boyfriend's house and there were many

172
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,640
carrot seeds and potato seeds all over.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
I was very curious and excited about this.

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,960
I mean, is my boyfriend a very bad farmer who doesn't understand how seeds do?

175
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,040
It's better that than like a katana that he says he's going to get very good at at some point.

176
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Like this is my investment is I'm going to get good at katana.

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,720
So people want to have me on their crew, I guess.

178
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
I also will say I just had this thought the other day.

179
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm 33 and by many definitions an adult.

180
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't know how investments work.

181
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
For all I know, this might be the safest form of investment.

182
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,080
Oh, shit.

183
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah, it's possible.

184
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,320
It's very possible.

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
Welcome to bad money.

186
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,240
It's a new talk show that the three of us do and we don't know fucking anything.

187
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,480
So maybe get many gold and lots of silver, but make sure you got a katana because you

188
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
don't want one of those without the other because folks will know this house has much

189
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
gold in it, but no katanas.

190
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,120
Let's get them.

191
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,240
Right.

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
How about this yahoo?

193
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Can I give it to you?

194
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,080
Hit me.

195
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,960
Yahoo's got a yahoo's got another a new name again.

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
You remember our good old taba jokes?

197
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,640
Yeah, oath.

198
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,680
It's called oath now.

199
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
So it's a new it's a neat cult they're doing with Verizon.

200
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Yahoo decided let's get hey Verizon you up.

201
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,600
It's me yahoo.

202
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,520
Want to make a call with me?

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,440
You can't quit, right?

204
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,640
If you go in and you're like I'd like to resign.

205
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,680
I got a better opportunity and they're like my boy Tim Armstrong's like you're you're

206
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
a revoking your oath.

207
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,880
You're you're denying your oath and then he just opens the door.

208
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
Oathbreaker!

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
We have an oathbreaker!

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,800
Everybody looks up from their like grindstones.

211
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,480
No!

212
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh this is an AOL.

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,920
You forged the oath.

214
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
AOL's doing this too, huh?

215
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,400
Leave your ID card on the wedding stone.

216
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Just lay down on the onyx table and we'll get your severance package all sorted out.

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,600
Leave your scabbard with Valerie.

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,880
Um this oath was sent in by Drew Campbell.

219
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,440
Thank you oathbreaker Drew Campbell.

220
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,640
It's yahoo answers user.

221
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,800
It's oath use oath oath taker.

222
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Earl the snort oaths.

223
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
Who's on your laser tag team?

224
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,840
Um that's it.

225
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,520
There's no additional details.

226
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
Are there any answers from folks?

227
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,240
Uh oh the sickest says with the best answer five stars you.

228
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
Which is fucking pretty solid right?

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,880
Like if you're getting on oath to ask a oath about like who's on your laser tag team it

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,760
makes me assume you are an enthusiast and therefore probably have some fucking skills

231
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
out there on the cyber grid.

232
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
Hey guys who's on your laser tag team?

233
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm tempted to give a lazy answer which is just like folks I'd like to meet.

234
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
So like Barack Hussein Obama a lot of people forget that Hussein was important.

235
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,040
Um would be a big one like just because it would be like an honor you know Joe Biden

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,080
would be it would be an honor um but would they be the best at laser tag?

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,520
Joe Biden would yes absolutely no question Joe Biden yeah he would be like listen I've

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,680
always wanted to learn how to back flip and this is the moment I'm gonna do it right now.

239
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,200
And then he does and then he does he just does it over a team.

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,680
How many are we talking let's put a limit on this.

241
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,160
I think five I think including you it's five so you'd have four additional members of let's

242
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,640
all work together let's not do individual laser tag teams and we wouldn't we maybe we get five

243
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,640
not including us because I don't I did it once I played laser tag once at a place here in Austin

244
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,040
called Blazertag and um they make you get really really high before no um and they just put you

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,400
in a sensible tweed coat and I was like siphon filtering all over the fucking place just like

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,520
no scoping kids and then as I left the place I realized that I was in like a mild state of

247
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,280
cardiac arrest because of all the running and diving and shooting I'd been doing and

248
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,440
so I don't think I'm cut out for it. I hate it when kids don't get into it

249
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,080
sometimes you're laser tagging with kids and they're like just run up to you and shoot you

250
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,960
it's like where's the action where's the imagination I think that bothers me a lot.

251
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Uh assuming we're going to be playing against teens I would like to welcome to my team uh

252
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,080
Ariana Grande and whoever's big on YouTube right now I don't actually know whoever's

253
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,960
big on YouTube right now who's not also a secret mega racist yeah yeah whoever's whoever could do

254
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,600
that for us. Ariana Grande is not secretly uber racist right she just licked that donut that one

255
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,280
time I mean I think that's if she was secret we wouldn't know until it's too late until she's like

256
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,960
you're you're playing laser tag and she's like take this is for my superior race

257
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,360
Ariana no no no get it you're off the team you're at a party and you're like bang bang into the

258
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,440
and somebody's like no no no no no no no no no no no we don't we don't do that anymore we don't

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,200
bang bang into the room anymore um that would be a sick song to laser tag to though that would be

260
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:18,320
great let me pitch this name Keanu Reeves yes yes yes yes yes Travis wins the contest that

261
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,400
fucking dude if you've seen like his um like videos of him like training and like running

262
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,560
those gun obstacle courses training for John Wick it's like the dude's got it he's a fucking got it

263
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,000
I absolutely must have him on the team except wait I'm gonna wait hold on I'm going to contradict

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,640
myself because now I'm worried he's gonna make everybody else on the team look really bad like

265
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,760
it'll be like wow we had you know 20 confirmed hits yeah 18 of them were John Wick's like between

266
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,560
the other four of us we hit two people because everyone we came across was already zapped out

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:02,320
yeah another problem is that he also um executes a lot of what Solid Snake calls uh CQC and so I

268
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,520
think that if you strike if you strike someone in the laser tag field of battle you are asked to

269
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,800
leave the Billy Bob's Wonderland yeah so that may be an issue but it's too good to back out from

270
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,960
because I know I I saw that video and I thought Keanu Reeves may very well be the coolest living

271
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,120
human right now uh which I I yeah I don't think you can dull those instincts his instinct is to

272
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,640
shoot someone in the head and then spin around and punch someone in the face with the gun and

273
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,840
I think we train that out he'd shoot somebody in the head and he'd turn around he'd be like no not

274
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:44,160
I can't do this anymore I can't not anymore that's three number four person to do it Sarah

275
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,480
Michelle Geller okay Michelle Geller is a it's an interesting choice that's a very good choice

276
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,640
I'll tell you why because she's got a lot of experience navigating tv that's one thing you

277
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
know she's had she's had a great career it's got a lot of different interesting places that's huge

278
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,720
I want to detract yeah intimidation factor I think is also through the roof if I fuck him

279
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,800
is in the laser tag arena and I saw Sarah Michelle Geller coming at me with one of those cool cyber

280
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,280
guns I would say bye and I would leave I would leave I would leave after paying my money for

281
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
my ticket into laser tag I would actually leave the place without having finished the match

282
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,800
so scared would I be so scared would I be we've been watching a lot of Buffy

year old to kill his dog in front of him the 12 year old would shoot would buffet his dog with

harmless lasers I would love to watch Keanu react to that no I see he's fine Keanu he's fine this

320
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,160
is the light gun the dog would be wearing a very small laser tag vest and so it would like burst

321
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:33,280
and he would have to leave the room and go have some pizza Idris Elba Ariana Grande Keanu Reeves

329
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,520
and pew pew pew I'm Idris Elba I got you um uh here's another question I recently ordered a

330
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,960
couple pairs of jeans direct from Levi's and they arrived today that's it that's the entire

331
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:33,040
question it's I don't know good I'm glad um no there's more I here it is the jeans were exactly

332
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,480
what I ordered that's actually the end uh so just a positive experience this person oh no oh no

333
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,920
that's right this is just a Levi's Yelp review yeah uh but there was also a brand new complete

334
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:54,000
DVD box set of all six seasons of down navi all right nice um this is not unwelcome because I love

335
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,840
the show but I didn't order it and also you can't order DVDs from levi.com am I good that's from

336
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:12,720
nonplus in Nevada um a little you actually didn't realize that this is part of a new exciting cross

337
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,840
promotional uh sort of ad uh uh the campaign that's going on right now where they are doing

338
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,720
a seventh season of Downton Abbey and all the characters are wearing just the most well-fitting

339
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,400
just luscious blue jeans you've ever seen on any tv show it's a bit anachronistic and it kind of

340
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,960
goes against the whole like tone of the show but it's like Wellesley help me dress and then an

341
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,720
older man helps a still pretty old man put on some very nice jeans I'll tell you guys exactly

342
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:54,480
what happened here some bumbling uh you know just uh clumsy Levi's warehouse worker has shown up to

343
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,280
their aunt's birthday party empty-handed they stopped by the sun coast on their way to work

344
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:09,280
to pick up a birthday present for their aunt and now they're left box set less I see so they were

345
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,560
and they had to make a stop by the the the blue jeans factory still carrying their box set with

346
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,600
them and they were standing over the denim vat and they were oh no and they dropped the box set

347
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,800
into the denim vat which then printed out the blue jeans and the dvds were just made it in the box

348
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:37,840
exactly I just I mean I'm assuming that this happened in like a fulfillment center right

349
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,080
this has happened in a place that fulfills Levi's orders and Downton Abbey orders but I do have a

350
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,040
problem with like you look in a box there's jeans in the box is this one for the okay yeah just go

351
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,920
ahead and maybe I don't know I'm very busy we have a lot of we've got a lot of jeans to get rid of

352
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:04,080
today I do also want to point out origin story I know you're wondering yes John Cougar Mellencamp

353
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,520
did fall the Joker style into the denim vat and that is that is his cruel origin if he had fallen

354
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,760
into the box set DVD of Downton Abbey vat right next to it he would have had a completely different

355
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,240
yeah completely different arc a proper bloke I'm it's me John Cougar Mellencamp a proper bloke

356
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,960
like on Downton Abbey does this little ditty about Lord Grantham and Lady Grantham that's him

357
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,600
it rhymes uh did uh does this person owe a call to levies.com yes you stole their dvds definitely

358
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,560
you should call them I mean you should have won this might be the golden ticket like you won

359
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,520
you get to you get to go on a tour of the denim factory with a uh idiosyncratic

360
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:59,520
leader of the company who's going to well here's the thing gonna kill four kids and that's just

361
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,280
that's non-negotiable Billy Tonka but they're gonna be it's Billy Tonka the leader of Levi's

362
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,320
I know you would think Levi would be in his name somewhere but no no anyway four kids will suffer

363
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,800
a horrible fate but you'll learn a lot about morality or whatever and all the jeans you can eat

364
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,320
I feel like you have to call if only because Levi's owes you an explanation

365
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,960
for how this could happen like you are on the edge of like a a serial style mystery here that

366
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,480
you could unravel and then get back to us and just like call Levi's don't let them off the hook

367
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,160
until you understand how Downton Abbey all six seasons in a complete DVD box set

368
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,880
arrived it with your jeans you deserve an answer that can't be cheap right we're talking at least

369
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,800
a hundred dollar box set on the deals yeah you know that's nobody's buying DVDs anymore

370
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,440
I think those DVDs are subsidized by the by the MacArthur Foundation or something like that so

371
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,760
I think they're not actually that expensive pretty assuming who's been trying to scale back

372
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,160
their material uh possessions and clutter I would actually be pretty bummed about somebody

373
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,560
sending me a huge DVD box set at this point like I really I do not have a shelf space

374
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,520
you know what I mean yeah exactly I'm asking if you get call them back and ask if you can

375
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,760
trade it in for that I got the Downton love it uh don't want to be ungrateful but I would like a

376
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:32,160
gift card in place of this item I'm now thinking of in the Levi's blue jeans factory what the

377
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,840
equivalent room of the room where Willy Wonka sang pure imagination would be like we're just

378
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,600
everything is made out of blue jeans and denim everything is wearable you can wear any to see

379
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:52,480
that flower put it on um how about a yahoo yeah sure this one was sent in by brooks oglesby thank

380
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,800
you brooks it's yahoo answers user oath user sorry something's gone wrong uh this would this

381
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,040
is good this would be a good um like parlance we can just say when something has gone wrong

382
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,720
they are an oath breaker who has left the service before their watch has ended um this oath breaker

383
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,720
asks could I play video games for the school talent show I just answered a question on here

384
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:23,200
that reminded me to ask this I have I have hardly any talents but I'm a video game expert when I

385
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,240
start a game I always begin on expert and usually end it my school has this huge tv thing I think

386
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,640
um could I simply hook up my xbox 360 and play on the big screen thing so everyone sees as my

387
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,400
talent like it's a first-person shooter or something do you think they'll let me it is like

388
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:45,040
one of my only talents that I can possibly do all right um the the short answer is I would lose my

389
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,440
fucking mind if I was still in high school and somebody was like what's up my name is Derek

390
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,600
here's some monoscopes and then he gets up there and does his thing that would be I would watch

391
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,440
I would watch that and be absolutely thrilled just no pressure or anything but if you tell people

392
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,480
like I this is worth watching you can watch this I feel like it it's a bit you're you cannot fuck

393
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,320
up at all this game's called Call of Duty this game's called Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 I'm

394
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,640
gonna play around search and destroy all right nerd and then like fucking 30 seconds in you're

395
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,080
like oh my god he's doing it it's really doing it here's the thing like I was all prepared to

396
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,960
make jokes about this and then I remember like there are people who are like super famous for

397
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,080
doing this oh yeah sure sure sure but um maybe not among their high school peers I don't know

398
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,040
nowadays what did you guys ever participate in a high school talent show please tell me now if you

399
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:53,040
did high school no no not that uh elementary school for sure I I just starred in all the

400
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,240
school plays I didn't need to do a town I I co-hosted my high school talent show this is not

401
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,240
a bit um either my junior or senior year with a gentleman named Richard and Richard was the school

402
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,960
magician um but wait hold on he was designated as such he was the kid who like I know my thing

403
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,640
it's gonna be magic and so he would always be doing like little card tricks at the lunch in

404
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,840
the lunch room and so me and Richard hosted the talent show one year and fucking people were

405
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:37,760
eating out of our hands up on that stage um and I this is horrible a uh a young woman got up there

406
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,120
to play a piano song uh that was really lovely um and I think she ended up coming in like second

407
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,800
place for the competition um and I want to just hit this very hard the people very much enjoyed

408
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,840
her set but as we intro'd her our thing was like wouldn't it be funny if we got up there and did

409
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,560
a magic trick so we went up there and he did this very long-winded magic trick because behind the

410
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,320
curtain they had to set up like her piano and they had to clear off the last the last thing

411
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,800
and the magic trick was very long-winded and had very many steps of me picking a card and then

412
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,680
going out and showing a few people in the audience the card you know really fucking work and I'm

413
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,760
getting a mean at my hand and then we got up there and said all right time for the magic

414
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,080
tree to end and he just threw all the cards up in the air and that was it and we like walked off

415
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,360
the stage it's like a joke like haha fuck you guys very like um you know transgressive comedy

416
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:33,280
and the audience was booing very loud as the curtain opened oh for this for this young woman

417
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,600
to play her music song and she I'll say this it was a hostile room we created a hostile environment

418
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,920
she won them back and it was a story of redemption but oh my god did I feel absolutely awful because

419
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,760
I like as soon as we did it I walked on the stage like oh that was a bad idea we created a not good

420
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,680
workspace here I think Richard Griffin I actually thought that was going to go a different direction

421
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,240
I thought you were going to say that the magic trick was Richard made her piano disappear leaving

422
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,120
her completely unable to perform her song now you tell me how that trick would have gone down

423
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,200
I probably would have gone down really well if he had been able to pull it off

424
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,840
I guess that's true I would I want to watch this kid play video games now

425
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,680
I do want to see him play video games there is a very there's a very thin like there's a tight

426
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,960
rope that he could pull this off and if he did but isn't this true think about it anybody who gets

427
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
up if they're like my talent I'm gonna shred on the electric guitar like you have to be good you

428
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,760
can't just like get up and kind of like pick out some like chords or if you got up and you're like

429
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,880
I I'm gonna play piano and you only know like heart and soul like no you if you get up there

430
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,760
you're inherently saying I am very confident in my ability to do this in an entertaining way

431
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,560
so like I don't know if this kid's confident enough to get up there and play some video games

432
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,120
yeah I'd like to see that and it it also depends on the game because I don't know that I would be

433
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,040
so psyched to just like watch somebody do very well while playing call of duty but if you heard

434
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,440
like all right here comes Jeff and he's gonna play some video games and you're like whatever

435
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,400
and then the curtains parted and there were four DDR machines standing side by side by side and

436
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,920
he was like what's up my name is Jeff I'm gonna do paranoia survivor max on four machines at once

437
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,080
here I go and he like does the damn thing I might lose my fucking mind yeah that will be I think the

438
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,800
musical element is huge I because I worry that the perform like even if it's sick the performance

439
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,200
aspect of it is not going to be great like you're not gonna people aren't going to know what's cool

440
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,920
unless every few minutes you look back at them like right dig it that kind of thing yeah oh

441
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,400
that's what you do you you turn the tv so the audience can't see it and you just look at them

442
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:55,360
and just occasionally say I'm doing a great job this is just keep giving score updates from time

go to church like that and you leave different change how metamorphosized how do you fellows

482
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:21,680
think us breaking down the lyrics of pony got two humans yeah i don't want to i don't want to be

483
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,160
ribald here but i mean they're very erotically charged lyrics and we read them in a way that

484
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,680
was maybe sensual to some folks yeah i'm not gonna yuck any yums but if that if you found that

485
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,960
sensual that's fine do you think it seems like these two did two people listening independently

486
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,720
on different ends of a bar to us discuss very rib both kind of like made eye contact at the same

487
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,320
time and just mouthed pony question mark and they just nodded and from that point forward

488
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,680
they were inseparable i think that's the most likely situation yeah i feel like that this this

489
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,680
if i had to guess and i'm completely completely guessing but i feel like that this probably

490
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,120
started out as a joke and then at some point one of the two parties started saying the lyrics a

491
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,240
lot more sincerely until at one point someone looked directly in the other person's eyes and

492
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:22,480
said hey no but seriously if you're horny yeah let's do it write it my pony

493
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,600
my saddle's waiting juices flowing down your thigh okay this next message that's a lyric

494
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,640

495
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:45,680

500
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,000

now at max funcon.com the weather's starting to be nice around here which means doing stuff outdoors

539
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,480
there's one part of my outdoor repertoire that's sadly missing i never learned how to ride a bike

540
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:41,440
okay i'm 30 uh uh as a 33 year old how do i do that i mean the obvious answer is just to hop

541
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,640
up and do it but it's not like they sell adult bikes with trading wheels and that's from pining

542
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,880
to pedal in pittsburgh oh my this is a really it's a really good question it's a good question um

543
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,680
i bought a bike last year um because i live in austin like everybody bikes and so i was like i

544
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,880
could hey i can do this i need to close mark lucas's official website by the way he's got a

545
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,320
store never mind does he have any music auto playing he does he's got a music section anyway

546
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,360
um and so i went i like bought a bike and i went to the bike shop and found a bike i really like

547
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,920
i was like hell yeah he's like do you want to try it out i was like yeah sure and i went in

548
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,480
the parking lot and got on and i was like hey wait a minute it's been like fucking 15 years

549
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,960
since i've done this i'm gonna fall over and a bus is gonna hit me and it's gonna be really

550
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,280
embarrassing and deadly um and so like i'm i'm right there with you because i don't know there's

551
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,840
a way to get out of this with hold on griffin i do want to know the rest of that um when you

552
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,120
tried it out in the parking lot and realized you were going to die did you then turn to the sales

553
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:55,040
person and say oh one second thought no i was like i'll take it i'll ride it around in small

554
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:03,040
concentric circles in my empty garage um no i uh i i just did it and it was very fucking wobbly

555
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,480
and i looked like i looked like i mean i looked like a fucking toddler learning to ride a bike

556
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,160
again because it literally had been half my life since i'd been on a bike bike cycle um there are

557
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,640
a couple of big problems with this the first off is a big part of learning to ride a bike is falling

558
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:27,360
and when you're young you can just fall like you just fall and it's fine and when you're 33 years

559
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:34,880
old and fall it's not fine it's i mean well it's hysterical for starters but it's also very dangerous

560
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,960
because you're gonna be there you have a lot longer to go and your bones are older so it's not

561
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,720
a good idea to just fall repeatedly the other problem is if a kid is riding their bike on the

562
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,400
sidewalk that's adorable if an adult is riding their bike on the sidewalk is it it's a crime

563
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,480
yeah especially riding poorly yeah yeah that's where i bailed actually on bike riding is i got

564
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,000
to an age where people were like go ride in the street and that i had a look at like where the

565
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,520
cars are do you know how fast they go do you want me to go as fast as a car you gave him that you

566
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,720
gave him that dominic toretto but it's only two wheels it's only two wheels doesn't make sense

567
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,880
can't do it here's the thing here's the thing question asker and maybe this will be a little

568
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,920
controversial but i think that the reason kids learn to ride bikes is because at the time it is

569
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,880
the only vehicle it is the best vehicle option open to them as an adult you can drive a car with

570
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,760
the windows down no bikes are great bikes are good and they're good for the environment they're good

571
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,320
for you and they're fun to ride around on yes but my point being if you haven't learned how to ride

572
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,560
one up to this point like it's not too late no you can go your whole life you can go i'm not saying

573
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,760
it's too late i'm saying you could go your whole life saint peter is not going to meet you at the

574
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,320
pearly gates like so never learned how to ride a bike come go to hell like it just isn't going to

575
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,120
happen that's defeatist i'm just saying it's going to be harder than if you had learned as a child

576
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,680
that's all i'm saying so how would you how here's how you learn here's how you learn to ride a bike

577
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,080
when you're a little kid and there's this moment you have riding a bike is so weird because it's

578
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,520
one of the very few things in life we're just like once you do it right the first time you do it right

579
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,920
every time after that it's like once you realize like oh if i just go is fine um if i just like

580
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,720
keep pedaling and moving forward like it'll it'll hold me up and it'll be good um and so this is me

581
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,840
griffin mcelroy giving you a 100 guarantee if you get on that bike and you just start pedaling

582
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,080
really fast you'll be you'll be okay you're not the top of a high hill commit yourself to it no

583
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,920
don't don't peanuts this person no um you're 33 years old you've got a lot more control over your

584
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,120
body at this point that's the one thing is your limbs and stuff you are super good you know how

585
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,160
to work those things don't be afraid to do it i'm gonna go back to what i decided to stay and buy it

586
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,920
with the car thing because when you're a little kid and you fall over on your bike it's frustrating

587
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,960
but you have no other option left available to you i'm saying i am 33 if i had never learned how to

588
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,360
ride a bike the first time i fell over like well fuck this i'm gonna get in the thing with four

589
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:23,920
wheels now and doors um can you take an act i stand by my point your bad point i stand by it

590
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:33,200

618
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,680

619
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,440
buffett and the other one references austin powers like which one are you which well do

620
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,800
you guys alternate word for word no i'll read them both one's sending one is from oathbreaker

621
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,520
kyle fleming thank you kyle it's from oathbreaker sloughlin0931 who asks is jack sparrow a better

622
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,360
island icon than jimmy buffett the other one was sent by level 9000 oathbreaker drew davenport by

623
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:01,280
oathbreaker fur k who says where can i find austin powers type decorating ideas for a yacht

624
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,880
tie it all together i vote the first one i think that's just because you want to talk a lot about

625
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,400
jimmy buffett as always i'll work austin powers in there all right yeah we'll come around to

626
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,280
austin powers we'll answer both of one thing so let me say this first off because it's not been

627
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,520
made abundantly clear my wife is the one who turned me on to jimmy but don't this don't now listen

628
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,520
tweet at my wife and tell her you know that everyone everyone tweeted sydney and tell her

629
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,640
that she liked jimmy buffett first so she will get off my back about it okay that's the first

630
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,120
thing wait wait wait tweet it tweet at my wife so there's austin there's the austin powers joke

631
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:49,680
well that's borat uh moving on the best island icon is james buffett and you asked me why well

632
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:57,600
i have a good answer for you jb when he's on an island he's not trying to get back off that island

633
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:06,000
as soon as humanly possible and that does seem to be the mo of mr jack sparrow jb learned how to

634
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,720
fly a plane so if he wasn't at an island he would he had one within reach theoretically speaking at

635
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,640
all times able to get back to an island when necessary let me ask you a question justin two

636
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:27,120
questions question one what are mr buffett's feelings on rum and it being gone uh okay what's

637
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,120
your second question the second question is is he at all related to sailors has he ever done it

638
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:40,000
all related to sailors has he ever done any sailing well uh okay here's the answer to your

639
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,400
first question is there is a margaritaville rum so i bet he feels sad about it yeah he would not

640
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:52,960
he would not feel good about that because he made rum himself margaritaville rum.com just go catch

641
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:00,000
the spirit by which i mean rum uh so jb made a dark rum and what was your second question uh is

642
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,280
he related to sailors in any way does he know how to sail does jimmy buffett what are you what are

643
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,040
you talking about because here's the thing jack sparrow listen he's kind of bumbly but he always

644
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,640
seems to know what he's doing but when it comes to boatsmanship oh my god jack sparrow he is he's a

645
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:28,640
deft hand at the wheel would you say he's the son of a son of a sailor he probably is travis patrick

646
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:36,000
mackleroy i know he's at least the son of one sailor one one generation i have to start reading

647
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,600
these answers because there's a hundred of them and each one is a beautiful diamond that god made

648
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,720
in heaven uh i'm just gonna read them without reading the names because again there are so many

649
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,640
that i need to get through duh captain jack sparrow he is way finer jack sparrow more people

650
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:03,120
know him uh yep jack sparrow is hot i love jack sparrow who's the other dude uh it's a near tie

651
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,600
but i would say that jack sparrow nearly beats out jimmy buffett if only jack would sing about rum

652
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:16,960
then he'd be a winner for sure he definitely did in most of the movies although i love jack sparrow

653
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,720
jimmy buffett is the original margaritaville king all right one one notch there for jimmy buffett and

654
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,840
then the best answer maybe of all time and if they shut oath down tomorrow please let this be

655
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:36,960
it's swan song david e one decade ago says it doesn't take 10 years ago it says one decade ago

656
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:45,600
says the seaplane ship sailing margarita and rum pot smoking book writing musician party animal and

657
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:53,600
leader of the parrot heads of course jack sparrow is a poser hell jack can't even get any p word

658
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:01,360
that refers to a vagina let alone he doesn't use dope which we seen in deadwood of the wild west

659
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,240
why wouldn't pirates use it oh it's a disney film jimmy is the party while jack is just for himself

660
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:17,440
who's the better icon okay i want to say that my favorite part about this is had this not been a

661
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:24,160
disney movie there would have been so many scenes of jack sparrow just getting fucking lit it is

662
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:32,320
already implied that basically anytime jack sparrow hoes out of frame he is smoking marijuana

663
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,960
if you do not see him at that moment in that scene in full frame he is smoking marijuana that

664
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:47,280
is even if you can see him but his back is to you he is holding a tasty rip oh man

665
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:57,600
jack sparrow is just for himself jimmy is jimmy is the party the only people make a lot of fan art

666
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:04,160
related to our family of products the only one i'm interested in anymore is pictures

667
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,360
just pictures of jimmy buffett and jack sparrow hanging out just shaking hands coming together

668
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,880
just living that island lifestyle i mean let's let's put it this way guys if you're going to

669
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,880
hang out on an island for an afternoon with one of these characters and i do say that i'm sure

670
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,840
james buffett in his private life isn't quite as island obsessed as jimmy buffett the performer

671
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,560
and songwriter and restaurateur which one would you rather hang out with because i think this

672
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,280
person's right that jimmy buffett would want to like you would roll up and jimmy would be like

673
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,800
hey good news the shrimp are about ready to come off the grill sit down let me get you a corona or

674
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,600
maybe a tequila from the margaritaville line um that would be more up your alley jack sparrow

675
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,080
would just be trying to steal your identity the entire time that's a good point that is fair you

676
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,720
never know where you stand with jack sparrow i guarantee like you trust jimmy buffett right away

677
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,520
because i doubt he has the energy to lie to you it's just like yep i yep i'm here for myself like

678
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,320
cool jimmy buffett thank you for being very upfront with me jimmy jimmy buffett is probably thrown

679
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:17,280
to 20 000 boat-based parties in his awesome amazing life and in none of them has anybody

680
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,680
ever been marooned and that's all i'm gonna say there is who would you want to stand side by side

681
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:31,520
with in a battle against like evil skeletal pirates uh jimmy jimmy buffett okay all right

682
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,720
buffett do you know why you got any others jimmy buffett has a lot of money and he lives nowadays

683
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:44,960
so he could probably buy like a big machine gun and just rip him the fuck up in a cloud of bullets

684
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:52,880
here's what i want here's what i want here's what i want i want fan art of james buffett and jack

685
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,920
sparrow standing together both in skeletal form they've taken some doubloons out of the the chest

686
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,560
and they're both holding the balloons they're both skeletons and they you can see the giant

687
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,840
clouds of weed in their chest cavities fuck yeah dude and maybe it's kind of seeping through their

688
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:16,640
ribs and they're both just like high-fiving and holding up coins some some mall kiosk t-shirt

off the album putting the days to bed and that the term departure was like some hip lingo for like
