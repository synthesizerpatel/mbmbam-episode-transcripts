1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Glamour McElroy. I'm your best brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,120
And the nominee for baby brother 30 under 30 media luminaries is Willem Dafoe.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh no, they read the wrong name.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,960
He's just a nominee, and Griffo McElroy. They only got two this year,

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
and I'm gonna beat his ass.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,120
Hey, do you guys remember when they read the wrong name last year?

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,600
Okay, okay, okay.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,440
Anything could happen in the Oscars.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,080
And I can't believe they're letting James Kimmel do it a second time

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,760
after he beefed it so hard on stage. Ripped a big beaver.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,960
Anyway, let's make jokes about Hollywood's biggest night.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Okay, sometimes I just call them the grouches.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
Well, that's fun. I was gonna do one where it's like,

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm having an Oscar party and you guys be like, oh, what are you doing?

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,120
And it's like, well, I'm inviting all my favorites. Oscar from The Office,

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Oscar the Grouch, Travis already fucking sort of trampled.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,760
Oscar de la Hoya.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
Oscar de la Hoya's got the invite.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,680
Oscar from Odd Couple? Isn't that an Oscar?

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,160
We gotta, we can do better than this. We can do better than this.

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm looking forward to seeing a big win for Sarasari Ranon from Lady Bird.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,120
So the joke there is that you said the name really very, very bad.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
We're starting the episode over.

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,880
No, no, no, no, we're not, we're not, we're in Justin's joke.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,640
This is not part of the episode that we release to people.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
No, we're pulling it back, we're pulling it back, we're pulling it back.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,080
Okay, okay.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
Now Justin-

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Mine was nothing.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,880
No, but we can punch it up because you could be like,

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
pronounce other names wrong.

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
And then the one who gave out the award was Matt Damon.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,040
It's like, do you mean Matt Damon?

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
And then the joke there is that you just can't say names correctly.

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
A lot of times, the problem is I isolated my joke too much

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
because it wasn't a joke, it was a half joke.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,040
Sometimes on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,960
if we do enough half jokes in sequence, it starts to feel funny.

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Like, not funny, ha ha, but like, boy, these boys are having a good time.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
I guess I should be having a good time too.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,800
Yes.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
It's kind of like guilting.

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
We're just throwing so much out there

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
that eventually you just kind of feel bad for not laughing.

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,080
So I have two jokes and I'd like to do them back to back.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
And the first one is this.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Yeah, you know, it's great that three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
is up for the big one, the big nomination,

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
but I think it's going to lose to four billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,960
And I thought it was kind of fucked up how they made that that movie.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
And they were like, well, we can we can do you one better.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,160
And then sure enough, it has it has one more billboard.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,080
It has Frances McDormand to the sequel to Frances McDormand.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
And it's better by just about one number, just about all across the board.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Hey, Griffin, that one actually got me.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,120
That one got you.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
OK, so that was very funny.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,160
Yeah, very funny.

64
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
Jamison, go ahead and put that one on the front.

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,680
Front load that one.

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
OK, here's my second joke.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah, I saw Shape of Water and I don't really get what the buzz is all about

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
because it's just Guillermo del Toro for an hour and a half,

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,240
just sort of barreling right down the camera.

70
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,160
And he's just like a puddle, a glass.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,040
If you pour it into a glass, it's that it looks like that.

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
You can do a bucket with it.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,840
If it gets real cold, you can make it sort of cube cube shaped.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
That's it.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
And he goes on and he thinks of way funnier stuff.

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
Fuck now, Jamison, put that one.

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,680
That was close.

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Jamison, when it's starting to peter out,

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,240
Jamison, just go ahead and drop that one right at the end.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,160
The absence of funny material in the first four and a half minutes of this program

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
is starting to make me feel a little panicky.

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
It feels like a weight on my chest.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Like it'll never come back.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Is it possible that the problem is not us?

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,440
It's just that the Oscars aren't fucking funny or interesting or anything?

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah, we did not really think about whether or not it should be an Oscars thing.

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
We just sort of threw that out.

88
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
First thought, best thought.

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,320
But sometimes with us, first thought, worst thought.

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,760
Which actually sounds better.

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,160
It does.

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
It actually rhymes.

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,200
It rhymes better than the other one.

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,360
When you get in that stage, Justin, you just gotta keep digging.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,480
You gotta keep digging your way out of the whale.

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
Just trust there's something in there.

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
Yeah, so just keep digging.

98
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
We're gonna hit it eventually.

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,800
What if we started our own-

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Listen, listen, listen.

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,400
Jamison's gonna make us sound cool and funny and smart.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
So don't you worry about that.

103
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay.

104
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
What if we just started our own Oscars?

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh.

106
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,440
And now here's the thing about our Oscars.

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
It's not about the movies that came out this year.

108
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680
It's about the movies we watched this year.

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,960
So like a movie from like the 70s could win best picture

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,160
because like we just saw it.

111
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,800
This is not-

112
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,800
This is nothing?

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Jamison, you know what to do with this one, right?

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
No, that had legs.

115
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,200
That could go somewhere.

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
What movies have you guys watched?

117
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,240
And that could be-

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah, Jamison, I trust you.

119
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,800
Jamison, I'm gonna give you a mark when to stop the cutting.

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
But what if it's really-

121
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
That could have had legs.

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
Jamison, wait for the mark.

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,960
Mark.

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,680
So are we starting over or what's our sort of vote currently?

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
What do you think, Jamison?

126
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,400
He's crying.

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,560
Jamison's crying.

128
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,640
You made Jamison cry, Justin.

129
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,120
Way to go.

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
You know he's going through a lot right now.

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
Jamison, you got any funny Oscar jokes?

132
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,640
I can't see that in the air.

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,800
The fuck's wrong with you, Jamison?

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
He needs to get on the mic.

135
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
He does need to get on the mic.

136
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Well, Jamison, can you put in the Audacity filter

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,880
and the audio editing that auto-tunes the jokes to be funnier?

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
It's auto-t-o-o-n-s.

139
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,120
Yeah.

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
Oh, and see, that was Jamison's work

141
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
because that was a pretty good joke.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
Travis didn't just say that.

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,320
I didn't say anything.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,920
I feel like I can't breathe.

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
What's wrong?

146
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,080
Justin, what's wrong?

147
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,920
It's like, will it ever be good again?

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,160
This is my career.

149
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
This is how I put food on the table for my family.

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Sure.

151
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,800
What we have is a really steep bell curve, Justin,

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,760
where the first four episodes were really bad

153
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,200
and then it started to improve.

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,840
And then here, at the end, as we round the corner to 400,

155
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
the last four episodes are going to be really bad.

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
It's getting dark in here.

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
It feels darker than it is right now.

158
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
I would swear it feels darker.

159
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
It's the same lighting I was at, but it feels darker in here.

160
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Well, the walls are closing in on Justin.

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Gotta raise these ceilings.

162
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm gonna lower my chair a bit

163
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,480
because the ceilings are getting really low.

164
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm just gonna lower my chair so I'm farther from them.

165
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
Justin, Justin, Justin.

166
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
My throat is closing up, so I'm not gonna respond, but I'm not.

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
I'll talk at you.

168
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,920
Go ahead and can you do a thing where you lower your chair

169
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,840
and then the chair falls over and you do a funny tumble out of it?

170
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah, let me try.

171
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,760
Hold on.

172
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
All right, I'm gonna try to lower.

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
That was the quietest fall I've ever heard.

174
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
My equipment is tuned.

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah, sure.

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
My equipment is tuned to only capture my voice.

177
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
Did you hear the fart though?

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
No, the fart came through.

179
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
The fart was something, right?

180
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,840
People are gonna chuckle at that.

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,200
I think we got it.

182
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
Holy shit.

183
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
It's a defense mechanism.

184
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,200
I want a mud squad.

185
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,160
I want to mud squad.

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,660
Wow.

187
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,760
Welcome to the reason you really tune in this podcast within a podcast.

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
Sometimes a podcast is an intro, I guess.

189
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
It's Munch Squad.

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,160
I want to encourage you to pull into Bojangles three weeks ago for heart-shaped

191
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Boberry Biscuits and More at Bojangles for V-Day, which meant something else

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,000
when we won the war, but now Bojangles has reclaimed V-Day for biscuits.

193
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,600
And they looked at the calendar and they saw V-Day coming up a few weeks back.

194
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Sorry, I've been on leave.

195
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,720
They saw V-Day coming up a few weeks back.

196
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,600
I didn't want to miss any of these.

197
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,280
And they said, we need something to celebrate Valentine's Day.

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,040
How about we give people five different things at Valentine's Day?

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
So Bojangles, this is a quote.

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
Bojangles is all about bringing people together for special moments,

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
says Bojangles, senior vice president of marketing, Randy Poindexter.

202
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
No, that's not a person.

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,200
That's a person on our program, not a character we created for our program,

204
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
Randy Poindexter.

205
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
And Bojangles is, whenever I go there to eat the sloppy chicken, I think,

206
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
I wish there were people closer to me for this special moment

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,880
of enjoying the spicy chicken to selects.

208
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,680
The quote continues, it's always challenging to come up with creative Valentine's Day gifts

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,680
and activities, but you can never go wrong by adding our signature Bojangles flavor

210
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
to your special day.

211
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Now, I can think of many ways in which adding Bojangles to your Valentine's Day

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
could go extremely wrong.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
Deeply wrong.

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
Deeply wrong.

215
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,960
What if your lover is allergic to chicken?

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,160
That's one thing.

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,400
Your lover doesn't enjoy spice or biscuits.

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,160
Yeah, your lover doesn't want to eat a wet mess.

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
I think it's great.

220
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,600
Randy talks about how hard it is, and then the very next graph, it says,

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
enjoy a heart-shaped Boberry biscuit.

222
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
So like, Randy says it's hard to come up with things, but really,

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
you just make it heart-shaped, huh?

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
That doesn't seem that hard, Rando.

225
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
Seems pretty easy.

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
So it's a famous buttermilk biscuit with Bo Berries.

227
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,720
Uncool to make.

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Okay, so berries have names when you look at them on the vine.

229
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Berries have names, right?

230
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
Blueberry, Blackberry, Raspberry.

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
This has got Bo Berries baked inside.

232
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,640
That's capitalized.

233
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,520
That's a proper noun.

234
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,160
What are you doing to the berries?

235
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
You take a raspberry and you water it exclusively with Bo Bice's sweat.

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,120
Yeah.

237
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Bo Bice is back.

238
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,800
Bojangles has partnered with Monsanto, and they have created a chicken-flavored berry.

239
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
I would fuck that up.

240
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,760
You can make your heart-shaped Bo Berry biscuit.

241
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,840
If you guys haven't seen it, it's literally a biscuit with blueberries baked,

242
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,280
sorry, Bo Berries baked into it with icing on top.

243
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,080
And then right after that, literally, it says, here's a scoop.

244
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Make your heart-shaped Bo Berry biscuit experience even sweeter

245
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,760
by adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream when you get home for a delectable dessert.

246
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
Now, what he said there is, when you get home,

247
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,280
this is not a service that Bojangles is providing to you.

248
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,560
This is not an option Bojangles has provided you this V-Day.

249
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,600
They're saying, when you get home, go to your freezer,

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
get your own ice cream, and hack our dessert that we made.

251
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
Hack our thing.

252
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,400
This is like when there's recipes on the back of the Ritz box,

253
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,120
and you look at it and go, and then just eat a whole sleeve dry.

254
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
Other Bojangles ideas for Valentine's Day,

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
because they're who you turn to when you need ideas for Valentine's Day,

256
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,960
you can write a love letter.

257
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,200
If you go to Bojangles.com, forward slash love,

258
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
you can create a thoughtful e-card for your family, friends,

259
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,280
or that special someone, courtesy of Bojangles.

260
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,520
No.

261
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Don't mind if I do.

262
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
For your family, friends, or side piece.

263
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,200
And you can actually get eight side pieces, which is nice.

264
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
You can even use this idea to be a community sweetheart

265
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,640
by selecting from the pre-populated list of local heroes in your community

266
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,880
to send a Valentine's Day message.

267
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,280
What the fuck are you talking about?

268
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,200
Are you saying that I'm going to send a Valentine from me and Bojangles

269
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
to the local firefighter?

270
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
What is that guy's day like?

271
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
This is what makes it all worth it.

272
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm so glad Justin appreciates me enough to send the very best,

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
a JPEG from Bojangles.

274
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm glad I put my line on the line every day now.

275
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,040
This is so worth it.

276
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,960
They don't have any for West Virginia.

277
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,920
You can send your Bojangles cards to me, local hero Justin McElroy,

278
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
father of two.

279
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,080
You can send those my way.

280
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,400
So that's how you can celebrate Valentine's Day.

281
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Thank you so much to Bojangles for giving us so many great ways

282
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,640
to make this Valentine's Day so special.

283
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,120
I'm making one right now.

284
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
Is the heart anatomical?

285
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,860
God no.

286
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,840
No, the regular Boberry biscuits look more like anatomical hearts.

287
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,360
These are just sort of fun.

288
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,680
Oh, it looks like I got an image here.

289
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
It's just a picture of a heart-shaped biscuit and it says you up.

290
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
So that's kind of a booty biscuit.

291
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,080
That's for my firefighters because I need to know they're up

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
making sure the fires don't get too wild.

293
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,960
Hey, this is weird.

294
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,840
What do we have here in the second?

295
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,840
We're just going to dovetail.

296
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,280
We're just going to dovetail right off into Firefighter Wisdom.

297
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,680
Yes.

298
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,200
Is this a segment?

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,080
I feel like maybe this is just a one-off never again segment

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
but we got our response to a question we did last week

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,680
and I wanted to address it.

302
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
Okay, well let's address it because we're already talking about firefighters.

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
Heroes that battle the blaze, as I call them.

304
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Firefighter Wisdom.

305
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,840
Trav, do you have a jingle for Firefighter Wisdom you want to do?

306
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Nope, that one's done.

307
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
That one's taken.

308
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,400
Brothers, my wife is a wildland firefighter and according to her

309
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,840
there's an unwritten rule that you never pee on the fire or its ashes.

310
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,760
The rationale is that sometimes before officially calling the fire quote-unquote out

311
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
they have to go around sticking their hands in the ashes

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
to make sure there are no hot spots and no one wants to put their hand in pee.

313
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,080
Number twos are even more frowned upon and that's from my wife is way cooler and tougher than I am.

314
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:40,400
Certainly at this, I have a tool that smushes garlic.

315
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,080
Certainly we could come up with a tool that could tell us if fires are out, right?

316
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,040
Put your hand in that.

317
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm sure we've got something better.

318
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
I have a thermometer.

319
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
Put your hand in the fire.

320
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
Put your hand in it, Jeffrey.

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
Um, because they deserve to piss on these bad, this bad hot wind.

322
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
I feel like, like they've earned it.

323
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
I feel like when you fight the blaze, um,

324
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
You could probably come up with a tool that tells you if the fire is hot and if it's been peed in.

325
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Because then you'd be like, oh nice, whoever did that, super nice.

326
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,760
Infrared and infrared yellow, maybe like a, uh, like a pee pee, uh, smelling pig.

327
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,320
Like a pig that you lead around and it's like, nope, not that pile.

328
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
That still seems pretty, like, non-technological.

329
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
At the end of the day, he's been beautifully smoked and ready for your family to enjoy.

330
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,920
Jesus.

331
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh, do you, you don't eat pigs, Griffin?

332
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,080
Not Hamptons, not the Hampton the Hero fire pig.

333
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,120
No way.

334
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,840
I would never eat Hampton the Hero fire pig.

335
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,400
A pig this special, you don't eat them all at once.

336
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,280
I love this pig.

337
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,760
Listen, my family, kids love them, except every time they make bathroom, he comes sniffing around like,

338
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,480
hey, Hampton, can you be cool for a second?

339
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm going to send a Boberry biscuit Valentine to Hampton the Hero fire pig.

340
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
Uh, recently the Starbucks near me has made their whipped cream blue.

341
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,640
I don't know why they did it and it's only this location.

342
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,000
But now every drink you order with whipped cream has blue whipped cream.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,200
It's a very ugly blue and it still tastes like normal whipped cream.

344
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Given the years of social conditioning have taught me that blue food should taste like blue,

345
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm incredibly distressed at the sight of this blue whipped cream, which still tastes like blue.

346
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
Whipped cream, which still tastes normal.

347
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,000
How can I get my local Starbucks to reverse their horrible whipped cream decisions?

348
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,720
So was this from the didn't they do like a unicorn?

349
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,280
Yes, is that what this is from?

350
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,800
Is that like a unicorn frappe with like blue and purple shits?

351
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,600
But still that that time is behind us now by like a solid year by a very large margin,

352
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:52,160
which is troubling because large margin a year is too much time for cream to just hang out.

353
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,560
If it's new blue cream, I think you need to report this Starbucks to I don't know the police

354
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,960
because you're not allowed to just sort of go your own way.

355
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,120
When you're a Starbucks, you can't be a Starbucks and be like,

356
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
hey, do you want to drip coffee or a cheeseburger?

357
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,560
And it's like, wait a minute.

358
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah, we do cheeseburgers at this one.

359
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
I just don't.

360
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,000
I understand it can make people uncomfortable to like question authority,

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,480
even if that authority is the person that runs the coffee making at Starbucks.

362
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
I get that for sure.

363
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,840
I think you are completely within your legal rights to say, why is this blue?

364
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
Explain this to me.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Excuse me, I'm a paying customer.

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah, why is this blue?

367
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
Do it again, but normal.

368
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Do it again, but normal, please.

369
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,280
No, if I'm being honest, I've just spent the last 390,

370
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,240
well, now six episodes waiting for someone to say large margin.

371
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,200
And so like, I haven't been listening at all, but I'm really going to dial in now.

372
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
Wow, I'm excited for this new era of Travis.

373
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah, where I can finally start paying attention.

374
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
The curse has been lifted.

375
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
What are we talking about?

376
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,560
What do we do on this show?

377
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
Well, let's try Yahoo, Travis's first Yahoo.

378
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,520
A what?

379
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,760
Yahoo, it's a website where people go to sort of,

380
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
just let it all be what it is.

381
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,360
And this is a segment we do on this show?

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
Yes, yeah.

383
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
It originated in our old show, Internet Says the Wildest Things.

384
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,560
2.0.

385
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,640
It was actually called www.internet-says-the-wildest-things 2.0 uploaded.

386
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
So it was very early web.

387
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
I guess that's what I'm saying.

388
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,760
And we would go to some of our favorite sort of websites and pets.com and be like,

389
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
look at this picture we found on pets.com.

390
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
Ask Jeeves.

391
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,920
Yes, we did a segment called Let's Ask Jeeves.

392
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,080
We'd be like, what's the capital of New Mexico?

393
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
And then it would tell us and we would just read it.

394
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,560
I forget what it was.

395
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,920
Anyway, a couple of people sent this one in.

396
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Thank you, everybody.

397
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,600
It's from Yahoo Answers user My Chemical Undertale, which is a real heck of a username, who asks.

398
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
I don't follow.

399
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,800
Yeah, don't worry about it.

400
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
A rusted fidget spinner?

401
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
Oh, no.

402
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,680
Okay, so last year me and my younger cousin were swimming in the pool and I found a blue fidget,

403
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
metal fidget spinner.

404
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,200
It wouldn't spin, or at least it would barely spin.

405
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I took it home because my cousin already had a fzz, which I think is fidget spinner.

406
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,560
So I put it with some other stuff and here I am in 2018.

407
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,280
It is rusted and I wonder how I can get it to spin again.

408
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,080
WD-40?

409
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,280
I want to use something that isn't chemicals, such as kitchen oil.

410
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,720
But I do not believe it will work.

411
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
What do I use?

412
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,080
I want a natural, organic, GMO-free fidget spinner.

413
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,580
What?

414
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,800
What is kitchen oil?

415
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
Like, you know.

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,760
When your kitchen starts making a weird groaning noise and so you cover it with oil to help it,

417
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,920
you know, just run a little bit smoother.

418
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Kitchen oil, Justin, is what happens when you get a little bit of,

419
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,160
and no one knows what this is, but kind of a slimy thing on like your exhaust vent.

420
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,120
Sure, okay.

421
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,760
Yes, yes, yes.

422
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
Yeah, that's your kitchen.

423
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
That's just your kitchen's natural oils.

424
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,920
It's the sweat, if you will.

425
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,520
Yeah, it's the kitchen sweat.

426
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
The kitchen's working hard.

427
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah.

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,440
The very good news for this question asker is that fidget spinners,

429
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
I don't know if you've been paying attention, they are not hard to come by.

430
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,560
If you roll 75 cents down the hall of your local mall, a fidget spinner will fly back to you.

431
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,840
There are just fidget spinners all over the place on deep, deep discount.

432
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
This fidget spinner is special.

433
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,680
This was like Lady in the Water presented to question askers.

434
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,120
Oh, it's Excalibur.

435
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,920
Yes.

436
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,120
This is, oh, I was referencing the M. Night Shyamalan movie, but yes.

437
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
And so this fidget spinner is special and needs to be revitalized.

438
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,440
Who knows what magic powers could be granted by this fidget spinner?

439
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,560
You're saying this is a mermaid's treasure that got sucked up a pipe somewhere

440
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,680
and Ariel was like, ah, fuck, where'd it go?

441
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,240
Ah, man.

442
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,480
How else would a fidget spinner just end up in a pool, Griffin?

443
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
Great, great, great question.

444
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,360
Uh, excuse me, have you checked it for curses?

445
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,920
Because the only other reason that I would get rid of a fidget spinner and leave it in the pool,

446
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm going to bury this in the briny deep so it can never hurt anybody ever again.

447
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,640
And then they throw it in the pool and now you've got the cursed fidget spinner.

448
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,600
Jumanji 3.

449
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Jumanji 3 curses a fidget spinner that's cursed.

450
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,560
Spin it and a big spinning lion comes out.

451
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,120
Oh, no.

452
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,800
Wait, well, it's okay.

453
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
He's just spinning there.

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,720
Oh, okay.

455
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
What if when you spin it, it never stops spinning?

456
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,480
What would you do?

457
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,680
Hey guys, hey guys, what would you do though?

458
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,560
If you spun a fidget spinner and you're like, ah, good spin.

459
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,680
Mm, God, this one's really going.

460
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,800
And then 15 minutes later, you're like, what am I going to do with this?

461
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,760
I mean, frankly, I just assume I was being incepted.

462
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,480
Oh, God, Inception 2, the fidget spinner just spinning on the table to let you know

463
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,920
if you're in a dream or not.

464
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,320
I mean, I would use it, since I've cracked the problem of perpetual motion,

465
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
I would use it to generate infinite energy for the earth.

466
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,760
Mm-hmm.

467
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,160
Oh, that's very good.

468
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,640
Wouldn't you be worried that if you touched it, you would break the spell and you'd die?

469
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
Um, or that it would just sort of spin right through my fingers and destroy them,

470
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,040
because it can't be, again, it can't be stopped.

471
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,560
This is an immovable object.

472
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,440
No, no, don't touch it.

473
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,680
Oh.

474
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm not sure it could be used to power a generator.

475
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,760
That was, of course, my first thought too, Griffin,

476
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,640
but the generator would rely on resistance of some sort.

477
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,680
Guess I'd put it on the back of my boat and make like a cool,

478
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,000
gas-free motorboat situation out of it.

479
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
Small, cool, small motorboat.

480
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
You gotta reduce, reuse, recycle, and you gotta save this fidget spinner.

481
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
Also, I mean, rehab addict.

482
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,520
This is Flipper, this old fidget spinner with Bob Vila.

483
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,400
Love it or list it.

484
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,280
Love it or list it.

485
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,480
Get on Craigslist.

486
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,000
I found this old fidget spinner, couldn't fix it, so I do not love it.

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,280
Here I am listing it.

488
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
$50? Is that good?

489
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
I do not know.

490
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,480
The one thing that's going to save us when the aliens come to take over our planet

491
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
is they're going to start finding fidget spinners,

492
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,840
and they're going to have to spend a lot of time piecing that one together.

493
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,200
I know.

494
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm serious, Greenblower, but look.

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,840
No, I've told you.

496
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
They all have them.

497
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,560
They must be weapons, sir.

498
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,840
They must be weapons or something.

499
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
You spin it, and that's it.

500
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,760
No.

501
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,120
What's the next thing that it-

502
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
No, there's no next thing.

503
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
You spin it, and that's it.

504
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,000
And while they're distracted, I sneak up with a shard of glass to stab them right in the back.

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,480
Whoa.

506
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:40,880
God.

507
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,320
What happened to all the knives?

508
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I was in my cage, and I broke out, and I'm doing just fine.

509
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm sure the glass will be enough to protect them.

510
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
Look at their fleshy bodies.

511
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
Surprise, motherfucker.

512
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Sheen, what are you doing?

513
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,800
Splurge.

514
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Splurge, Earth is defended, and I pick up the fidget spinner and spin it,

515
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,320
and the credits come out of it.

516
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,100
Whoa.

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
That's what it was for.

518
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Yeah.

519
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,920
It had the credits to the movie.

520
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,680
It had the credits in it.

521
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,040
The movie had been going on for eight hours, and it couldn't end,

522
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,560
because Griffin hadn't released the credits.

523
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,880
There had been a whole love bee plot and an inspiring soccer story,

524
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,640
and the movie had just gone on forever.

525
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,800
A dad learned to respect his son.

526
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,760
It was wild.

527
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
Just keep looking down at that fidget spinner, asshole.

528
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes.

529
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
Independence Day 3.

530
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
Also, Jumanji 3.

531
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,080
I can do it.

532
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
It's Independence Jumanji 3.

533
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
A movie by Griffin McElroy.

534
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
A docudrama by Griffin McElroy.

535
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
Was Griffin the first and only prisoner that the aliens took?

536
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
They got the fidget spinner, and they got distracted.

537
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,320
I tried to lead a revolution with my other prisoners.

538
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,920
They're too chicken shit.

539
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,480
I was the only one with a certain tactical ability,

540
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
needed to break out my glass cage, stab these fucking aliens.

541
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
How did they even capture you in the first place?

542
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
I was asleep, the cowards.

543
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
What did you guys think about season three of Black Mirror?

544
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Fidget spin is what if, aliens?

545
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,200
Griffin wrote this one.

546
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,080
This is all the episodes, isn't it?

547
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Sucks.

548
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
Is your first step after that,

549
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,800
to try to learn how to pilot the alien craft to fight back,

550
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,320
or to try to activate the comm system

551
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,560
to spread the word to your fellow prisoners

552
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,880
as to how the aliens can be defeated?

553
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
I mean, the second, but-

554
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,520
Choose your own adventure.

555
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
Justin, just to clarify, because I want to get this right.

556
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,000
Justin, when you say how the aliens can be defeated,

557
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
you mean by shiving them in the back, right?

558
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,000
I found their weakness.

559
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,840
While they're distracted by a fidget spinner.

560
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
That was key to the plan.

561
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,840
Okay.

562
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Oh no, I would do it all myself.

563
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,080
I think once I went into sort of my battle rage, just like-

564
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
In the words of my generation, up yours,

565
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,800
then you fly it right into the mothership.

566
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,760
Hell yeah, dude.

567
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,080
Yeah.

568
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Okay, so Griffin, I miss my brother Griffin,

569
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
who died killing all the aliens,

570
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
but I want you to know that we have made a bronze statue

571
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,640
in your honor, and I've renamed both my children Griffin,

572
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,560
and a lot of people on Earth did that too.

573
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,800
It's gonna get confusing, but we're all so proud of you.

574
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,280
And yes, the bronze statue has a fidget spinner.

575
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,880
That never stops.

576
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,800
Never stops, it's an eternal spinner.

577
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Maybe I just got so wild just killing these two aliens

578
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
that I didn't even pay attention

579
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,680
and have time to get off the ship before it exploded.

580
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
Ah, damn it.

581
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
And then there's a lesson in there about violence.

582
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,360
There's like another alien behind Griffin,

583
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,400
and they stab him with glass because they learned.

584
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,880
Damn it.

585
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,840
Oh, violence.

586
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,320
Violence is the way of this planet.

587
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,040
My people had never even thought about violence before,

588
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,880
then Griffin has introduced this idea.

589
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Yeah, and then that alien goes and looks at his two comrades

590
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,400
and is sad about their being dead.

591
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,760
And then he sees the fidget spinner,

592
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,880
he leans over and he picks it up,

593
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
and he's like, what is this thing?

594
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
And then I'm like, not today.

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
And I, one more time, get him,

596
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,600
and then smash cut because I died.

597
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
And it's Liv Tyler at my funeral.

598
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Oh, I love this, this is huge.

599
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,920
Look out behind you, Liv Tyler.

600
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,360
No, she's fine.

601
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
No, she turns around, she catches the glass,

602
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
and she says, this is for Griffin.

603
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,120
And then, yeah, oh man, this is good.

604
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,560
And she pushes the alien backward and her,

605
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,720
let's say she's got like a monkey partner,

606
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,360
and he's crashed down behind her, or behind the alien,

607
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,040
the alien falls backwards.

608
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm so glad you got back to Garbanzo,

609
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,040
the monkey partner, Travis, because-

610
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
Liv Tyler's like, that's it, I'm getting too old for this shit.

611
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,520
I retire.

612
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,160
And then Griffin Jr., who had been there the whole time

613
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
and is a fully grown man, said-

614
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,040
It's actually Griffin's twin brother named Griffin Jr.

615
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,600
Yes.

616
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm gonna take up the mantle for now on, Mom,

617
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,240
which is this cute nickname for Liv Tyler, his sister-in-law.

618
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
And Griffin Jr. decides he's gonna finish the fight

619
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
that his dad couldn't.

620
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,360
His dad brother.

621
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,080
His dad brother.

622
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,440
His dad brother.

623
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,600
Dad was his nickname for his brother.

624
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,160
And guess what?

625
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Good news, Griffin is not really dead.

626
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,520
They just, his spirit's in the void.

627
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
So they gotta go into the void-

628
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,400
Justin, save something for Jumanji Independence 4.

629
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't worry, you end up in the body of Garbanzo.

630
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
I love this.

631
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
And when I look into a mirror, it's just me in a big diaper,

632
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
but everybody else sees Garbanzo.

633
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,920
Everybody else just sees Garbanzo,

634
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,720
but I see myself as just me in a big diaper,

635
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
holding two big shards of glass,

636
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,800
ready for any alien fucks that wanna try to fuck

637
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,160
with my fucking planet.

638
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,240
You guessed it, everybody, he is pregnant.

639
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,880
And the baby is voiced by Dana DeVito.

640
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
Whoa, what a git.

641
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,640
Yeah.

642
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
Did we jump the shark a little bit?

643
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,800
Cause I think we had a good movie in there somewhere,

644
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
but then there was like a fourth act

645
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
and then a fifth act and then the sixth act.

646
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,320
He'll edit it down.

647
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah.

648
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,440
It's fine.

649
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,940
Jameson?

650
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Jameson, if you could just edit it down.

651
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
Jameson, I think Justin forgot your fucking name, dude.

652
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit,

653
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,720
but he'll edit his name back in, which is perfect.

654
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,480
Oh, are you talking about Jameson?

655
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,960
That's right, Griffin, Jameson.

656
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Let's go to the money time.

657
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:49,120
Thank you, Christ.

658
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,400
I want to tell you about Casper mattresses.

659
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,320
Okay.

660
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,880
Thank you.

661
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,840
Casper mattress, it's the best mattress I have ever slept upon.

662
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,960
I was gone for many nights on the cruise and traveling

663
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,760
and all of that.

664
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,400
And listen, I slept fine, but then I came home.

665
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,920
I slept on that Casper mattress.

666
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,720
It embraced me like a lover and I had missed it.

667
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,480
And they offer affordable prices

668
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,400
because Casper cuts out the middleman

669
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
and sells directly to the consumer.

670
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
It's pretty amazing.

671
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,240
And listen, I know you've heard about this before,

672
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,080
but and I can't get over this technology comes in a box.

673
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,840
In a box, you open it up, it's there.

674
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
It's amazing.

675
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
And it's like a little pill that you put in the bathtub

676
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
and it turns into a dinosaur.

677
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
Absolutely.

678
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
And it combines multiple supportive memory phones

679
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
for quality sleep service

680
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
with the right amount of both sync and bounce.

681
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,440
You can be sure of your purchase

682
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

683
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280

688
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,800
These are weird stickers that have cool pictures on them.

689
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,280
Slow down.

690
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,200
And yeah, they're cool stickers

691
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,280
and they're worth a certain amount of money.

692
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,160
And when you put them on,

693
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,760
you stick them right on the outside of the letter.

694
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,320
And that's important.

695
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't put it on the actual paper itself on the inside.

696
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
When you send it off,

697
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,160
people look at how much money it's worth

698
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,640
and says like, okay, I'll ship it for this much.

699
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
And stamps.com has taken this process

700
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,480
and made it as convenient and easy and reliable

701
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720

709
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,640

click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

716
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,520

718
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,640

It's all one word.

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
So remember that, remember the microphone,

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
remember our twisted fucking humor, dude.

725
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,400
Next time you're gonna play taste my steel

726
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
or you're playing an upcoming cosplay,

727
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,840
you won't have to grift a deals warlock

728
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,600
to get your own OP weapon at Adventure Armory.

729
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
They specialize in wooden swords, shields, and accessories

730
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
with both original styles and those inspired

731
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,280
by your favorite video games, anime, and movies.

732
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,440

They gladly accept customer requests

735
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,440

736
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
including weapons of our own design

737
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
and often work with hardwoods upon request

738
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,360
for spar ready weaponry.

739
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,680
Don't base hitting on RIP or you will go to jail.

740
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,480
Visit sexygarfield.adventurearmory.com.

741
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,120
That's Armory with a U for 10% off your order.

742
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,560
It's one site you won't want blasted from your cash.

743
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,000
A lot of great references

744
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
that we didn't even have to put in there.

745
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,720
They just did it for us.

746
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,960
So thank you, Adventure Armory.

747
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,760
It's dope.

748
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,560
Yeah, it's really sick.

749
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,600
I'm looking at their catalog now

750
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,360
and they do have My Hero Glass Shard

751
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,720
from Adventure Jumanji 3.

752
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
A lot of stuff on here is pretty high touch.

753
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,040
This just looks like they maybe just like

754
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,640
shattered a glass top table

755
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,600
and dipped it in alien blood.

756
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,480
They've got a lot of great stuff on here.

757
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,040
They have a wooden replica of Rowan Atkinson's wallet

758
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,760
from Johnny English,

759
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,400
which was not a big prop in the movie.

760
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,760
But they do have that.

761
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,440
Yeah, they got exactly like it.

762
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,160
It looks great.

763
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,560
They have a wooden The Tuxedo

764
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,400
from Jackie Chan's The Tuxedo

765
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,560
and that one looks really good.

766
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,280
Yes.

767
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,920
Trav, you got an obscure action comedy in here

768
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
that you wanna reference a prop from?

769
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
No, they have one of the sticks

770
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
that The Rock used in the rundown

771
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,840
before he was allowed to use guns,

772
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,680
but none of the guns, which I appreciate.

773
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,840
Travis, you wanna read this next Jumbotron?

774
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,640
Yeah, I do.

775
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,680
Okay, this is for Daniel, Kat, Cheyenne, Bond.

776
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
It's from Jacob.

777
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,560
Dear my fantastic friends Cheyenne, Kat, Daniel, and Bond.

778
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm so happy we've been able to D&D together

779
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,280
or didn't do it together.

780
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,560
It's really made me the happiest I've ever been.

781
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,160
I love you all very much.

782
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:38,080
And hopefully Tala, Karaya, Myla, and Chev

783
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,960
are still well by the time this is read.

784
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,480
Special shout out to our amazing Daniel.

785
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
The world you made has made this pot.

786
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,480
That might've been DM.

787
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
The world you made has made this possible.

788
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,440
This is, it sounds like a pretty good group.

789
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,080
And definitely like two of them have been dissolved

790
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,840
by like a dragon's acid.

791
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
All of the first season of adventures

792
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,920
and all I wanna do is dissolve you in a dragon's acid.

793
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,440
They hit you with a dragon's curse.

794
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, when we do the special edition re-release,

795
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,880
you can edit that in.

796
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,200
Episode one, man.

797
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
Dragon's gonna curse you with his magic acid.

798
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,720
Y'all are fucked.

799
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Here's a message for Luke and Laura

800
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
and it's from Jack Mac and Bug.

801
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,600
You say, happy late birthday, Luke and Laura.

802
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
We've hijacked these sweet McElroy gobs

803
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
to let you know how much we love you.

804
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,240
You guys married some incredible people

805
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,200
and we're so proud.

806
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
We look up to you.

807
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
The way you pursue what matters to you,

808
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,520
how deeply you care for your loved ones.

809
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,720
Keep working hard in life

810
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,520
and searching for peanut butter fingerprints.

811
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,960
Oh man, what's the peanut butter crime

812
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,320
they're trying to solve with these PB fingerprints?

813
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,280
Well, it was committed by a guy named Steve Peanut Butter.

814
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
Travis, what does that even mean?

815
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
They're looking for peanut butter fingerprints.

816
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
So you just willed into existence

817
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,560
and Justin's just gone now,

818
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,600
but you just willed into existence-

819
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,040
Yeah, I don't have anything to add to this.

820
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
A guy named Steve Peanut Butter

821
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
for the purpose of this joke.

822
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,160
You've added to the Bim Bam canon,

823
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,680
you're hoping that Steve Peanut Butter

824
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,200
is gonna be like the next YouTube animatic.

825
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,720
Would it be better if it was like P,

826
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
initial P, not butter?

827
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,080
No, don't lock it back.

828
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,680
It's Steve Peanut Butter

829
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,920
and I want you to tell us more about Steve Peanut Butter

830
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,280
and this is in the animatic now.

831
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,120
He stole the bread and got himself in a jam.

832
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,720
Christ, Jesus God in heaven on the high mountain

833
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,080
looking down on us all.

834
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
Do you wish you made that joke?

835
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,160
Are you jelly?

836
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,160
The podcast is canceled.

837
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,480
Oh no.

838
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
The podcast is now canceled.

839
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Hi, I'm Ben.

840
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
And I'm Adam.

841
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
And we host The Greatest Generation

842
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
and we're here to announce a new show.

843
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,400
The Greatest Discovery is Maximum Fun's new podcast

844
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,520
about the new Star Trek series, Star Trek Discovery.

845
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,080
We're gonna be recapping every single episode.

846
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,880
It's gonna be a limited run podcast

847
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
and we hope you'll join us.

848
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,960
It's a show that we're really excited to watch

849
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,120
and we're really excited to talk about it

850
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,720
and provide our signature f***ing fart joke coverage

851
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,400
of a new entry in the Star Trek franchise.

852
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,160
So if you like irreverence, adult humor,

853
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,680
irreverence again, and Star Trek,

854
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,120
we really hope you'll join us on Tuesdays on Maximum Fun

855
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
or wherever you get your podcasts

856
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,160
to The Greatest Discovery.

857
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,200
Oh, they made us edit f*** out of the last promo

858
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,160
that we submitted.

859
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
So you should keep that part in the promo.

860
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,120
The toilet paper in my office's bathroom

861
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,480
is basically printer paper.

862
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,400
Is it?

863
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,080
I want to talk to you about your use of office supplies.

864
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,400
Is it collated printer paper with the dot matrix holes

865
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,880
on the side?

866
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,360
I want to start bringing my own to work,

867
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,880
but I'm worried about being caught

868
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
carrying my own TP to and from the bathroom

869
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,640
and having to explain to my coworkers

870
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,240
about my sensitive butt.

871
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
Any ideas for how to do this covertly?

872
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,120
And that's from Lacerated on Long Island.

873
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,400
Christ, no.

874
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
A costume party, you're a mummy.

875
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,640
Every day.

876
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,160
And as the day goes on, you're less and less of a mummy

877
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,200
and people track sort of how your digestive system's doing

878
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,840
based on how much mummy you are by five o'clock.

879
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,200
Uh-oh, half mummy, huh?

880
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,440
Rough day, huh?

881
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
Buffalo wings, huh?

882
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,200
Yippies.

883
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,920
If you do this right,

884
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,000
you really only got to sneak it in there once

885
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,880
and then you kind of heavyweight squirrel it away

886
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,400
in the wall.

887
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,760
Maybe you have a poster.

888
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
Acoustic tile in the ceiling, perhaps.

889
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah, you have a poster of

890
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,360
the poster from Shawshank, Jameson, Jameson, Jameson, anything, Jameson.

891
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
It's Rita Hayworth, right?

892
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,600
God.

893
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,560
That's one of them.

894
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
But I also think Cars 3 was in there.

895
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
Yeah, he had a poster.

896
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,280
He tore down the Rita Hayworth poster.

897
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
There was nothing behind it.

898
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
It was just a regular wall and you're like, okay.

899
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Well, it's probably not behind the Cars 3 one.

900
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,280
Andy knew, Andy Dufresne knew that someday

901
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,640
there would be a popular animated franchise based on Cars

902
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
and he knew there would be at least three of them.

903
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,960
So Andy, on his spare time, used to create his own Cars

904
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
related posters and merchandise.

905
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,520
Every time he got a sharp object and some soap,

906
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,160
he'd start carving new figures based on this animated franchise

907
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,560
he was sure would someday exist.

908
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
What is that piece of soap called?

909
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
Well, that's not soap.

910
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,760
That's a Lightning McQueen, he would say.

911
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
This is his buddy, Tomato.

912
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
The fastest car on the track.

913
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
This is his buddy, Tomato.

914
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,880
There will also be a man named Larry the Cable Person.

915
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,760
He had another poster for planes,

916
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,360
but he only ever made one.

917
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,280
It's not gonna take off, he said with a twinkle in his eye.

918
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Andy loved a good pun.

919
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,960
You're worried about like, you're being made fun of.

920
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,240
I would more worry that like,

921
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,320
you're gonna go to the trouble of bringing in your own TP

922
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,320
and everyone's going to covet said TP and steal it from you.

923
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,920
Yeah, and that's bad.

924
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,280
You're gonna have to lock that drawer.

925
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,360
You're gonna have to lock that drawer.

926
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,960
The TP, your special TP, well,

927
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
you gotta build the TP drawer

928
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
and then you have to lock it with your special code.

929
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,720
You can offer to take a pay cut

930
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
and then they would know you're like really serious

931
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,280
about how bad the toilet paper is.

932
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,000
Like, listen, seriously, pay me 3% less

933
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,600
and buy better toilet paper.

934
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
If it works, you'll be an office hero.

935
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,600
Everyone will appreciate your sacrifice.

936
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,120
Can you not just strike or march or something?

937
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,480
This is not tenable and everybody has to know

938
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,680
unless you're working with a bunch of iron clad asshole

939
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,240
having like, you know what I mean?

940
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,160
Like some real sort of callous sitters.

941
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,440
If West Virginia teachers can strike for something as silly

942
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
as being able to afford their own healthcare,

943
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,480
certainly you can strike to have some high quality TP.

944
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
Can you not go to another office building

945
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,080
to do your twosies?

946
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,640
You mean quit?

947
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,440
Get a new job?

948
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
So I see here you worked a job but you just quit.

949
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,480
What was your reason for leaving?

950
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,920
My butthole.

951
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,520
What attracts you to this job?

952
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,080
Do you have skills in customer service?

953
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,920
No, it's just you got that quilted stuff

954
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,400
and it's been kissed with lotion and I need to know.

955
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,200
I just gotta know.

956
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
I need some time to recuperate

957
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,040
and I am gonna go back to my old job

958
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,560
once I've sort of recovered.

959
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,280
It's the problem with me using

960
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,400
Cottonelle Ultra Comfort Care at home exclusively.

961
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
Everything that I use in the outside world

962
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
because nobody's springing.

963
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,840
Love that stuff.

964
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,800
Barely there.

965
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
Barely there TP.

966
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
I mean nobody is springing for that kind of stuff.

967
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,760
Justin, you have ruined my bathroom experience

968
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,520
anywhere but my own office.

969
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,160
Sure, yeah.

970
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,920
Justin got me a bidet for Christmas.

971
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,920
Have we not talked about this on the show?

972
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
I'm loving it.

973
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,440
Yeah, cancel the rest of the show.

974
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,160
I got, we were looking for the perfect Christmas gift

975
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,400
and I was like, I looked at Sydney,

976
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,840
I was like Sydney, I did it.

977
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,680
I found the gift of the year.

978
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
The one gift that will be most treasured

979
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
and prized above all others

980
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
and she did not trust me in the moment

981
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
but I knew when I handed my brother Travis

982
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,360
his own bidet.

983
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,720
His own butt super soaker.

984
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:16,960
Yep.

985
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,120
How's it been, Travis?

986
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,400
First off, let's talk about insulation.

987
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,960
How did that go?

988
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,640
Well, it was a little tricky

989
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,120
because I had to find a plug to plug it in

990
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,480
because it's just the seat, right?

991
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,120
So it's not, I didn't replace the whole toilet, mind you.

992
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,480
It's just a seat swap.

993
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,280
But Justin, it's been amazing and life changing

994
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,520
and now when I go out into the world

995
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,400
and I use any restroom but my own,

996
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
I think, oh my God, how did I live like this

997
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,560
before Poseidon took care of my downstairs for me?

998
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,200
Is it sustained action

999
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,120
or do you like lean on a button

1000
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,960
and just it continues to spray

1001
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,400
or you press a button and it blasts you?

1002
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,240
I press the button and the bidet is like,

1003
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,440
you got it chief

1004
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,080
and it just takes care of business.

1005
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,440
And it has its whole routine?

1006
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,080
Yeah.

1007
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,200
Do you have a number of usages

1008
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,080
of the bidet in sequence

1009
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,560
before you are beginning to worry

1010
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,680
that it has become sexual?

1011
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,280
Let's explore, okay.

1012
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
Well, I do want to explore bidet

1013
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,080
because is that the Bojangles bidet?

1014
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,400
It's actually Tom Bojangles bidet.

1015
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:20,720
Okay.

1016
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,000
Travis, please stop hiding

1017
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,880
you fucking coward from the sexual bidet question.

1018
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,840
Well, I do like,

1019
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
you can't see while it's happening.

1020
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,000
You try to lift up,

1021
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,280
it's gonna go everywhere in the room.

1022
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,080
Maybe you can't.

1023
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,960
I took a bunch of yoga in college.

1024
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,600
Okay.

1025
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
And so if I can position myself

1026
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
like so I get it on the first try,

1027
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,880
let's say, you know what I mean,

1028
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,400
without any repositioning,

1029
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,880
I just feel like-

1030
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,320
A 360 noscope.

1031
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,440
We're doing it together,

1032
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,440
taking care of business.

1033
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,960
It's the weirdest buddy cop movie

1034
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,920
I've ever been a part of,

1035
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,080
but I really enjoy it.

1036
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
Listen, I'm a big fan.

1037
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,120
It's got lots of options.

1038
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,080
I can heat the seat and the water.

1039
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,960
Oh, yeah.

1040
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,240
Highly recommend.

1041
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,640
Highly recommend.

1042
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,120
One time.

1043
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,280
It's a luxury I never knew I needed

1044
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,920
and now I simply cannot live without.

1045
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,440
Gotta heat the water.

1046
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,480
I gotta tell you folks,

1047
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,840
it's surprisingly affordable.

1048
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
You just legally can't buy one for yourself.

1049
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,240
Yes.

1050
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,120
You understand?

1051
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,000
Y'all want a yahoo?

1052
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,600
Yeah, absolutely.

1053
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,640
You kidding me?

1054
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,320
This one is sent in by Morgan Davey.

1055
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,360
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

1056
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user,

1057
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,320
but I'll call them.

1058
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,240
Robert asks,

1059
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
when people say Great Scott,

1060
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
who is the Scott they are referring to?

1061
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,600
Scott Bakla.

1062
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,760
It might be Scott Bakla,

1063
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
but let's come back to that.

1064
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,920
It's Sir Walter Scott.

1065
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,720
Did you Google that, Justin?

1066
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,000
I just Googled it.

1067
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,120
I mean, there's an answer to this question.

1068
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,680
Oh, well, okay.

1069
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,880
Well, then no jokes required.

1070
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,240
Let's do a different yahoo.

1071
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,800
No, Justin.

1072
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,760
Justin's got a good point.

1073
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,240
I got it.

1074
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,880
I got it covered.

1075
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,920
If there's an answer to it,

1076
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,960
there can't be jokes.

1077
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,640
So let's just do a different one, I think.

1078
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,280
Here's the thing.

1079
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,480
Here's what I'm trying to say with this.

1080
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,920
I'm trying to save us a thousand tweets

1081
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,520
from people who will check Wikipedia.

1082
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:07,840
Good, good, good.

1083
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
And they will say it is about Sir Walter Scott

1084
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,520
or possibly Winifred Scott,

1085
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,560
a US general.

1086
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:12,960
Okay.

1087
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,880
But maybe it's about whatever Scott you want.

1088
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
Maybe for me, it's Willard Scott, Justin.

1089
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:16,880
You don't know.

1090
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,920
You can't tell me who my Great Scott is.

1091
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,400
No, Travis.

1092
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
There's a no, no, no, no, there's a right answer for it.

1093
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
So let's just take the rest of the bit.

1094
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
I had a whole, let me take this big stack

1095
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
of Scott Stapp jokes I had and let me just,

1096
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,240
I'm going to go flush these down the toilet

1097
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,120
one page at a time.

1098
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,240
So I'll be right back.

1099
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Now, when you say jokes, does it mainly boil down

1100
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,120
to just saying maybe it's Scott Stapp from Creed?

1101
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
That might be where sort of how I got into the bit.

1102
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,480
But you know how our twisted comedy works.

1103
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,240
We go to other places.

1104
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,720
So just wait.

1105
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
I'm going to go flush these down the toilet one by one

1106
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,040
and you guys go ahead and talk about whatever.

1107
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,720
And I'll be back in like 28 minutes or so, 30 minutes.

1108
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,920
How about you instead you read another Yahoo

1109
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,040
and then flush them afterwards?

1110
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,840
OK, sure.

1111
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,800
Just real quick, though, if there is a correct answer

1112
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
to this one, are you going to sort of,

1113
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,920
because I have some jokes ready for this one.

1114
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,480
And if you're going to.

1115
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,280
Yeah, I will continue.

1116
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,040
If there's a correct answer, I will always say it

1117
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,400
because I don't want to get the tweets.

1118
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,920
OK, OK, OK, OK.

1119
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
Do you guys like that character?

1120
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,080
I do.

1121
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,880
I like that a lot.

1122
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,640
Tony Clifton.

1123
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,680
It's just like, OK.

1124
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,120
OK.

1125
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,880
This is sent by Nate Smith.

1126
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,520
Thank you, Nate.

1127
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,000
Boy, the wind's really out of my sails.

1128
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,880
Yeah, Griffin, can I just say this?

1129
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
And we can cut this if we need to.

1130
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,360
I felt like you were really building up a lot of momentum.

1131
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,040
I could see where you were going with that question.

1132
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,120
Oh, dude, he's on fire.

1133
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,000
I had the heat.

1134
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,560
You had it.

1135
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,200
You were there.

1136
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,480
I was like, oh, yeah.

1137
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,320
Griffin wouldn't have read this question unless he

1138
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,520
was going somewhere with it.

1139
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,840
Yeah, but hey, Justin came in and he won the segment.

1140
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,760
And he did, as we've always done,

1141
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
answered the actual answer to questions.

1142
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,320
Nothing funny.

1143
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,720
Yep.

1144
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,360
Listen, no bells and whistles here on My Brother, My Brother

1145
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:57,600
and Me.

1146
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,800
Justin saw an opportunity to take match points.

1147
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,600
And Travis and I are just salty here because we lost.

1148
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,080
We lost.

1149
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,120
That's what it is, you know?

1150
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,000
It's not about what's it funny.

1151
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,880
That's not what our show is.

1152
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,440
I know this isn't normally like a trivia show,

1153
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,280
but if there is an answer to it.

1154
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,760
Yeah, sure.

1155
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,720
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1156
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,520
This has always been, first and foremost, a factual show,

1157
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:19,920
Justin.

1158
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,960
You are absolutely correct.

1159
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,440
Thank you.

1160
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,120
Nate Smith sent this one in.

1161
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,520
Thank you, Nate.

1162
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Angelina J.

1163
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,360
What's two plus two?

1164
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,500
Yeah.

1165
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,720
There's a rich vein there.

1166
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,080
How to build a cozy nook for having sex.

1167
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,280
My bed is too squeaky squeaky.

1168
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,960
So I want to build a nook with pillows.

1169
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,720
I want to build a nook with pillows, blankets.

1170
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,360
Any ideas?

1171
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,640
Any ideas of websites that sell a lot of cozy satin stuff?

1172
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,960
Just a sex nook.

1173
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,080
A nook for sex with maybe like a nice bay window.

1174
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,840
Eventually you will have too many pillows

1175
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,760
and it will no longer be a sex nook.

1176
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,640
It'll be like a fun just sort of squished corner.

1177
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
I was up because you're not going to be able to get the proper,

1178
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,160
you know, moves.

1179
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,800
I was about to Google property brother sex nook

1180
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,600
and then I became really worried about what would be returned

1181
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,120
from those particular search terms.

1182
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,280
You don't need that fanfiction in your life.

1183
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,760
I do not.

1184
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,520
Delete, delete, delete.

1185
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,120
Backspace, backspace, backspace.

1186
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,880
Blast the cache.

1187
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,760
You hear me typing?

1188
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,720
I ain't afraid.

1189
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,520
Oh no, Griffin.

1190
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,880
I'm afraid.

1191
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
If you want a cozy nook for making nookie,

1192
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400
what's the secret?

1193
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,440
Because I do think you could repurpose a breakfast nook

1194
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,960
for this very purpose.

1195
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,480
Nobody's using the breakfast nook.

1196
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
Nobody uses the breakfast nook.

1197
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,000
Let's put the tiger on the table.

1198
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
Nobody's using breakfast nook.

1199
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,440
Basically nobody's using dining room.

1200
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,560
And you eat your meals at the, you know,

1201
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,800
on the couch while watching Shark Tank.

1202
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,120
That's-

1203
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,840
We don't have a dining room.

1204
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,120
We're not going to have a dining room.

1205
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,520
No need.

1206
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,400
I don't have a dining room.

1207
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,600
Don't need a dining room.

1208
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,120
No, we're a Shark Tank family.

1209
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,440
I have my meals with Mark.

1210
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,560
Me and Kevin are having some Brussels sprouts

1211
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,360
and pork chops tonight.

1212
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,080
Do you think when Shark Tank was being developed,

1213
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,920
do you think that Mark Cuban was like,

1214
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,200
well, we'll just call it Mark Tank.

1215
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,720
And everybody else was like,

1216
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,400
but then I want my name in it too.

1217
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
And then for a while it was called like Mark Tank

1218
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,520
featuring Kevin and the other one.

1219
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,080
He wasn't on until a few seasons in, so probably not.

1220
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,600
It might've been, he might've petitioned it

1221
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,320
when he joined to change it to Mark Tank.

1222
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,600
Yeah, in the first 10 episodes,

1223
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,800
he just tried to sneak it in there.

1224
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,560
Like what I love here about Mark Tank

1225
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,880
and people are like, what, did he say Mark Tank?

1226
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,640
You know what, I'll tell you what.

1227
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,680
I'll tell you what.

1228
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,720
I'm going to flip a coin.

1229
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,600
Heads, you change it to Mark Tank.

1230
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Tails, I changed my name to Shark Cuban.

1231
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,200
You take your breakfast nook

1232
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,160
and you put a bunch of pillows in it

1233
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,280
and that's where you make your dirty.

1234
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,600
Well, and then also maybe put a Keurig in there.

1235
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,240
So you do want to keep some of the features of the breakfast.

1236
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,080
Well, I'm just saying like, here's the thing.

1237
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,920
No room, like you wouldn't go into a bedroom

1238
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
and there's just a bed in it.

1239
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,840
You wouldn't go into an office and there's just a desk.

1240
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,520
That's a poor use of space.

1241
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,680
So yes, you can make a sex nook,

1242
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,760
but like maybe also put like some art in there

1243
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,240
and like maybe a little shelf with some books on it.

1244
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,480
So then it can be your sex nook or your book nook.

1245
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,320
Don't just like make it one nook.

1246
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,120
That's no, that's a waste of nook.

1247
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,520
What other sort of stuff do you need?

1248
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
Because you list pillows and blankets,

1249
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,520
but like you probably need some other stuff

1250
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,360
if you really want to blast off.

1251
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,000
Mm-hmm.

1252
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,040
Maybe just some various like bars for like grabbing

1253
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,840
and so you can get torque, you know?

1254
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,880
Yeah, dude.

1255
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
Just different handholds, you know, for torque.

1256
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,320
Yeah, maybe like rock climber handholds like on the wall.

1257
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,760
And then people will be like, what is this?

1258
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,880
And be like, it's my climbing wall.

1259
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,720
And if I fall down, I got all these pillows

1260
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,560
and sexual magazines to catch me.

1261
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,600
You probably-

1262
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,280
I'm not talking about nudie rags either.

1263
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,080
I'm talking about like stuff with tips in it.

1264
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,480
You're probably gonna need a pull chain

1265
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,080
that activates a sort of Rube Goldbergian system

1266
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,040
that dumps Gatorade on you after you finish.

1267
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,520
Yeah, or while you've been during the finish.

1268
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:18,880
That's up to you.

1269
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,760
Maybe a magic eye poster.

1270
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,000
A magic eye poster, that is fun.

1271
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,360
To help you last longer.

1272
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,840
You're like, I'm looking for the boat

1273
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,880
so I can't focus on the great feelings of this encounter.

1274
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,520
I found the boat.

1275
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,360
I'm so sorry.

1276
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,280
I found it really fast.

1277
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,160
I'm so sorry.

1278
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,120
I really miss Extreme Restraints.

1279
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:43,920
I do too.

1280
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,640
Follow them on Twitter.

1281
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,800
It's a fun kind of surprise

1282
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,320
as you're scrolling through your Twitter feed

1283
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
and you're just like, oh man, a lot of bad news.

1284
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,080
Oh, dildo.

1285
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,040
Y'all get at us.

1286
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,920
Let's work this out.

1287
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,840
Come on, bring back to us.

1288
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,640
Let's work this out.

1289
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,160
Is that an episode?

1290
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,120
How long have we been going?

1291
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,880
That feels like an episode to me.

1292
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,520
Justin McElroy, host of My Brother, My Brother.

1293
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,480
We're good, baby.

1294
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,520
We're golden.

1295
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,320
Justin, how do you feel?

1296
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,840
Because I know you were worried at the beginning.

1297
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,280
Do you think we ever got into it?

1298
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,160
I think that if you look back on this episode,

1299
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,240
you will remember the good

1300
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,480
and the bad is already in the rear view.

1301
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,160
You know, time will melt away the bad

1302
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,240
and only the classic animatics will remain.

1303
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,400
When we got Peter Peanut Butter, it was so good.

1304
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,640
That's a gift.

1305
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,800
That was a gift Travis gave me and Justin.

1306
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,520
You're all welcome.

1307
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,040
What would be great is if we could close this out

1308
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,800
with some good Oscar jokes

1309
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,320
because then it kind of brings it up

1310
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,320
because we were sitting on some the whole time

1311
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,080
that it was all very deliberate.

1312
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,560
Yeah, yeah.

1313
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,040
So it would be like, I saw the post and it was like,

1314
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,800
well, you got the one post.

1315
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:00,160
When are you going to finish building the fence?

1316
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,960
What are the other ones?

1317
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,840
I know the shape of water.

1318
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,000
It's all gushy and everywhere

1319
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,720
unless you put it in a tank or something.

1320
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,680
And that's good to have that one

1321
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,560
in case they do cut out

1322
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
my literally identical joke from the beginning.

1323
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,680
Well, let me try one.

1324
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,600
It's a shame that three billboards

1325
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,000
is going to get beat by four billboards.

1326
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,520
Hey, you two get out of town.

1327
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,880
Any other movies?

1328
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,960
No, that's it.

1329
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,080
No, there's a bunch of nominees.

1330
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,640
There are?

1331
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,200
I saw Call Me By Your Name.

1332
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,160
I had a peachy time.

1333
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,840
Is that, was that a joke or?

1334
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,960
There's a scene where there's this sexual peach.

1335
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,280
Dunkirk is actually based on the series finale

1336
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,360
of Growing Pains because they looked at them

1337
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,200
and they were like, we're Dunkirk.

1338
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,400
Fuck, dude.

1339
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,520
Fuck, yeah.

1340
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,320
Phantom Thread?

1341
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,480
Hell yeah, Kojima finally getting his due.

1342
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,760
Yeah, dude, fuck yes.

1343
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,400
Okay, one more.

1344
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,200
Finish it out strong.

1345
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,680
Justin Darkest Hour, go.

1346
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,400
Darkest Hour?

1347
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,480
That's the hour before the Oscars are on

1348
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,240
because I'll be really sad until it starts.

1349
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,320
Fuck yeah.

1350
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,080
I, Tanya, I excited.

1351
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,520
I, Karamba.

1352
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,120
Thank you to the Maximum Fund Network

1353
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,920
is having us as part of their extended podcasting family.

1354
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,760
Unfortunately, that relationship is now over

1355
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,280
because they did listen to this episode

1356
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,680
and they said, not feeling it anymore, I don't think.

1357
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,320
I don't see why they would necessarily do that.

1358
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,000
I think that they would probably want to support us.

1359
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,520
Even in our Darkest Hour.

1360
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:33,840
What?

1361
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,360
We found it.

1362
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,880
We got there.

1363
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,840
He did it, he did it.

1364
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,400
Griffin, please thank John Roderick.

1365
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,280
John, thanks, bud, for the use of our theme song

1366
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,960
instead of part you're off the album putting the days to bed.

1367
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,280
And if you like the stuff we did here today,

1368
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,120
go to McElroyShows.com

1369
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,200
and you can find a lot more stuff like it.

1370
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
Oh, a couple of things.

1371
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,080
One, Schmaners, the show that my wife and I do

1372
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,800
is going to be at Moon Tower Comedy Festival,

1373
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,120
April 18th in Austin, Texas.

1374
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,920
You can get tickets at bit.ly slash moon tower schmaners.

1375
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,400
S-H-M-A-N-N-E-R-S.

1376
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,920
Also, we have got a new merch store.

1377
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,480
It's going to be up soon.

1378
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,280
Yeah, I think that's either going to be

1379
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,000
at the end of this week or beginning of next week,

1380
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,040
but it's coming soon.

1381
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,400
Whole bunch of new stuff.

1382
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,200
When it works, it will be at McElroyMerch.com

1383
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,560
when it is up and running.

1384
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,600
It's going to be, it's so much new stuff.

1385
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,200
I'm so excited for y'all to see it.

1386
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,800
Let's finish it.

1387
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,720
This was sent in by Nate Smith.

1388
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,920
It's the final Yahoo of the show.

1389
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,400
Thank you, Nate.

1390
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,880
It's Yahoo Answers user Pete who asks,

1391
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,760
how do I cure my Randy Quaid phobia?

1392
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,960
My name is Justin McElroy.

1393
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1394
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1395
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,400
This has been my brother, my brother,

1396
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:12,880
and me, Kiss Your Dad, Square on the Lips.

1397
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,000
Going into a Bullseye interview,

1398
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,880
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

1399
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,480
but it's an actual conversation.

1400
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,760
I don't know where it's headed.

1401
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,480
Absolutely.

1402
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,520
You're absolutely right.

1403
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,120
You said it actually better than I did,

1404
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,960
so I have to think about what that means.

1405
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,600
Hey, this is the straight talk

1406
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,040
that you're going to get on this show.

1407
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,480

1408
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,920
