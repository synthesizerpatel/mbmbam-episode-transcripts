1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,360
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Just flipping through the old My Brother,

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,680
My Brother, and Me calendar, every week it's a new picture of Robert Loja every month.

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,880
It's the world's only week-by-week calendar. It's more like a novel.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,360
This tells me nothing about our current chronological placement in the month or year,

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,680
but it is Thursday. I know for sure as shit it's Thursday, though. Ask me what day it is.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Right now, it's a picture of Robert Loja in a backpack, and he's giving a thumbs

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
up, and he's on a skateboard, because that means it's back to school time here in America.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
Is he wearing a little propeller hat? Is he carrying a Pacific Rim lunchbox?

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:45,760
He's got like a tassel cap that's like best of 99 or something, like a cap, like a tassel cap.

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, because just like when you go for a job interview, you should always dress for one step

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,960
higher than you're going for, so just go ahead and dress like you're graduating college on your first

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,760
day. That confuses a lot of people. Back-to-school time can always be intimidating if you're a teen,

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,880
and we wanted to give you some advice, some unsolicited advice, about how to make the most

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,040
of back-to-school time. I watched that documentary about going back to school,

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
and like what colors to wear. It's called Orange is the New Black, and what I learned was don't

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,480
insult the cafeteria food, or they'll feed you a bloody tampon. Trav, I thought like the over-under

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,680
on you about to make a Rodney Dangerfield goof was like 90-10, and the fact that you bucked to

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
those odds is like astonishing to me. Yeah, can I left field, you know what I mean? Here's what I'd

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,360
like to say. No more games. What do you mean by that? Just when you go back to school this year,

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,000
no more games. Do you mean like stop playing Pokemon? No, just like enough fooling around,

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
you know. Oh, you want these high schoolers to just be more direct. No more drama. I'm not

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
playing with you anymore. Teach. Give me my A. Right. Well, that's not how like education works.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm not playing anymore. No more games. I'm tired of this back and forth where I give you a paper

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,480
and put a number on it. Justin, you're describing though like the fundamental core of like what this

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,080
facility is. It's not games as much as it is like the entirety of like what school is. Why does

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,040
education have to be gamified? Why can't they just trust that you are learning and you trust that

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
what they're saying makes sense and is true? I don't grade the teacher when I go in. I don't say

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,840
like A+. I didn't fall asleep. I mean there are there are like surveys and like a standardized

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,080
testing is kind of. Survey says. Okay, but that's not like a game show. But you just said no more

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,160
games. So why would you want it? Well, Family Feud. Family Feud is that game is the sport.

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, it's a way of life. Hey, how about this year? And it's also cursed if you're the host.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,520
It's a cursed hosting job. I want to talk for a second about the hosts of Family Feud. Oh,

39
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,040
good. Good, good, good. Now hang with me. Okay, because I if there's been a more diverse surfing

40
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:23,520
IMDB with your host Justin McElroy. I know. Hey kids, come with me on the magic IMDB bus. No, I

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,280
know this is all from the top of my head. Okay, Ray Combs, not funny, killed himself. Okay,

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,480
we don't want to. Thanks for establishing the non-funny that he killed himself or that he was

43
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:45,760
not funny. No, I mean, no, he is. It wasn't funny. Okay, so after Ray Combs died, the series went on

44
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,160
hiatus for a while. Now, Justin, is that funny or not? Or is that something tragic? That's still not

45
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
funny. Okay, here's the here's the the secession as the crowd has been passed. It has gone from

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,160
Louie Anderson, the third King Louie Anderson, the third King Louie Anderson, who begat to Richard

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Karn. Oh, man. Are you guys going to the fucking carnival this year? Yeah, I got my tickets. I had

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,920
to I had to I had to get them secondhand on eBay, but I think they're legitimate. They had the picture

49
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,680
of his face on the ticket. So I think I think I'm going to be able to sneak my way into this

50
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,520
this particular celebrity golf tournament. Jono Hurley. Perfect. You got anything with that? It's

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,840
Jay Peterman on Seinfeld. I mean, I know who the fucking guy is. You don't have to give me his

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,040
other credits. And then Steve Harvey and then Kevin Bacon. Six steps. Have you guys watched

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,680
that fucking show since Harvey's been the host of it? It is. It has gotten rippled. It's like,

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,000
what are your favorite Easter traditions? And then they'll turn to some like old grandma and

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,560
she'll be like, Percy. And then he'll be like, I don't know. And I'll turn the board. And plus,

56
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
it'd be like the top answer with 41 points. It's crazy how gross that show has gotten.

57
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:06,240
They that show has discovered more terms for a human genitals and be the other terms for sexual

58
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,560
activity. I'm going to have to call B.S. on this, Griffin, because according to a certain

59
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,640
entertainment database, he is a devout Christian. So I don't think that is. Well, that's what I'm

60
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,640
saying. It's it's like that. It's like the Patton Oswalt clean filth. It's like the grandma won't

61
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,560
say pussy. She'll say like, not a hoo ha. And he'll be like, I don't know. And it'll be the

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
top answer because people eat that shit up. Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

63
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,120
No, people eat up when there's an uncomfortable like over hyper sexualization of family feud.

64
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,640
That was those were always the episodes that people like talked about. And so Steve Harvey

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,920
hatched a sinister plan where he's like, let's get that shit in every episode or

66
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,600
start with episode. I would be more likely to watch family feud if the people they surveyed

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,800
what it was all like 12 to 14 year old middle school boys. And so it's just like a top answer

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,600
is farts. How do you show your family your love for 27 weeks running? Top answer is farts. Still,

69
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,320
let's actually help a real person. No one was here about me. I think we're providing a very

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,120
valuable service to Steve Harvey right now. Steve Harvey, clean up your act. Steve Harvey,

71
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,000
you have the 2497th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Get it together. You know, I was walking

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,360
into my apartment and I heard a girl exclaim shit. She had dropped some groceries. She was unloading

73
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,640
from her car and appeared to be having a hard time carrying everything into the next building over.

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,120
I thought about offering to help, but I didn't want to look like a creeper to follow her into

75
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
her apartment. But then I felt like a bad neighbor for not helping with a simple task.

76
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,800
Is it possible for a dude to offer a woman help without looking like he's hitting on her?

77
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,320
What should I do in this situation? I'm a man in his late 20s. She appeared a little younger

78
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,720
and was pretty cute. And our neighborhood is okay, but a little sketchy after dark.

79
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,800
You would have been fine. You would have been fine had it not been for that parenthetical.

80
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Yeah. You had to put it in there, didn't you? No, no, no. It's totally cool. I just want to help.

81
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I don't want to look like I'm hitting on her. I mean, she was pretty cute. No. Do you see why

82
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,400
they think this of us? Here's the problem. Do you see? Because it's easy. How to do it without

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,120
appearing like you're hitting on her. Don't hit on her. Yeah. But can you trust yourself? Can you

84
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,600
trust? Because it sounds like you have some tendencies. It sounds like you don't trust

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,600
yourself. You're going to be like, oh, don't worry. I got that. By the way, nice ass.

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,800
I don't think that. Sweet melons. What? I didn't buy melons. No. Talk about sweet melons.

87
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,440
It's a grocery joke. I got a lot of them. I also got a huge cucumber here.

88
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
I did actually buy a huge cucumber. Yeah. No, I have it. I have the cucumber.

89
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,280
I have it in my, I'm saying, do you want me to, do you want me to put it somewhere like

90
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:25,440
on my kitchen counter? I guess it's, I have like a hanging basket. And then it could get uncomfortable.

91
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,200
I have 10 wieners. Wait a minute. How do you? But only eight buns. Why do they do that? You ever

92
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,160
noticed? But I only bought a package of nine hot dogs at the store that sells things in packages

93
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,800
of nine. I think the thing you have to ask yourself is would you have felt the same inclination to help

94
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,680
had it been like a dude in a similar circumstance? Definitely not. Well, the thing is you wouldn't

95
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,400
have hesitated to help. I mean, I think that's, what's unfortunate is, you know,

96
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,760
if you don't want to look, I think the reason that you are worried that you're going to look

97
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,320
like you're hitting on this woman is that you were, I mean, you were. No, no, no. Here's the

98
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,640
thing though. I can see it from his point of view though, that where the fear would be

99
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,600
in that instant where you got to make that decision of like, do I say something or just

100
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,280
keep walking into my building? Like in this day and age, sometimes I, you know, I completely get

101
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,400
that like, no, if I say anything, it's gonna be a creeper. And then you get inside and go,

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,880
why didn't I just like say, oh, I'll help you with that. Like be a good dude. You know what I mean?

103
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,640
So like, I completely get the fear and I get the worry, even if there was no planned flirting,

104
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
or it was like, oh, hey, she's pretty cute. I'm going to go help her with her groceries.

105
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
When you size out a situation, when you size it up and you check out the scene

106
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,000
before making a decision and acting upon it, I don't, I don't, I think it's unrealistic for us

107
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,640
to say you shouldn't scope, scope out the other person's physicality for lack of a better word.

108
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
Mm-hmm.

109
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,000
I think, I think that's just human nature. I think you, I think you see,

110
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,640
I think you, I think it's coded into men's DNA that like you see a lady, you know, you know,

111
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,120
have two arms full and having trouble opening a door and you go to open that door and on the way

112
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,160
you fully scope it, like you fully scope it out and not in like a creepy way, man, I'm really

113
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
digging my trouble hole right now. It's like you're trying to overcome biology way.

114
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,120
Right.

115
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,960
Like you're assessing the situation.

116
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,280
He's got eyes is what I'm saying. He's got eyes and he sees the, he sees all the things and it's-

117
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,640
This is what, what you're pointing out is just that guys are the pits.

118
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
Guys are definitely the worst.

119
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,240
Everybody, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. It's not like he's a fucking scientist.

120
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
He can't objectively look at her face and body and be like, yes, I will help her. You know what

121
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,520
I mean? So he's, so even if he recognizes that she's cute, I don't think that should stop him-

122
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Why didn't he include it in his question?

123
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,920
Is, is, are we to believe that if she was less attractive, he would swoop in there and be her

124
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,800
valiant white knight? Cause he'd be like, don't, I'm not trying to get any play.

125
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,960
I think he included it in the question because he has an assumption that because she's cute,

126
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
she probably gets a lot more attention and expects that it's a hit.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,640
Or maybe because he's trying to have a cute meet.

128
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
This is the, like you have an opportunity. I think you had an opportunity.

129
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,080
Oh, you blew it and you'll never have it again forever.

130
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,240
You blew it and you'll never have it again, but you had an opportunity.

131
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,440
No, now when he sees her, he just has to say, hey, I saw you the other day with

132
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
the groceries and if you ever buy too many groceries again, just let me know and I'll help

133
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,760
you. Hey, I was going to help you with your groceries, but you were too pretty to help you.

134
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
If you buy too many oranges again, I'll help you.

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,640
Buy too many oranges next week and maybe I won't be scared this time.

136
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm going to be home about 5 30 if you don't buy too many oranges then.

137
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
Let me know next time you're planning on dropping a bunch of shit.

138
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,160
You had a great opportunity to go into the situation, help this woman and then leave.

139
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:05,440
And like reaffirm her fate, like start to rebuild this terrible debt of horribleness that we,

140
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
the male half of the species have built up over millennia.

141
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,360
Like you could start paying back that life debt that we have by just like

142
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
being nice and not hitting on somebody and just like helping them and then leaving.

143
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
Especially if you look at it from the other way that if like she saw you looking and you

144
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
didn't go over to help, she's like, God fucking dick.

145
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
He's already had too much shit.

146
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
Barbara, you have to leave this fucking city.

147
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
I am. I hate the city.

148
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,200
It's either dudes are hitting on you or they're not helping you with your too many oranges.

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
I bet that's how he gets off.

150
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
How he just holds it over your head that you can't hold six gallons of milk at one time.

151
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
Also, you need to stop drinking so much.

152
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,480
You can't walk anymore.

153
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
She would have been flabbergasted if he had swooped in and been like,

154
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, let me help you with that.

155
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then helped her with that and was like, all right, I'm taking off.

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Bye.

157
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

158
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
Was that Batman?

159
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,800
By just being a decent human being, you can like completely rewrite someone's day.

160
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,560
Maybe that was my grandson from the future come back to save my life.

161
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,680
That's the only rational explanation is that he's a time traveler.

162
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,080
Nope, there's nowhere else for that to go.

163
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

164
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
This Yahoo was sent in by Dale Roerbog.

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Thank you, Dale.

166
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ting Ting who asks,

167
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
and I'm sorry if this is too weird.

168
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Do you smell a person while hugging?

169
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Be true.

170
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
He adds, definitely yes.

171
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,280
It gives you a kind of an idea of what kind of a person he or she is.

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,880
Does it?

173
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm trying to think if I've ever like intentionally.

174
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Yeah, because that's the thing.

175
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,600
You mean like, oh, I hug someone and you know, like I'm breathing.

176
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,400
Yeah, that's the thing.

177
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
I hug someone and go.

178
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,120
It's like when you scope it out, when you scope out a situation and you see it with your eyes,

179
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
like the neurons are already in your brain.

180
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,280
Once you perceive the thing, the neurons are going to go where they want to go.

181
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,920
They're going to fire off the synapses that they want to fire off.

182
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
And then all of a sudden, you know, if that person's attractive or not.

183
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,720
When you hug someone, you have smell particles going in your nose that are firing off those.

184
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Your eyes can be deceived, Griffin.

185
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
Right, that's true.

186
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,760
But smell particles can't lie.

187
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I actually have, I think that my usual MO is to,

188
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,240
like I'll do a regular inhale, like as I'm going in for the hug, just breathing.

189
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh, man.

190
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,360
But then if I like, sort of, I like.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,760
Oh, you'll go in for secondsies.

192
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,320
I'll go.

193
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,200
You'll take a second.

194
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
Hey, do you mind if I take a second scoop?

195
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,080
Just real quick.

196
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
Let me just get a second scoop real quick.

197
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Is this one per customer or can I have two?

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640
Can I have, how much for an extra shot?

199
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,640
I feel like if you get an extra whiff in though, you definitely do have to comment.

200
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,320
Oh, man, definitely.

201
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,200
You just have to say like, okay, can I hug the other shoulder now?

202
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
And then you go to the right.

203
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
Yeah, like the French do it.

204
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
The French do it, double hugs.

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,680
This is a serious, serious problem for men of my sinucistic,

206
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,120
who have my particular almost constant set of maladies relating to my nose zone.

207
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,640
Which is to say, it's some kind of, it's either hay fever season or mold season

208
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,720
or some kind of season constantly here in Austin.

209
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,080
So I'm constantly sniffling.

210
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,160
And if I'm hugging someone, I mean, every 10 seconds I have to sniff.

211
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,400
And if they land in that period, it is going to seem like I'm like,

212
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,200
oh, hey, bring it in.

213
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Yeah, I haven't seen you in a while.

214
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,920
What?

215
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,760
No, it's just, yeah, I'm sick.

216
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, then why don't you just embrace it and be like, you smell great.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
Just say you smell great, everybody wants to hear that.

218
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,400
You brighten somebody's day, they don't think it's weird.

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Or you've been working out.

220
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,920
A compliment.

221
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,560
It's a great compliment when not said right after sniffing.

222
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,600
Because when somebody's fit, the scent that they produce is way,

223
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,960
way, way better when they've just-

224
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh no, I meant that they were working out immediately prior to the hug.

225
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Oh God.

226
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
So they smell like Jim Funk.

227
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,280
Also, have you guys met my friend, Jim Funk?

228
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
I want to ask you guys, this is related,

229
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
and it's something that's been on my mind for a few days.

230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
I was watching something on TV, I don't know.

231
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
But you see it all the time.

232
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
And two people were meeting-

233
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,400
The TV show?

234
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, a television program.

235
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
A few people were meeting, and when they were greeting each other,

236
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,480
the guy goes in and kisses the woman's cheek as like a greeting, right?

237
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,040
And you see this happen-

238
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,560
Was it his wife or his mom?

239
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,760
No.

240
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,240
Okay, well then-

241
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
But you see people doing, I mean, it happens.

242
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,440
People do it.

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
I don't know.

244
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
I mean, grownups are always doing this,

245
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,560
and I see it on television and sometimes in real life,

246
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:15,680
and I don't know how you would even begin to add that layer to your social repertoire.

247
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,920
Yeah, because I honestly, I've tried it.

248
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,040
Like, I've done a couple of, you know, just preliminary tries of the cheek kiss reading.

249
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,920
Just to kind of take it for a spin and see how it goes.

250
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,400
Hey, listen, I don't-

251
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
I gotta hear about your dry runs.

252
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,040
I don't want to weird you out, but do you want to experiment with me?

253
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,520
I want to try something out.

254
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
It's like, okay, so you know that awkward moment

255
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,840
when like someone goes for a hug and you go for a handshake?

256
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah.

257
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
It's like that times like eight, because it's like-

258
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,320
Just eight?

259
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
That seems so conservative.

260
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
Griffin, I've done a lot of number crunching on this.

261
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,800
It's eight.

262
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Because the person pulled back-

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
The chances that someone's gonna fucking headbutt you is pretty high.

264
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,080
The person pulled back and was like,

265
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
that was eight times weirder than when you go for a hug and they go for a handshake.

266
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,680
That was exactly 800% weirder.

267
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,760
Griffin, I took fucking statistics in college.

268
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
And I do, in fact, know what I'm talking about.

269
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
I've got a survey size of a thousand.

270
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,120
And it was based across the board.

271
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, you told us it was two.

272
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,080
What? No, I said a couple.

273
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,640
That could be a thousand.

274
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,120
How did you-

275
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Could have been a thousand.

276
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,320
How did you-

277
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,820
What-

278
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Were you-

279
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,360
Had you been drinking?

280
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,000
Like, what?

281
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,640
I don't know what-

282
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
Yeah, I can't even imagine making this decision.

283
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
No, that's a horrible experiment.

284
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,040
I did it in laboratory conditions.

285
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,560
Did you do one dude, one lady?

286
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
Just to see how it felt, like-

287
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I did 500 dudes and 500 dudes.

288
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
And it was mostly for college credit,

289
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
because I can't afford to pay that many people.

290
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,740
Sure.

291
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,340
Sure.

292
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,440
Your fucking mouth would have been busted after a thousand smooches.

293
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,320
I had a robot.

294
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
I didn't do it myself.

295
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,140
Right.

296
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,880
Pretend this robot is a loved one you haven't seen in a long time.

297
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Your acquaintances, but not lovers.

298
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
Okay, now the scene is set.

299
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,160
How many times worse was that?

300
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Enter the smooching chamber.

301
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
The background is set.

302
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
Enter the smoochitorium.

303
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,720
Well, you don't want to skew the results,

304
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
so I had to tell them they were there for a sleep study.

305
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,320
Something is going to happen in this room with this stranger robot

306
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
that's going to make you uncomfortable.

307
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,880
Have fun, science.

308
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
Get your college credit on the way out.

309
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,320
It's important that they don't know

310
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
that the robot is part of the experiment, though,

311
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,120
or else it'll ruin the truth of the experiment.

312
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,520
Which is?

313
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
If you ever see a robot, it better be a part of an experiment.

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Yeah.

315
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,360
I just can't.

316
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Honestly, I can't.

317
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,040
I cannot imagine.

318
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,840
I mean, adults seem to do it so smoothly.

319
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
Like, when it happens, it's like-

320
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,840
Okay, first, can I just say, you gotta stop saying adults.

321
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
It's grown-ups.

322
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Grown-ups are the only ones who do it.

323
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
Grown folks do it.

324
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,520
I see adults do it.

325
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
Like, grown-up people do it.

326
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know how they get-

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
I just- I don't-

328
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,400
Because the weirdest thing about it for me is that,

329
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,640
whenever it happens, the recipient never seems to be surprised.

330
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,000
So, in their mind, they had already met this person

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
in the social contract, like, halfway there.

332
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,200
Like, well, I'm expecting this person might kiss me on the cheek.

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
Have I- have there been people in my life that I have greeted

334
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,800
that were fully expecting a cheek kiss that did not receive one?

335
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
Just because it's not part of my repertoire.

336
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,000
No, I think it's like saying, I love you, where it's like,

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,760
until you do it the first time, it's never expected.

338
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,280
And then, once you do it, it's like, why didn't you say, I love you?

339
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
That probably has something to do with it.

340
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,560
And my theory, and I don't want to sound xenophobic,

341
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,400
which I do in, like, almost every episode anyway,

342
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,320
but I think that the friends that bring that element into your group of friends,

343
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,960
I think we can probably safely label that element,

344
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
that type of person, as people who have studied abroad.

345
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,320
I think that they bring that social norm back into your group of friends,

346
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,120
and then it sort of, it spreads like a virus throughout the culture.

347
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,000
Mm-hmm.

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,160
And then-

349
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,040
That would make sense.

350
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
It has to be sort of, like, in small do-

351
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,760
Like, this is not something that has stratified

352
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
throughout our entire cultural landscape in America.

353
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
There are pockets of it where it has spread.

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,360
I have been party to groups of friends throughout my travels

355
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,560
who, like, just don't physically touch each other at all.

356
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,040
Like, they don't hug or anything when we would get together and hang out.

357
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,560
And then, all of a sudden, one new person would be added to the group.

358
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,440
We'll call him Huggin' Dan, and Huggin' Dan would start hugging people.

359
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
And then, all of a sudden, the people in that group are like,

360
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,640
hey, hugs are pretty cool.

361
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,000
It's cool to hug a friend.

362
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,400
And then-

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
It's nice to connect with another human being.

364
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
With, like, a lot of your body all at the same time.

365
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
And then, all of a sudden, it's a hugging group of friends.

366
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
I think that's what happens with the cheek kiss,

367
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,320
except the person who does it is, like, way, way bolder than a Huggin' Dan.

368
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,920
They're a smooch and Steve.

369
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
If you want to become a smooch and Steve,

370
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
it's very important that you make eye contact first

371
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
and maybe put your hands on their shoulders

372
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
to, like, establish, like, this is happening.

373
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
And then, wait 30 seconds.

374
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,680
If they don't move, they're into it.

375
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,200
It's just, it's just-

376
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,560
You gotta wait till you feel an opening in their kinetic energy

377
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
and then you're invited in.

378
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
The fucking complications that it adds.

379
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,720
That's the thing.

380
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,040
Because, like, when we do, like,

381
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
when someone new is hanging out with our group,

382
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,520
our Huggin' group of friends,

383
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,480
I have that moment where, like, we hang out with them all day

384
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
and, like, I get to know them.

385
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm like, you are a tight bro and we are going to be bros for a long time.

386
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
I can just tell it in this connection.

387
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,040
But we've only known each other for one day.

388
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
Do I hug you when you leave?

389
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Here's how you do it.

390
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,880
Ah, this is how you figure-

391
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,560
This I've got an answer for.

392
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,040
You have to hug somebody else that you're already hugging friends with.

393
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,680
Yeah, and then he sees it.

394
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,840
And then look at this dude and you go,

395
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,720
fuck it, come here.

396
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,160
Okay, yes, that's true.

397
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,960
It's choppy waters, but they're navigable.

398
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
When kisses are up in the mix?

399
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,800
Then you gotta have one partner in crime that's like,

400
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
listen, I'm going to kiss your cheek

401
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
and then I'm going to fucking instigate it around

402
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
and people will see us do it and be like,

403
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,200
oh, that's not weird.

404
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,600
They did it.

405
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
I just don't understand where you're at in your life

406
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,440
when that risk-reward balances out.

407
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm so good at socializing that I'm going to challenge my game.

408
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm going to bump it up and make it harder for myself

409
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
because it's just too easy right now.

410
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,800
When you say risk, you mean the chance that maybe

411
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,120
they might choose that moment to go in for a cheek kiss

412
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,600
for you.

413
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,160
And then you kiss him.

414
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,200
Travis, when I say risk, I mean literally

415
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
any mouth-related catastrophe that has ever occurred

416
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
to anybody in your life.

417
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
How do I end up on their ear?

418
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
What do I do now?

419
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm nibbling.

420
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
I'm nibbling gently.

421
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
What am I doing?

422
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
My tongue's in their eye.

423
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
I had a stroke midway through

424
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,680
and now my mouth is on their nose forever.

425
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's also acknowledge the fact that, Travis,

426
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,960
in two months you're going to be a married man

427
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
and four I'll be a married man.

428
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Justin, you've been a married man for like 50 years.

429
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,760
We can't get into adultery like now.

430
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,600
We can't get into adultery because that is what that is.

431
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Your mouth touches another person's flesh.

432
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
That is sin in the eyes of the Lord.

433
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,200
I am not trying to fuck with that.

434
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
Guys, I'm a 20-year-old furry.

435
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,560
The squeaky clean charity doing kind.

436
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
Who's planning to buy a fursuit

437
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,360
to go to fur meets and charity events in.

438
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
Okay, Furries, I just want to interrupt real quick

439
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,400
and ask the question.

440
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,720
Is this a real thing where in the furry community

441
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
you just put fur before everything?

442
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Or is this gentleman just doing it?

443
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
Furries, I think we've made ourselves pretty clear

444
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
that we're supporters of your lifestyle

445
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
and your whole thing.

446
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
We're into it.

447
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,160
I don't think you need to clarify

448
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
that everything you do is fur related.

449
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Like if I'm going to-

450
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,280
And I might have some fur drinks at the fur bar.

451
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,160
Yeah, I don't go to like a tuxedo party.

452
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
I just go to like a ball.

453
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,240
I don't buy a clothesuit.

454
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,760
I just buy a suit.

455
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,720
Anyway, let's move on.

456
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,560
Fursuit, I think is actually a valuable qualifier.

457
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,160
I will grant you fursuit.

458
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay, that's important information.

459
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Anyway, I have wanted one since I joined the fandom

460
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
and I'm now able to purchase one

461
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,840
working 24 hours a week in 90 degree weather at Home Depot.

462
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,340
Jesus.

463
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,520
The suit will cost $2,300.

464
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,480
What the fuck?

465
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
This person's working a lot.

466
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,920
Give him a break.

467
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I know though, I guess great that you have $2,300

468
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,320
but that's a fucking moped.

469
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,680
That's like all kinds of that.

470
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,720
Why is a fursuit that expensive?

471
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,520
Because it's made by a world famous maker.

472
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,720
Oh, okay.

473
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,000
I should have let you finish the sentence.

474
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Go ahead and finish the sentence.

475
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,440
Thanks.

476
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,560
I'm a 20 year old furry.

477
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,880
The suit will cost $2,300 and is made by a world famous maker.

478
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,040
My parents, however, hate my plan.

479
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,920
They tell me wanting the suit is stupid and a waste of money.

480
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Please note that my brother who is a year younger than I am

481
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,920
is allowed to buy expensive cigars

482
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,160
even though my grandmother recently died from lung cancer

483
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,440
caused by secondhand smoke.

484
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
Should I really listen to my parents or ignore them

485
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,200
and achieve my long sought after prize fursuit funk?

486
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,920
Okay.

487
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm just gonna throw this out to you

488
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,600
that that's a missed opportunity in the name there

489
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
because it should be fursuit of happiness.

490
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,000
That's great.

491
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,080
So I have a lot of questions

492
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,040
and total understanding, total acceptance, no judgment.

493
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,080
We are open doors policy here at the Brother Institute.

494
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,680
I did not know.

495
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,360
And again, this is a learning journey I'm on

496
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,480
with the furry community.

497
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,800
I did not know that there was such a thing

498
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,600
as a world famous maker of furry suits.

499
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm imagining like a Donatella Versace only.

500
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,840
Or this designer.

501
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
I think you mean Donatella Fursace.

502
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Fuck me.

503
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm saying that I would resubscribe to any cable plan

504
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,240
that any cable company wanted me to be on

505
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,800
in order to watch Furry Project Runway.

506
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
Can I say yes to the fur dress?

507
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,200
Any show about furries at all I would watch in a heartbeat.

508
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm not talking about like true life.

509
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,880
I want to see one that celebrates a lifestyle.

510
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Yeah, I don't want it like gypsy wedding show.

511
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,040
I want it to be like, look how fucking awesome

512
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,560
and dope these people are.

513
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,600
Much more confident these people are in their life than you.

514
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,480
And what do you do?

515
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,880
That's so great.

516
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,840
What do you do?

517
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
You get nervous if your shorts don't match.

518
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
That guy's dressed like a badger.

519
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,400
Fuck you.

520
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,600
So here's my question.

521
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,560
And I think that this applies to a lot of different lifestyle

522
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,960
things like this.

523
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,560
I know what you're going to ask, Travis.

524
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,920
Is Deadmau5 a furry?

525
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,880
And I've wondered this myself for a really long time.

526
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,760
What have you come to him?

527
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
His head has robot parts in it.

528
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
So I think he's part of a different community.

529
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
I think he's part of-

530
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,840
You're saying he's a steam furry.

531
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,760
He's a sci-fury.

532
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,080
No, wait, that sounds like a scary thing.

533
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,280
My question is, do you need to swing for the fences

534
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,440
right out the gate with your first fursuit?

535
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,080
Oh, that's a good point.

536
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,640
Go for the designer 2300 one.

537
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
That is actually not a bad question, Travis.

538
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,360
I once told myself that I was going to get into the juicing

539
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,240
lifestyle that I was going to try like a juice fast.

540
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,560
And I made it to the afternoon and it didn't go great.

541
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,840
And I hated it.

542
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,680
But because I was making an investment in this lifestyle,

543
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,880
I had bought like a juicer that cost like $150.

544
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,320
And now it just sits in my basement.

545
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,280
If you want it, let me know.

546
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
Especially at 20, man.

547
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,160
Like you're working hard for this money.

548
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,840
And I know you want to spend it on this thing.

549
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
But you know, maybe around like 26,

550
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
you'll be a lot more financially stable.

551
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
And that's the time to invest in the really top of the line.

552
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,880
Plus, maybe you don't like your furry after a while.

553
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
Maybe you like want to try being a lion.

554
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,240
That's a good point.

555
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
I mean, is there some sort of, and again, no judgment,

556
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
learning, education.

557
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,560
Is there like a, is there like a tribalistic, like, oh, me?

558
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,760
Like a pack mentality?

559
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
No, not pack mentality.

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Like, do you have a fucking like spirit animal

561
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,600
in the furry community?

562
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,680
And then you're like, my shit is all about Arctic wolves.

563
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,640
Oh, are you saying like, I, you know, I'm a possum

564
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
and I've just always been a possum

565
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
and I've never realized it.

566
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
No, I'm not saying, I don't think it's kind of like dogs.

567
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
I don't think the identity like goes that deep

568
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
where it's like, I'm a dog.

569
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
I think it, I think that it's,

570
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,120
there's an acknowledgement of that.

571
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,800
They are a human and a dog suit.

572
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,480
I don't think that they actually think

573
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,080
they're a dog and a human body, but I'm saying like,

574
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,560
it's not something where you pick the animal.

575
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,280
It's like the animal has to be confusing at the fur meats.

576
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,320
Cause it'd be like, what happened to that fucking awesome

577
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,960
looking horse that, oh, no, he's a squid now.

578
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,160
Shit.

579
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,320
Yeah.

580
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
That would be, that would be confusing.

581
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,800
I, first off, please friend,

582
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,640
don't let your parents figure into this.

583
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
You're the one busting your ass.

584
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
It's your money.

585
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,280
And you're 20 years old.

586
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,880
Please just buy whatever you want.

587
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,080
We're just saying, if it's your first one, why not?

588
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,560
First.

589
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,160
First.

590
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,200
Why not spend a little less money?

591
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,520
Get something that's not, you know, quite as good.

592
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
And then we build to that.

593
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
Just take it for a test drive.

594
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,680
You know, if nothing else, just like give yourself a year

595
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
and be like, yeah, there's definitely one that I want.

596
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,360
But if, you know, I'm saying all this,

597
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,440
but I don't know if like, I don't know if that's offensive.

598
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
Like, I don't know if it's offensive,

599
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,080
the idea that you're just like, get a new fursuit when you want.

600
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,640
Like I'm wondering if it's like, there's more of a tie there.

601
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,280
You know what I mean?

602
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,560
Then I, then I know about, like it, it's, it's something

603
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,040
much more with more gravitas than just like,

604
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,320
a suit that you wear.

605
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,800
There's more of a connection that you can't just dispose of.

606
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,000
I think for me, it's just like,

607
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
even at this point in my life, I'm almost 30.

608
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,400
And like, if someone said, do you want to buy a car for $2,300?

609
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
I'd still be like, oh, I don't know.

610
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
That's a lot of money.

611
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,880
I'm just saying, it's just like a huge,

612
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,800
it's just a huge chunk to commit, especially, especially.

613
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,240
And I know that they shouldn't figure into it,

614
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,800
but like, if you've just hit the $2,300 mark

615
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,000
and buying this will drop you to zero, you know what I mean?

616
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,560
And what about, what if you pay $2,300

617
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,520
and then you put it on and just all you can hear

618
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,720
in your head is, it's itchy, I'm itchy and it's hot.

619
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,600
I hate this.

620
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,280
What if this person has been waiting

621
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,240
for like a year and a half, they made this appointment

622
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,520
a year and a half ago to see this world famous set.

623
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,320
What if this is like fucking Hattori Hanzo steal?

624
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,520
Like, what if this is like, this is his one shot.

625
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,880
This is their one shot to get this sweet ass

626
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,800
Hattori Hanzo suit, fursuit.

627
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,320
That's a Hattori Hanzo eel.

628
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,040
Do you know what I mean?

629
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,800
Like this, this may be once in a lifetime.

630
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,720
Justin just chopped a baseball in half.

631
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
That's ridiculous.

632
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,200
No, I know what you're saying.

633
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,160
I mean, it is definitely throwing your hat over the fence

634
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,360
as far as like-

635
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
And that hat costs $800

636
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
cause it's part of a $2,300 ensemble.

637
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,120
I think end of the day, like Justin said,

638
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,400
just don't let your parents figure into it.

639
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,960
Like it's your life and you're the one making this decision.

640
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
You're gonna be living with it, you're doing it.

641
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,120
Yeah.

642
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,000
So like, don't worry about what they say

643
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
because it's not their life and you're, you know, an adult.

644
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,800
Follow up question.

645
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm sorry to have so many questions.

646
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,280
I hope people know it's not coming from a place of judgment.

647
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,880
It's all about education and learning.

648
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
And that you're asking us.

649
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,480
And I'm asking you and you guys are both dummies.

650
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,200
But when I worked during the summers as WTCR,

651
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
our daddy's radio station,

652
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,400
their mascot cowabunga in which I would dress up as a cow suit,

653
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,680
I guess my overall question is, am I a furry?

654
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,840
No.

655
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
I did it too.

656
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,120
And I would be happy to, I mean,

657
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,000
if I had an end with the community like that,

658
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
like I was a furry before they were even called that.

659
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,980
Yeah.

660
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,200
I would be willing to bet.

661
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,720
I'm just gonna guess that there's a big difference

662
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,120
between being a person who puts on a suit

663
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,640
because you're getting paid to do it.

664
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,200
Yeah.

665
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,320
And being a part of a community that says,

666
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
this is my lifestyle.

667
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,880
In my defense, full disclosure, whenever I wore this suit,

668
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,680
I would walk around screaming, I am a cow.

669
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,400
Moo and shit.

670
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
Cow, cow, cow, cow, cow.

671
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,240
Also, in this person's defense,

672
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
that fucking suit didn't cost $2,300.

673
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,480
That suit maybe cost $52 at Magic Makers.

674
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,480
And imagine wearing that to a fucking fur meat.

675
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,680
Like, hey guys, can I play?

676
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,920
I'm wearing a jumpsuit made of felt

677
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,000
and my head is made of shitty paper mache.

678
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm one of you.

679
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,080
Like, you're wicked not.

680
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,920
This suit cost me 10 Gs.

681
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,120
Cost me 10 stacks.

682
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
It's got working gills.

683
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,280
This is an actual suit I can swim in in the ocean forever.

684
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,480
It's got gills in it and shit.

685
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,360
The best part about the cowabunga suit

686
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,760
is there was an upgrade made at some point

687
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,880
where it also included an ice vest

688
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
to try to keep yourself cool and comfortable

689
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,680
inside the suit.

690
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,840
So the experience was really, it was unparalleled.

691
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,760
You would have frozen nipples.

692
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,480
Yeah.

693
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,240
And sweaty everything.

694
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,720
Daddy, why is a cow not moving?

695
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,600
Oh, his heart stopped.

696
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
His body temperature was reduced

697
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,320
to a point where his heart stopped.

698
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,520
It's actually very interesting, son.

699
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,200
Let me tell you about the science behind it.

700
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,360
There was also two forms of cowabunga,

701
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,560
the skinny form and then the fat form

702
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
that included like this foam kind of fill out

703
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,800
shaped like a bell.

704
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,920
Did you do a t-trap?

705
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,560
Yeah.

706
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,120
All right, you did a t-trap.

707
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,480
I was also in the key coyote and the B-97.

708
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,200
Fuck, your fur credentials are like on point.

709
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,920
Listen, I'm no Johnny Fur lately.

710
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,480
You know what I mean?

711
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
I do know what you mean.

712
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,640
We're all furries.

713
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,160
And if we're going to buy a new suit,

714
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,120
we've got to get paid.

715
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Let's go to the money bag.

716
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Ugh, it happened again.

717
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,600
Are you going to tell us like what?

718
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,880
Or?

719
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,840
It's my balls.

720
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,760
You know, I turned my back on them for 30 seconds

721
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,040
and they just start wandering.

722
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,760
Hold up.

723
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,120
How the fuck did you physically turn your back on your balls?

724
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,640
I turned my back on my balls

725
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
and they just start wandering.

726
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
More pressing question.

727
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,520
Do you dedicate every hour of the day,

728
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
save for 30 seconds to just staring intently at your balls

729
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,280
and making sure they don't get up in the-

730
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
Don't go anywhere.

731
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
I have to as the only option.

732
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,480
It's the only option I have

733
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
because as soon as I turn my back on them,

734
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,800
they just start wandering all over my body.

735
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,120
Isn't there a service you could pay or something

736
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,080
to like do that for you

737
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,280
so you could like get some sleep

738
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
or like enjoy a meal?

739
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
Got to be a better way.

740
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,440
Well, good news.

741
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,440
I know I'm the one with the problem.

742
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,600
There's a wizard that lives in the forest

743
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,880
that can cast a spell

744
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
that can charm your balls to sleep.

745
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm giving you a brief resume.

746
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,440
And this is a service that you can sign up for

747
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
at extremerestraints.com.

748
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,120
It is not.

749
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,360
Betterextremerestraints.com, you could buy a cage

750
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,760
for your penis that keeps it exactly where you want.

751
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
The circle around the balls.

752
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,840
I don't want to split hairs,

753
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,200
but you did say balls.

754
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,680
Is this-

755
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
Listen, if you don't want to split hairs,

756
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,480
you should stay away from a cage

757
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,520
that goes around your penis.

758
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
It's got a little lock on it.

759
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,760
It's the CB6000S chastity device.

760
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, the 6000S is out?

761
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,800
Yeah, it's finally out of Japan.

762
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,280
It's finally here in America.

763
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,960
It comes in a lot of different sizes.

764
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,960
Listen, just be honest with yourself

765
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
when you buy it, okay?

766
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,760
There's no metal for getting the biggest one.

767
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,440
And it's got a hinge for added comfort,

768
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,000
which seems-

769
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Counterintuitive a bit, maybe?

770
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,280
Counterintuitive, yeah.

771
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
They made a little prison for your dick,

772
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
but it's got a very nice window in it

773
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
so your dick can see outside.

774
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,120
There's a little pillow and a private bathroom.

775
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,160
It's nice.

776
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
It's just one of like thousands,

777
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,720
maybe millions of sex toys at ExtremeRestraints.com.

778
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,040
Adult entertainment devices.

779
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
They have a little bit of everything,

780
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,840
no matter what the fetish or whatever thing

781
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,920
that makes you sex better, they've got it.

782
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,520
You know what I love?

783
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
If Extreme Restraints just threw

784
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
like a couple of products on there

785
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,680
that just like that there was no sexual application for,

786
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,120
just so as people were browsing through,

787
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,400
they're like doing it, doing it,

788
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,520
and they get like a skip it.

789
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
And they're like, okay.

790
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,560
I could find a fucking way.

791
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,840
I could find a way to fuck with that.

792
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,560
I've always wanted to challenge my dexterity.

793
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,400

of the WTCR cow mascot.

with my dick prison?

813
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,920
Yep.

814
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,880
Uh, yeah.

815
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,380
Cool.

816
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,080
My pee pee looks like the girl from that 70s show,

817
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,720
so that's perfect.

818
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
My name is Graham Clark.

819
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
My name is Dave Shumka.

820
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,840
I'm the other guy who hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

821
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,720
And I'm the other guy that hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

822
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,760
We are from Canada, so we don't know many of your ways,

823
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,040
but what we do know is quality podcasting.

824
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
And whale blubber.

825
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,560
Yeah.

826
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,520
There's 50 different words for podcast in our language.

827
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
We would say all 50 of them,

828
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,960
but why don't you just listen to our show

829
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,360
and you'll get the gist of what we're about.

830
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
We bring a guest on.

831
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,760
We talk about their lives.

832
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
We talk about our lives.

833
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
We talk about things they've overheard.

834
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
It's a great time.

835
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,480
And you know what?

836
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
You're not going to regret it.

837
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
Stop Podcasting Yourself,

838
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,480
available from MaximumFun.org or on iTunes.

839
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,280
Brr.

840
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
That's what we say in Canada when we're cold.

841
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,120
Farm wisdom.

842
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,720
Farm wisdom.

843
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
Get your cow into a soup.

844
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,720
Farm wisdom.

845
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
Oh, what if you put your cow in a person's suit?

846
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,200
Oh yeah, I'm a humie.

847
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm a skin.

848
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm a flesh-o.

849
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,400
What would they be called?

850
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,440
Humies?

851
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,640
Humies, maybe, I guess.

852
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,280
I'm a humie.

853
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Cows are proven to have...

854
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
Oh no, you know what, Travis?

855
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,480
You should read farm wisdom.

856
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,360
That's your thing, I think.

857
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,160
Okay.

858
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,720
Cows are proven to have best friends.

859
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,400
If they are separated from each other,

860
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,680
they get stressed and their milk yields suffer.

861
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,640
That's from Victoria.

862
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,840
Yeah, I don't know why,

863
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,000
but I find that fucking heartwarming.

864
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,560
Oh, it's amazing.

865
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,440
I actually watched,

866
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,200
there's this documentary on Netflix about,

867
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
I think it's called Animal Odd Couples.

868
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,880
And it's about this dog and this cheetah are best pals.

869
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,320
And so to interview zookeepers, they're like,

870
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,360
yeah, I don't know what fucking happened.

871
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
This dog and cheetah just started hanging out together.

872
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,800
But you knew that they just put them in a cage,

873
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,760
like, let's see what'll happen.

874
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,520
You know, they went through like 14 dogs and six cheetahs

875
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,800
before they found the right mix.

876
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,080
Griffin, I cannot imagine how bad of a day you have to have

877
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,880
before you decide that you deserve Animal Odd Couples.

878
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
We watched a very bleak marathon of Homeland.

879
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,800
And I was like, we gotta fucking boost these spirits.

880
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,160
Let's watch a monkey on a dog.

881
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,840
Trav, any other farm wisdom this week?

882
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,600
Yeah, I want Griffin to read the second one.

883
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,280
This is one sent in by Laura, thank you.

884
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,240
She says, if you want to get rid of a ground horse,

885
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,480
get rid of a ground hog, pee in its hole.

886
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,080
It will move to a better neighborhood.

887
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
All the property values around here have just plummeted

888
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,640
ever since Jeff peed in our burrow.

889
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,440
I feel like a bad elements moved in

890
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,680
ever since Jeff peed in here.

891
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
Hey, Jeff, what are you doing?

892
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,560
Hey, neighbor.

893
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,520
Hey, neighbor, I'm just gardening.

894
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,080
Yeah, I just put in my last mortgage payment today.

895
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,200
We own the, oh, fuck.

896
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, Jeff.

897
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,520
Just repainted the kid's room.

898
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,880
We pretty well have, oh, damn it, Jeff.

899
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,200
At least the smell's gonna go, oh, you ate asparagus.

900
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,320
Oh, fucking Jeff.

901
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,240
You know, earlier today, I was telling Jeff

902
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,600
about our ground hog problem.

903
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,120
Oh, God damn it.

904
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,560
God damn it, Julia.

905
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,800
I told you not to tell Jeff about our ground hogs.

906
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh, he's outside already.

907
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,920
Son of a bitch.

908
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,320
I kind of feel like that's a catch all way

909
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,480
to get anything to move out of the neighborhood.

910
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,080
Like, is there an animal that like,

911
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,920
you pee in its burrow and it's like, nice.

912
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
Nice, sweet.

913
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,400
Probably prairie dogs.

914
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,360
Fucking nasty ass rodents.

915
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
Let's get some piss up in here.

916
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,120
Yeah, now the party's really getting started.

917
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,240
We're all freaks.

918
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,320
You know rattlesnakes are getting dirty.

919
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,880
We love it.

920
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,640
You guys wanna Yahoo?

921
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:29,860
Please.

922
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Bobby Mitchell.

923
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,840
Thank you, Bobby.

924
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,560
That's why Yahoo answers user demonica who asks.

925
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,440
Do these guys want to steal my horse?

926
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,560
It's very complicated, but I'm going to try

927
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,760
my best of what's happening.

928
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,560
I got a healthy, sorry, I already fucked up.

929
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,240
I got an healthy race horse.

930
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,400
He's four and beautiful and calm as anything.

931
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,520
He's a dream horse.

932
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,360
So anyway, there's a group of lads.

933
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,440
They keep on pointing my horse out in the field

934
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,320
or in the stable.

935
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
They asked me if he was mine today.

936
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,880
I was on a hack out with him,

937
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,720
and the guys keep their eyes on him.

938
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,400
And when they noticed I was watching them,

939
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,440
they turned the other way.

940
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,840
So when I came back to the stables,

941
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,240
they were outside my stable door and said,

942
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,760
oh, he's beautiful, isn't he?

943
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,320
But there's something suspicious about their behavior, right?

944
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,360
They also want to stop beating it.

945
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,600
I also noticed, gross, I also noticed

946
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,800
when I'm riding in the arena,

947
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,600
they watch him in the far distance outside the gate.

948
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,120
So any idea of why they seem more attached to my horse?

949
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,320
Are they flirting?

950
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,160
Other people are also interested in him,

951
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
but they don't do what they do.

952
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,080
So I'm finding their actions very suspicious.

953
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,640
What should I do?

954
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,520
She means, are they flirting with her?

955
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,040
It's hard to tell.

956
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,440
By lads, she may actually mean four other horses.

957
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,080
Like horses are following her horse around.

958
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,520
Gonna steal this horse.

959
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,800
It'll be like horse taken.

960
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
You know, I think that any,

961
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,480
I think she might be projecting a little bit.

962
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,360
She just loves that horse so much

963
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,640
that she assumes everyone else

964
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
would want to get into this dream horse.

965
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,800
Get into it?

966
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,520
Like get, you know, like get.

967
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
They just want to take a, you know,

968
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,520
they want to get inside, like sit in the passenger seat.

969
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,320
Right, right, right.

970
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,920
Get into its whole scenario.

971
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,760
They think, hey, like, like you could, you know,

972
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
really get into it.

973
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,080
Like that scene in Ace Ventura when nature calls

974
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,480
and he's inside the rhino.

975
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,200
God, if we could go one episode.

976
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,720
No, I don't mean like literally into.

977
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,120
I mean, like, like when you go to the car dealership,

978
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,920
it's like, I can get you into a new sedan.

979
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,080
What's it gonna take to put you inside this horse?

980
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,760
You know, I don't think a horse can have a side car, Justin,

981
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,560
if that's what you're, if that's what you're suggesting.

982
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,360
Does AC come standard on this horse?

983
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,200
Is this a standard or automatic horse?

984
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,320
I see.

985
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,800
Can you even steal a horse?

986
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,240
Like, if you can, the worst thing you can do

987
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,400
is sit there and go, that's a beautiful horse.

988
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,600
No, you know what?

989
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,400
What kind of oats?

990
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
Does he eat any kind of special oats?

991
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
How would I steal him, just hypothetically?

992
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,640
The problem with the idea of stealing a horse

993
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,600
is because it implies that you can own a horse

994
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,800
and as we all know.

995
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,520
Not possible.

996
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,880
Nobody can own a horse.

997
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,440
They are like freedom incarnate.

998
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,920
You can steal a dream.

999
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
Can you steal a hope?

1000
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
Can you steal wishes?

1001
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,040
At best, you can form a partnership,

1002
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,360
a voluntary partnership with a horse.

1003
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,400
At best.

1004
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,840
There is no title involved in the process.

1005
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,320
And if anything, it's a tenuous agreement.

1006
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,000
Can you steal a sunset?

1007
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,380
Can you?

1008
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,520
Travis.

1009
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
I imagine it's also-

1010
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,080
Answer the question, Travis.

1011
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,960
Oh, sorry.

1012
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,560
Answer my question about sunsets.

1013
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,580
Yes.

1014
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,120
In Oceans 14.

1015
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,560
Why is it so dark?

1016
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,240
It's like fucking-

1017
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,360
We're stealing the sun.

1018
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,080
You fucking lost it, Danny Ocean.

1019
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,520
We're gonna get killed.

1020
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,280
We're gonna get killed by the mafia

1021
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,480
unless we bring them the sun.

1022
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,440
We just need to build the ladder big enough.

1023
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,760
Okay, you smell like poop

1024
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,080
and you haven't cut your hair in six years.

1025
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,800
Bum bum.

1026
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,040
We gotta get the Asian guy to jump up to the sun.

1027
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,200
Brad Pitt's character won't stop eating human flesh.

1028
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,880
We gotta hold him up and hide him in a rocket.

1029
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,360
Hide him in the rocket that NASA sends up there

1030
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
and then he'll jump to the sun.

1031
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,480
So Brad Pitt, did you get 14 people to help with this mission?

1032
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,720
No, everybody thinks it's kind of dumb.

1033
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,480
It's kind of a bad mission, I think.

1034
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,320
Because they don't see how we make any money off of it,

1035
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,800
which I think is short-sighted, but I do see their point.

1036
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,480
The only guy we got was Scott Conn.

1037
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
He's not doing anything.

1038
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,360
I told him lunch would be provided and he was in.

1039
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,880
His identical brother Casey Affleck was busy.

1040
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,960
I don't think you can steal.

1041
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,520
I think the horse won't be cool with it.

1042
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,080
That's the thing.

1043
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,600
I imagine it's hard to steal something

1044
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,560
that actively wants to return from whence it came.

1045
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,640
Because what good is that?

1046
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,400
You got a horse that you could never put out in the field

1047
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,720
or it's just gonna be like, peace, come back to where the apples are.

1048
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,480
You have to indoctrinate that.

1049
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
You have to, right, you have to brainwash the horse.

1050
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,120
It's got to be very much like Homeland.

1051
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,760
You know what I mean?

1052
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,600
I'm not saying beat the horse until it loves you,

1053
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,200
even though that is basically the only interaction

1054
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,760
that us stupid humans understand with those horses.

1055
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,520
I don't think that horses have the sort of homeward bound instinct

1056
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,160
that you guys want them to have.

1057
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,360
I don't think that if you get a horse in Colorado,

1058
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,880
horses are gonna be like, well, it's back to Ohio for me.

1059
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,960
If a horse is gonna run back to Ohio,

1060
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
you better help their own apples in between those two.

1061
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,360
As the crow flies, they had better not pass any apples

1062
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,680
because that horse will stop and live there.

1063
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,800
If you're gonna steal the horse,

1064
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,280
you have to form a partnership with it.

1065
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,560
I am going to try and do this

1066
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,400
because I don't have the money to do this.

1067
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,320
You got to throw down some negs first, right?

1068
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,080
You got to insult the horse a little bit.

1069
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,320
And that's how you get the horse interested in you.

1070
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,080
So you say like, oh, I don't think you run very fast.

1071
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,400
Your mane isn't glorious and beautiful,

1072
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,560
like the most beautiful head of human hair.

1073
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,760
And then you give them some oats.

1074
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,200
Griffin, you're just cribbing stuff

1075
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,800
that you learned from the Giddy Up artist.

1076
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,520
Imagine like a little jockey with this big stupid hat.

1077
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Do you know that show was filmed in Austin?

1078
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,560
Those fucking douchers left like an irreparable scar on this city.

1079
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm surprised that anybody can pick up anybody for any reason.

1080
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,720
Ever.

1081
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,440
Ever.

1082
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,480
Hey brothers, I just started a new minimum wage job

1083
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,120
and my mom won't stop asking how it went.

1084
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,000
I like my job, but nothing really happens at the bakery.

1085
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,800
How do I include her in my life without boring her?

1086
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,720
That's from vague and vacant.

1087
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,320
When she asks you to say, you know, making dough,

1088
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
and you do that enough and she'll stop asking.

1089
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,760
Oh man, it's been in my, like speaking from experience,

1090
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,240
I can say that when questions ask about boring shit,

1091
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,640
then our answers are usually pretty exciting.

1092
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,240
I mean, you can make stuff up.

1093
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,040
You can lie.

1094
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,800
How was your day?

1095
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,560
It was fucking wild, mom.

1096
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, let me, you're not going to believe it.

1097
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,040
Pat Sajak came in, that's burned the place to the ground.

1098
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,000
That's your, that's just lost, lost his shit.

1099
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,880
That's your big day?

1100
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,360
Took three people to wrestle him to the ground.

1101
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,040
He was foaming at the mouth.

1102
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
He was riding a stolen horse.

1103
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,240
He jumped through a plate glass window.

1104
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,360
I thought I would hear about that.

1105
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,040
And he just, he just, he just, he just,

1106
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,720
kept screaming, popper nickel.

1107
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,800
Why wouldn't I hear about this in the news?

1108
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,720
It's a big government coverup.

1109
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,040
Apparently he had escaped from a government testing facility

1110
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,480
where they were testing cheek kissing.

1111
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,520
And he just fucking lost it.

1112
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,920
Now I don't think that this is, I think you're.

1113
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
Mom, mom, try this free sourdough I brought you.

1114
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,280
Let me, is this laces?

1115
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,320
Oh, oh.

1116
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,040
Sorry mom, you knew too much.

1117
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:36,480
This is funny, I like this podcast.

1118
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Oh man, this is the great thing about having three guys on it

1119
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,920
is like every once in a while, one of us can just sort of,

1120
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,880
it's usually me.

1121
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,040
Yeah.

1122
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,840
If you need to rotate out, you just go back to the back of the line.

1123
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,160
It's like, I say something funny and you guys just,

1124
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,440
we need a schedule, we've been putting it off for a long time.

1125
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,080
Some of the color coded in our weekly calendars.

1126
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,480
I feel like at the beginning we needed all three of us

1127
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,600
to be working constantly,

1128
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,240
but I feel like we're getting closer to peak efficiency

1129
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,920
or peak not giving a shit.

1130
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,040
So we may want to just revisit that whole schedule thing.

1131
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,640
I love it.

1132
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,720
Read the next question.

1133
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,600
Sounds like it'll be good.

1134
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,800
Regularly, I'll be having a conversation with someone

1135
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,760
and they'll drop the combo of excessively complimenting me

1136
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,360
and criticizing themselves.

1137
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,760
I'm never sure how to respond in this situation.

1138
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,280
I've tried complimenting them back,

1139
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,120
telling them not to be so hard on themselves

1140
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,840
or ignoring their criticism and just accepting the compliment,

1141
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
but it all feels hollow and weird.

1142
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,680
There are three people in my life who do this all the time.

1143
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,760
One of whom is my boss slash advisor,

1144
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,880
who I work closely with.

1145
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,600
What should I do when this comes up?

1146
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,080
That's from so hard on yourself.

1147
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,280
I would also say that if you have three people

1148
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,120
and it sounds like you're only required

1149
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,800
to actually spend time with one of them,

1150
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,880
then you have an opportunity to drop at least two of them

1151
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,000
from the roster.

1152
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,760
And the way you do that is you have them talk to each other

1153
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,200
and they form a recursive compliment criticizing cycle

1154
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,200
that they talk to each other until they both die of old age.

1155
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,920
And then you only have but one to deal with.

1156
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,400
Mm-hmm. And then you only have but one to deal with.

1157
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,880
You could also easily cut them out by when they're like,

1158
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,960
no, you're pretty and I'm ugly.

1159
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,320
You go, yep. Yep.

1160
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,200
Check out my style.

1161
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,680
That's not your opinion, that's fact.

1162
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,200
And you're kind of a dumpo.

1163
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,960
You're kind of a dumper.

1164
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,400
This is tough because you don't,

1165
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,360
I mean, on the one hand, you don't want to give,

1166
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,960
you don't want to reinforce this behavior

1167
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,320
by giving the person what they seek,

1168
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,440
which is a bunch of compliments.

1169
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,160
Hmm. What's the second half of that?

1170
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,240
That's it. I mean, you don't, that's it.

1171
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,480
I mean, what's the alternative is you have to sit there

1172
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,800
and tell them that, yeah, uh-huh.

1173
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,160
Yeah, you got it about right.

1174
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,320
Because psychologically, the other problem is,

1175
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,680
is that if you do it,

1176
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,920
not only are you reinforcing behavior,

1177
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,240
but it also drives home for them that the only reason

1178
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,480
they're getting complimented is because of this.

1179
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,120
And it actually hurts their self-esteem in the long run

1180
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,880
because it's like, they wouldn't have complimented me

1181
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,640
if I hadn't asked them to.

1182
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,760
I think you're- And you know what I mean?

1183
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,840
And it becomes a bigger problem.

1184
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,640
Your only response is, I think,

1185
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,440
a broad, sweeping generalization

1186
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,480
about just the futility of everything.

1187
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,840
So they're like, I'm just, I'm so ugly and you're so pretty

1188
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,040
and I wish I could look like you.

1189
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,440
Like, well, I mean, my looks are gonna fade,

1190
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,720
looks always fade until we are returned unto the loam.

1191
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,680
But in the long run, I mean, we're all just dust anyways, right?

1192
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,000
Think about it. We're all just a big cosmic joke.

1193
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
Matter's default state is chaos.

1194
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:48,960
Think about it.

1195
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
Our lives are just a fucking blink of an eye

1196
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,880
in the grand scheme of things.

1197
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,120
My good looks have also pretty much ensured

1198
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,840
that nobody's ever going to help me pick up my groceries.

1199
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,840
So. So my life is pretty much shit too.

1200
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,880
Maybe think about that a little bit before you start whining.

1201
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,920
Maybe ask them more questions

1202
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,280
about why they feel the way they feel.

1203
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,360
Just kind of get, try to get to the root of it, you know?

1204
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,040
Oh, why do you feel that way?

1205
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,320
Why do you think that?

1206
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,920
Like a psychoanalyzation.

1207
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,920
But it could be like,

1208
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,640
why do you feel that way about your own looks?

1209
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,280
And they could be like, elephantitis, dude.

1210
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,240
Like, look at me.

1211
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,880
Fucking come on.

1212
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,240
Because of that acid incident, you dick.

1213
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,800
Also, you're Charlize Theron.

1214
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,360
So like, that's why I made that comparison.

1215
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,960
So like, that seems pretty obvious.

1216
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,040
Ooh, what about this?

1217
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,480
Is this helpful advice?

1218
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,920
Just fact check me here.

1219
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,160
Okay.

1220
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,360
Just start complimenting them before the cycle starts.

1221
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,080
Whoa.

1222
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,760
So when you see them, be like,

1223
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,160
hey, is that a new haircut, a new shirt?

1224
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,360
You look great today.

1225
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,600
And they'll be like, but they'll find the thing.

1226
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,520
They'll be like, yeah, but I'm real dumb.

1227
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,920
And then they'll be like, well, fuck.

1228
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
Well, then if that happens, if that happens,

1229
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,960
you're completely justified.

1230
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm like, Susan, just gave you a compliment.

1231
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,560
Don't do that.

1232
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,000
That's the perfect thing.

1233
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,800
Susan.

1234
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,960
Don't fucking undercut me on this.

1235
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,800
Don't fucking undercut me on this.

1236
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,440
I said your new shirt looked nice.

1237
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,680
You started talking about your butt or something,

1238
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,880
and I hate it.

1239
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,840
Susan.

1240
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,040
Classic Susan.

1241
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,160
This is like, pure Susan.

1242
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,400
This is unfiltered, fresh from a mountain spring, Susan.

1243
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,760
Maybe you go even deeper with Susan.

1244
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,800
Instead of Inception complimenting her,

1245
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,440
when you go in for a hug and a cheek kiss,

1246
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,760
when you're in there, you lean into her ear,

1247
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,880
and you say, don't even fucking start, Susan.

1248
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,520
Susan, don't even get fucking started.

1249
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,400
And then you pull back.

1250
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,320
Susan, this may seem like the day,

1251
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,600
this is not the day for your shit.

1252
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,080
Susan.

1253
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,520
This is my house now, Susan.

1254
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,640
Susan, we're all-

1255
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,080
The dynamic done changed.

1256
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,200
We're all working real hard, Susan,

1257
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,760
to put up with Susan.

1258
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,920
Why don't you give us one day's respite from your shit?

1259
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
Susan, look around you.

1260
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,440
You are standing on a razor.

1261
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,320
This is the edge of a razor,

1262
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,920
and you are on it.

1263
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,360
Also, just real quick wanted to tell you

1264
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,920
that you smell delicious.

1265
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,520
As long as-

1266
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,680
You have on Dr. Pepper lip gloss.

1267
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,640
What is that?

1268
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,680
It is enchanting.

1269
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,640
Susan, you smell enchanting, and today is not the day-

1270
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,840
Today is-

1271
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,440
But don't get me wrong,

1272
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,520
enchanting lip smell or not,

1273
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,320
I'll fucking end you.

1274
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
Now, Susan, I don't want you to get freaked out,

1275
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,440
but I'm gonna try something.

1276
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,240
Was that good?

1277
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,240
And then meanwhile, your coworkers are going,

1278
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,200
she's been talking to her boss for like 20 minutes

1279
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,160
in her ear.

1280
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,960
I don't know what's going on.

1281
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,160
I think she wants a raise.

1282
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,600
Did she just kiss her on the cheek?

1283
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,640
Let's get that started.

1284
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,560
Let's all do it.

1285
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,920
Best friend club.

1286
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,400
Craig, come here.

1287
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,200
I want to try something.

1288
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,040
I just saw Jenny do it to Susan.

1289
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,520
It's great.

1290
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,240
Come here.

1291
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:06,720
Come here.

1292
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,480
Come here.

1293
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:08,960
Hey, Craig.

1294
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,280
Dope fucking stuff.

1295
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,040
Craig, I wish I could just live on your shoulder.

1296
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,320
You smell so much better than Susan.

1297
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,280
Don't tell Susan.

1298
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,000
Smell Susan.

1299
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,200
I'm right here.

1300
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,400
Susan.

1301
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:22,800
Come here.

1302
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,240
Bring your head closer to Craig's head.

1303
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,560
I'm gonna conference you in.

1304
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,680
Smell Craig real quick.

1305
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,400
Now smell yourself.

1306
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,320
Craig smells like cronuts.

1307
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:32,880
I love it.

1308
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,760
Do we eat cronuts today, Craig?

1309
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,520
I think I love Craig.

1310
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,800
Guys, I have an announcement.

1311
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,680
I think I love Craig.

1312
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,600
This just in.

1313
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,440
Griffin loves Craig.

1314
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,480
And you know who we love?

1315
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,000
We love you for listening to our advice show,

1316
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,040

We hope you've had a good time here today.

We, um, if you want to shoot us questions,

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,040
I don't think we've given out our email address in a long time.

1327
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,760
It's MBMBAM at Maximumfun.org.

00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,840
Um, you can send us questions.

1329
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,800
You can send us Yahoo's.

1330
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,600
Thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's this week.

1331
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,880
Um, also check out the other shows on Maximumfun.org.

1332
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,600
There's a ton of great super free comedy podcasts,

1333
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,200
like Throwing Shade, Jordan and Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

1334
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,120
Wham Bam Pow, One Bad Mother, Bullseye, Judge John Hodgman,

1335
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,440
and Risk, The Memory Palace.

1336
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,600
And Sawboners.

1337
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,320
Sawboners.

1338
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,400
Is that show still on?

1339
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:00,800
Got them.

1340
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,080
It's not what it's called.

1341
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,360
I think it's called Sawboners.

1342
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,240
It's called Sawbones.

1343
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,360
It's a medical history show.

1344
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,280
I do it with my wife and it's great.

1345
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,480
And it's better than this dumb show.

1346
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
At least you'll fucking learn something.

1347
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,120
Listen, by the way, Justin,

1348
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,360
I feel like you've been stealing a lot of our market share.

1349
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,560
Yeah, we need to talk.

1350
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,680
We'll talk about that off the air.

1351
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:21,680
But, um, uh, if you want to have a spot on our, uh, on our money zone,

1352
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,720
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1353
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,160
You can get a personal message.

1354
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,640
You can, uh, get a message for your business or website,

1355
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,320
or if you work for an organization or are yourself a one person organization,

1356
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,800
then you can have a super professional one,

1357
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,520
just like we do for, uh, Extreme Restraints everywhere.

1358
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:41,680
Yeah.

1359
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,240
If you want to do a personal message where you talk about how much you love

1360
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,440
Extreme Restraints line of products, that would actually be great for us.

1361
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,840
Just in like a time saving level.

1362
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,040
Think of us is what we're saying.

1363
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,240
Just think of us when you, when you give us money to talk about you.

1364
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,000
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1365
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,720
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1366
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,080
Got a lot of complaints during the, um, the early years compilation.

1367
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,400
They're like, where's that John Roderick and the Long Winters song.

1368
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,440
And I said, I'm sorry, I don't know what Justin was doing.

1369
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,280
I was just trying to get retro for one episode.

1370
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,240
Just one episode.

1371
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,120
It's old school.

1372
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,520
Yeah.

1373
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,480
Why are you so eager to move away from the past or from what?

1374
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,760
Why are you so afraid of what the future?

1375
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,880
Cause I sounded like a fucking nerd bird back then.

1376
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,760
And I don't know why.

1377
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,960
He had a lot of growing up to do to beat yourself up.

1378
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,840
I guess that's true.

1379
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,880
You want one final Yahoo?
