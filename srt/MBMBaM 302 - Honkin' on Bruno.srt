1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, brought to you by Captain America

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,280
Civil War in theaters now. I'm your middle-est brother, Ant-Man. I'm your... I almost said

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,880
middle-est brother, but that would be a lie. I'm the sweet baby brother. That's a fucking lie.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,120
That is my branding. I mean, uh-oh, we got a civil war of our own, brother against brother.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,040
I want to be the middle-est brother. I want to switch ages with Travis, and I think I found a

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
witch on the internet that can do that for me. We could do it through cryogenic freezing,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,240
much like, spoiler alert, the winter soldier Bucky Barnes. Captain America Civil War pits

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,720
Captain America. Is this an official watch? Is this an official Civil War watch? This is an official

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
Captain America Civil War watch. All right, you know what that means. Let me scoop up all my

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,800
DVD copies of Kung Fu Panda 3 and throw them right into the burnerator. We should also say

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,600
that nothing we're about to say should be taken as fact. I don't want anyone yelling at me about

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,200
spoilers because none of this is true. Now, let me give a straight recap of the plot,

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
and then we'll get into some jokes about it. Okay. Okay. Just to get set the ground rules. Okay. So,

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,040
Iron Man loves slaves. Uh-huh. And he wants nothing more than to keep his massive army of

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
slaves. Exactly. Plus, that's how he made all of his money off of his plantations. And who do you

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,240
think builds all of his many, many robotic armor suits for him? It's not him, and it's not Pepper

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Potts. Yeah, it's not Pepper Potts. It's Iron Man, and he's a slaver, and he loves slaves.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Captain America is like, not on my watch, girlfriend, and they get into a big scrap about it.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
Some of the superheroes love slaves. Yeah, a lot of them like really, really, really. Well,

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,880
some of them, yeah, some of them do. Not all. The ones you would expect, right? Slave man,

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,640
definitely. Definitely. Okay. Dr. Racist, he definitely loves slaves. Yeah. But there are

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,080
some surprises in there, too. The gentrifier. Yeah. She loves slavery. Cheap labor woman.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:52,480
The overseer. The overseer. And, of course, Ant-Man, which is like, what? So weird. What?

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
What? Well, you have to know that Ant stands for antebellum.

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,960
We're off to the races. So that's the film. Captain America, Civil War Watch. I guess the

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,600
question on everybody's mind is, Travis, how many times have you seen it? 16, Justin. Now,

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,480
is this just back-to-back feelings? No, they were just one chunk at a time. I had to take breaks

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,680
because it was too intense. The racism was a little, it kind of like filled up the theater

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,120
with a weird energy. It was like a Trump rally in there. It was really off-putting. Especially

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,640
when the racists win. Yeah. And I don't want to spoil anything, but racism is not only,

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
it's like codified by the end of it. They put it in the Constitution. Yeah. And I don't think that

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
they should do that. And Iron Man wrote it. And he was wearing the Iron Man suit when he wrote it

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
by pen. So it's almost illegible. Which I think constitutional scholars are going to be arguing,

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,480
is that a comma? Or is it a apostrophe? Or is it a J? That's how bad Iron Man, when in his suit,

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,280
his penmanship is. Just think about it. Just think about it. You're not seeing a lot of documents in

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
there. I think the weirdest part is at the end when Bruce Banner is walking away sadly and he

42
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,440
looks at the camera and says, who knew that the Hulk's one weakness was racism? Yeah. It's really

43
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,320
weak, but powerful. Yeah. All right, boys, let's see. We got to talk about it. Whose team are you

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,400
on? Iron Man or Captain America? Which one was the racist team? Yeah. The one that's not racist,

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
I guess. Right? Definitely. I'm going to say the non-racist team. I mean, I do love Ant-Man.

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,840
Yeah. I mean, I love Ant-Man. Yeah. That's the problem is Paul Rudd puts on a great character

47
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,440
portrayal of Ant, the Ant-Man. But the problem is- Okay, let me gauge your guys' opinion. Is Paul

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Rudd America's most lovable racist? I don't want to espouse that sort of sentence. He's playing

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
a role. He's playing a role. I mean, it's not him. Oh, damn. No, I mean, as his portrayal,

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,240
does he make Ant-Man America's most lovable racist? You know what I heard? He was on set.

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,480
He was actually kind of difficult to work with, which I can't even imagine because it is him.

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,680
But I think I've heard in the magazines that he was on some Jared Leto shit, just being kind of

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,000
racially charged. He also insisted that everyone be bigger than him. Which is so weird.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,920
That's how they did that. Do you know that they did that effect? Yeah. And it's very wasteful.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Yeah. But when he shrinks, they just made everything around him very big. Yeah, like in

56
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,400
The Hobbit. Yeah, except times a billion because it's like, make a gun the size of a building,

57
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
make an Anthony Mackie the size of a town. And it's all practical. And it's all practical.

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:46,000
If you go to Muncie, there's a giant statue of Anthony Mackie. And it's like,

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
well, we just didn't have anything else to do. Where are we going to put him? Yeah,

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
that's just where they left the biomech suit that they put regular sized Anthony Mackie in.

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,040
All right, this next segment's for all the comic book nerds out there. Who's your favorite

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,000
comic book hero cameo in this one? Because mine was Red Boy who teamed up with Iron Man,

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
which was a little bit disappointing. But I loved, I was surprised to see Red Boy in there.

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:17,120
He had such a limited run in Image Comics comics. I liked the cat guy. Which one? The cat guy.

65
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,400
Kitty Cat Man. Kitty Cat Man. Yeah. Kitty Cat Man jumped around really good. He jumped around

66
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,640
fast and strong. And at one point he jumped and I was like, ooh, good kitty. And it was pretty cool.

67
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,400
I liked the great emancipate Thor, which was Thor in an Abraham Lincoln costume,

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,280
as if we wouldn't notice. Oh, I thought that that was Abraham Lincoln had picked up Thor's hammer.

69
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,480
No. Oh, I misread that. Okay, let me say this. If you and our presidents are able and worthy

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,440
to read the power of Moulnier, it would definitely be an Abraham Lincoln. Did you just say Moulnier

71
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
like it was French? Moulnier. Moulnier. Like it was a French philosopher? How do you pronounce it?

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,520
What do you say, Trav? Mjolnir the hammer. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir. Mjolnir.

73
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Mjolnir. That's just a little joke I like to make to teach people about nir and far. Mjolnir.

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,440
Mjolnir. I guess the side I'm on is Captain America Civil War II. How about at Hollywood,

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm ready. I'm not getting out of my chair until it shows up on the screen.

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,240
I want Captain America Civil War II to just be like, I'm mad at you again. Well, I'm mad at you

77
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,040
again. I'm still mad at you from the first time. I'm red boy. Just kidding, red boy dies in the

78
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,760
first one. Kitty cat man eats him and then spits him back up. Kitty cat man eats him whole. Let's

79
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,120
um, God, we can't go an episode without a voice. Spits out a voice. Yeah. Can we do some advice?

80
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Yes. But go see Captain America Civil War. Support indie projects. Support indie comics.

81
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,680
Local. Happy free comic book movie day. Go see it. It's free.

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,600
Hey brothers, I want to give you all- I went to free comic book day, by the way. And before

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,720
I lay waste to the free comic book day, I spent like $150 at my comic book shop. So

84
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm supporting the whole industry, I guess. Um, I had never done free comic book day and I rolled

85
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
up and I was like, free comics, here they come. And they're like, here's an Archie little sampler.

86
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,800
It's three pages long. It's like, I can't finish to this. You know what I mean? That's horse samples.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,040
I got that same Archie and it's the entire first episode and it's a bolded direction for the

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,720
franchise. Well, damn, you put me on blast. Yeah. Maybe if you're going to make a joke,

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,760
it should be about something that's real. I guess I just prefer graphic novels,

90
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
you know, something with a little bit more meat and heft to it. A little bit more seriousness,

91
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
less play play. You know what I like is saga. You guys read saga? Fuck yeah, saga.

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,240
Good book. Did you buy any saga? No, I bought that new Hawkeye. Let's move on though. Hell yeah.

93
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
My spouse and I will be attending a rather unconventional wedding and weekend retreat.

94
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,040
The bride and groom are total hippies. And according to the invitation, we can expect

95
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,320
such activities as clothing, optional pool parties and all nights unspecified quote ritual.

96
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,840
Justin, you added a fucking Yogi Bear extra syllable to the word activities.

97
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,200
And I'm going to. Activities?

98
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
Activities.

99
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm here to participate in the activities. Excuse me.

100
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm Antebellum Man.

101
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,880
Where can I put my cane? I'm Antebellum Man. I'm here for the activities.

102
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
I would like a MoMA Mojito.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh, you know, the famous southern drink, the MoMA Mojito.

104
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
Mojito MoMo. All right, go on.

105
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
I got Tommy Hilfiger trunks. All right.

106
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,560
But my real quandary is what to wear. The requested attire for the ceremony is,

107
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
quote, elegant.

108
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,800
That is not a thing. That's not. That's some my fair wedding with David to Tara

109
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
Candace chic bullshit. That's not anything.

110
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,280
I need some. It's their wedding, Griffin. I need some in style of Vice Brothers.

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,960
Can I get some specific suggestions for elegant, kooky men's and women's clothing that will be

112
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,080
wedding appropriate? That's from Wacky Wedding Wardrobe Woes in Washington.

113
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,240
And let's not kid around. That place is going to be a Zoot Suit riot.

114
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,120
I mean, 100% right?

115
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
It's going to be amazing.

116
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I want, okay, I also just want to like jump right out there and say,

117
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
I don't have a problem with you saying I want my wedding.

118
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,280
I want people to wear like eccentric kooky attire.

119
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,040
But when you say a term like elegant kooky, that's just not a fit.

120
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
Like that's just not a classification.

121
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,240
It's going to be a fucking Paula Poundstone cosplay convention up in this shit.

122
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah. You might as well just say like, I want it to be wacky formal.

123
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Like what is that? Does that mean I show up in a tuxedo t-shirt?

124
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
Does that mean I wear my suit backwards?

125
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
Does that mean that it's like black tie and also silk tunic?

126
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,040
This is why I put them-

127
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't know.

128
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
It's your wedding day, chase your bliss, do whatever.

129
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,200
But this is one thing where your bliss can't be chased.

130
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,520
You need to let your bliss run away and then you chase your pragmatism.

131
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Because this isn't a direction that you were giving literally every person that's coming

132
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,320
to your wedding and elegant kooky doesn't mean a fucking thing.

133
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,080
It doesn't fucking mean anything.

134
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,480
It carries no connotation whatsoever.

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
I would definitely, like to me, I would definitely want to wear

136
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
basically everything F. Murray Abraham Warren Amadeus.

137
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
This would be my one chance.

138
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh, this is fun.

139
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,520
Where would you go with it?

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,440
To definitely get, I would go frock.

141
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,800
I would have like the whole look, the powdered wig, that whole fun thing.

142
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,920
Maybe like birds in there, birds in my wig, that kind of thing.

143
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Oh yeah.

144
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
I love that style.

145
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,000
I think I would go tear away tuxedo and then I would be wearing,

146
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
inspired by the flop house, a tux speedo underneath.

147
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
That's fun.

148
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,760
Oh, nice.

149
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,080
I would go full, I mean, you guys know, I already said I would totally pound my stone,

150
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,600
but I would also have like a little bit of the mask, like the Cuban Pete scene in there.

151
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
By which I mean, I would be wearing a latex, the mask mask.

152
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh yeah.

153
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,160
From the mask.

154
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
Nothing says elegant kooky like the mask.

155
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
But also again, big suit, big suit, big tie, big, loud tie,

156
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,440
big, loud colors, big, loud pinstripe suit.

157
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,720
I would wear-

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
But cut out.

159
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,120
But cut out suspenders.

160
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,480
I would wear a very regular normal tux, except when you get like super close,

161
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
you can see it's all fruit by the foot.

162
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh, that's pretty kooky.

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
And if you want, and I'm like, and when people get close enough,

164
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
I just like whispering in the air, like, want a nibble?

165
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:41,920
Like that.

166
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,800
Want a nibble?

167
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
Now you're getting into spooky kooky.

168
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:44,960
Yeah.

169
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,360
Nibble.

170
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,480
That's good.

171
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,840
I mean, that's kooky is all good.

172
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
What about like a body paint suit?

173
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay.

174
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
I feel like that's elegant kooky.

175
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Like I'm trying to think what you got to get the kooky and you got to get the elegant.

176
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
That's like, that's like that.

177
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay.

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
That's a great look if you're beautiful and cut.

179
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
And I'm assuming a lot of people at this wedding will be.

180
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Yeah, absolutely.

181
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,240
Definitely.

182
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,840
If I show up in a body painted tuxedo, people are just going to be shouting like,

183
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,200
that man is made of eels.

184
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah.

185
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Somebody, somebody stop him.

186
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,840
Help that man.

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,680
Can we, can I just go in a regular suit that I have poured a bunch of soup all over?

188
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,560
You mean a soup suit.

189
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm talking about my soup suit riot.

190
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,720
Riot.

191
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,600
Don't buy the bottle of chunky.

192
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,840
It'll be a multiple soup situation.

193
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,360
I can do chili in my pocket.

194
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
And then like when I, when somebody is like,

195
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
does anybody have anything they want to say to stop this wedding?

196
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,280
Which is what they say.

197
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,360
Then you, you slap your pocket and like chili comes splatting out all over the place.

198
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,520
And people are like, Griffin, you got us again.

199
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,480
I like that Griffin, because you're not just a guest, you're the caterer.

200
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Yes.

201
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,280
You're going to wear a suit, a soup stain suit.

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,160
You better hope that everybody's aim with the bird seed at the end is, is very great.

203
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah.

204
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,040
Like very good.

205
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,640
If they're throwing rice and it just sticks to you,

206
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960
you're going to turn into a one man golden grail for birds.

207
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,680
When I was in, when I was in college and I needed money,

208
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,440
I would go to high end parties and I would be naked.

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,200
And I would just like lie down on a big table naked and people would eat,

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
not sushi off of my nude body, but just different soups.

211
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,000
There's different soups and you're from your crevices, you mean?

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,520
Well, no, it was just kind of caked on.

213
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
They had to like really scrape it.

214
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,840
It was old soup.

215
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
It was a real dry soup.

216
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
Like a real dry, old, dry, old, dry soup.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,960
Like powdered soup.

218
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,200
And they would have to scrape it off into,

219
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I would actually just hold it in my hands for them.

220
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,000
The fresh hot soup I would hold in my hands and just sort of lift up to their mouth.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,120
Here you go, sir.

222
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Please enjoy.

223
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
Maybe just wear a regular ass tuxedo.

224
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
And then when people say like, what's the kooky element?

225
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,160
Look them down the eye and just like, don't you get it?

226
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,400
And then put it back on them.

227
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,360
Make them cook it up.

228
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,640
Or just like a Marvin the Martian tie.

229
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,600
Can you wear a tuxedo top, cargo shorts bottom?

230
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Oh, that's fun.

231
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,320
Ooh, I like that.

232
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
That's very like 80s, early 90s.

233
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,520
When I was in-

234
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,880
You would see that character in like a college comedy.

235
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,320
I used to do formal top, shorts, bottom.

236
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
I discovered that look in middle school a lot.

237
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,880
And I wore it a lot.

238
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
And I'm looking back at it now.

239
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
Let me close my eyes and like really get a picture of my mind's eye

240
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
because I'm pretty sure.

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
Oh, yep.

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
I did look like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park.

243
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,640
Are you talking about a look that I know myself,

244
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,840
I sort of like endeavored into was like a long sleeve plaid with jorts.

245
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,880
Was like one that I know that I definitely had at some point.

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
And felt, and the weird thing was because it had buttons on it.

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
I felt like pretty good about it.

248
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,840
Yeah, like, yeah.

249
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm making a go at this thing called fashion today.

250
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
I was not above in high school.

251
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,880
I remember at least once probably multiple times wore a dress shirt,

252
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,840
like a button up dress shirt and tear away pants,

253
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,160
like tear away workout pants.

254
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,160
And I was like, yeah, because I was like in show choir and theater and stuff.

255
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
So it was cool you guys until even like the show choir kids were like,

256
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,960
came you, you need to not, you need to get that shit together.

257
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,400
I wore tear away pants to gym class just to make it easier on the bullies.

258
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
Wait, the bullies were just tearing your pants off?

259
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,240
But that's it.

260
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,080
Just shred my pants off like pants hyenas.

261
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,880
But that's it.

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,400
Like you made it too easy on them and they didn't want to do it anymore.

263
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
Ah, this isn't even fun anymore.

264
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
It's like he likes it.

265
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,600
Yeah, I did just wear sweatpants and a t-shirt to school forever

266
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
when I was in gym because I couldn't change in the locker room.

267
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
So I just wore gym clothes.

268
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,120
God.

269
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
All right, let's do a Yahoo.

270
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, please get me out of this fucking pit.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah, we're all really deep in this pit,

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
but that's okay because we've been here before.

273
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Elegant kooky.

274
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,520
This one was sent in by Rachel Roseng, game recognized game.

275
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,160
Thank you, Rachel.

276
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh, they're anonymous.

278
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,400
In the sports martial arts category, they ask,

279
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,280
oh, let's give them a name.

280
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Uh, Purchase, Purchase, not Precious asks, I want to learn MMA,

281
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
but I am worried about safety.

282
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,720
I know it's a stupid concern as fighting is not a safe thing to do,

283
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,400
but I really want to be able to defend myself without losing all my brain function.

284
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
How do MMA classes normally deal with average working people

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,040
who don't go down the professional route as like a hobby?

286
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
I want to learn MMA.

287
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,400
Is this the getting hit part?

288
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,720
I could do without that part.

289
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,680
That's actually, this is actually not a terrible question

290
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,000
because like, how do you do, how do you do like amateur MMA

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
in such a way that you make it clear?

292
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,000
Like, I know I could do it better with harder hitting,

293
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,720
but I just, that's not where I'm.

294
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Well, this is predicated on the existence of another person

295
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,880
who doesn't want to do the punching part of it and only wants to be hit.

296
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,880
But is this person concerned about the death toll of MMA classes?

297
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,560
Like, we lost another one.

298
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,520
Like, I would have to think this is a concern that has been dealt with before now.

299
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
Like a teacher going, wait, no one wants to get hit, huh?

300
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,600
Oh, damn it.

301
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,480
I want to go out on a limb and bet that number eight, zero though.

302
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Like, I'm going to go out, yeah, it ain't nothing.

303
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,480
When you go to the part where you're training regular, okay,

304
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,680
and learn all the moves, and then when it's time to spar with a partner,

305
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
get this, you throw a paper mache version of yourself in the ring.

306
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,120
Interesting, that's some ninjitsu shit.

307
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah, like.

308
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,840
I wouldn't watch that training montage.

309
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
Yeah, and they're already like attacking it

310
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
and punching it and like they punch you in your solar plexus

311
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
and they're like, that's a death blow.

312
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,920
Their hand goes clean through you and then they come out

313
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,280
and what do they have in their hand?

314
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
A zag nut, you're full of candy, that's right.

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
You've self pinataed and that is the safest thing you can do.

316
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,800
Because you're just going to think about punching

317
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
when they got a delicious zag nut to enjoy.

318
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,000
What I love about that is that I think that movies like Karate Kid

319
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,640
have taught us that the fastest way to win is not to fight, right?

320
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
Absolutely, see why skip ahead.

321
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Right, so maybe that's what every MMA teacher is waiting for,

322
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,200
to have one student who's like, no, you know what?

323
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,680
No, and then everybody just raises them up on their shoulder,

324
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,760
gives them like three black belts,

325
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,680
and like just dances them around the place

326
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,960
because like they're the only people who have figured out MMA.

327
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
They're just waiting for like Chuck Liddell to be like,

328
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
you know what, I don't want to punch anymore.

329
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,520
And everyone's like, you're the hero now.

330
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
You've taught us a valuable lesson.

331
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,640
MMA is canceled, everybody.

332
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,560
No more MMA.

333
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,200
You know what I would do?

334
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
They solved it, why are we even doing this?

335
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,760
I would do like in the Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Donnie Jr.

336
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,560
And I would do that thing where like I see them like-

337
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,400
Do you mean the only good Sherlock Holmes?

338
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,480
I see the man who I'm fighting start to twist back and he's shirtless.

339
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
Should I slow down?

340
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
And he's shirtless and he's twisting backwards,

341
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,800
like give me a good old haymaker.

342
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
And I'm looking at his muscles inside his body

343
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,400
and he's moving in slow motion.

344
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
And like this like user interface sort of appears over him.

345
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,800
And it's like weak left ribs,

346
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
punch impact coming in two seconds,

347
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,000
blind spot in right eye.

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,320
And I'm like fucking analyzing all of his data

349
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
and his weak points and shit and like checking out his HP.

350
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,920
And then like once I've fully scanned him like that,

351
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,400
I can dodge all his blows and punch him where it would hurt his body the most.

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
It just occurred to me that like Sherlock Holmes,

353
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,160
Robert Donnie Sherlock Holmes basically just has Jarvis again.

354
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,640
He loved having a computer in his head so much.

355
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
He's like, let's do it again, guys.

356
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,920
Hey guys, listen to me.

357
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,800
RDJ, listen, I was thinking could you have a robot in my head again?

358
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,200
Wouldn't it be great if that scene played out with him analyzing

359
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
although this is while he was getting punched.

360
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,240
Yeah, that would probably be more.

361
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,120
As the guy's punching him, he's like weak left eye.

362
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Poof, limp on the left leg.

363
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,120
Travis, I was just in the pupil state of a note perfect Robert Donnie Jr.

364
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, you really crunched it.

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,200
History will never forgive you for not letting that blossom

366
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,720
emerge from its chrysalis into the world's most perfect Robert Donnie Jr. impression.

367
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Do you wanna, is it too late to take a second stab?

368
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,560
It's gone, baby, it's gone.

369
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
I should clarify, I also liked the young Sherlock Holmes

370
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
where there was like the fear toxin

371
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,880
and there was a part where like the buns came to life

372
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,200
and like all the sweets were attacking.

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:47,520
I don't think I have the fighting prowess required to slow motion scan my enemies.

374
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,040
But could I make them think that I was to scare them away from me?

375
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
Like that would be my self-defense.

376
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,160
Like if I see somebody coming for me with a big old barrel of punches

377
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,520
that they're about to upend on me, then I can look at them and be like,

378
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:11,280
scanning left eye Lopez, right ribs, former broke left wrist in 1996.

379
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,920
Weak left wrist, legs are soft, soft legs.

380
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,960
Maybe just like undiagnosed appendicitis, one punch could kill.

381
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,440
Oh yeah.

382
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm out.

383
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
That would be good, loose brain.

384
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,480
Or what if you went psychological, Griffin, and analyzed them psychologically

385
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,800
and you're just like friends and family never loved them

386
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,160
and you just like were instead like throwing out kind of more psychological barbs.

387
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
Dad is a time traveler, doesn't, isn't home very much.

388
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
That's right, my dad is a time traveler.

389
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
At least that's what he tells me when he goes for business trips.

390
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,560
How about another question?

391
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,920
What if you just decided to like, you know about cosplaying,

392
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,280
what if you like cos-fighted, what if you said like, listen, Iron Man,

393
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,400
like you got in the ring, got his head, like, hey, listen, Iron Man,

394
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,680
I'm not gonna fight you, I'm your best friend Captain America, we can't do this.

395
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

396
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I think that'd be hugely distracting.

397
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
That would be, it's me, red boy.

398
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Well, fuck, I can't punch red boy.

399
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm not gonna punch red boy, we're fast friends.

400
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
On my way to work, I stop at a coffee shop.

401
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
There is a barista there who, whether he is working or just hanging out on his off hours,

402
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
stares at me like he wants to murder me and wear my skin every single day.

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
It's majorly creepy and unsettling and not a great start to my day.

404
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,240
What do I do?

405
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,120
Do I ignore it?

406
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Do I go to a different coffee place that's not as convenient?

407
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,600
Do I tell a manager, even though I'd feel bad if it got him fired?

408
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
Creepers need jobs too?

409
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
And that's from Coffee Conundrum.

410
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,800
There's a sandwich shop very close to me that has some boys in it

411
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,760
that made me feel uncomfortable, not in like a danger place,

412
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,880
but just like they don't respect this sort of social cues

413
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
that me or anybody else in line at this place puts out.

414
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,160
And so we have just stopped going to that sandwich place,

415
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,360
going to a different sandwich place.

416
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
Can you give me a little more, a little more color?

417
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,880
Like, what are you saying?

418
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah, that could be anywhere from like-

419
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,240
All right, all right, all right, all right.

420
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Like, giggling at you.

421
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,360
Yeah, okay, let's just role play.

422
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,960
Justin, you're mean.

423
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
And I really want you to sort of take your own sort of social needs

424
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,040
and desires into, hey man, how's your weekend?

425
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,760
Wait, so I'm you?

426
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,080
Yes.

427
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,280
Okay.

428
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,600
I'd like a pepperoni sandwich, please.

429
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Oh, cool, man.

430
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,680
I'll whip that up for you.

431
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,920
And then I'm gonna sing like a little song while I do it,

432
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,800
like literally sing a song, like literally sing a song.

433
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,280
And I'm gonna look up at you and be like, so how was your weekend?

434
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,560
How's the sandwich coming?

435
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
It was fine, it was fine.

436
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,160
So this isn't gonna work, is it, this role play session?

437
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,080
Let me try, let me try.

438
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
Let's recast it, okay.

439
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
I'm just, I liked Justin better

440
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
because I know that his like social stuff's not as good as yours.

441
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,200
I got you.

442
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,700
Okay.

443
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
Hey man, how was your weekend?

444
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,160
Pokemon!

445
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,200
All right, fuck you guys.

446
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
It sounds like they have a joyful heart,

447
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,920
like they're approaching the world in their work with a joyful heart

448
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,760
and that's what's making you so uncomfortable.

449
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,400
No, it's not, it's bad, it's bad.

450
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,360
Cause I like that shit.

451
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,440
I'm usually into like having a conversation.

452
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
I love having a conversation with a person.

453
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
It's just different, there's a funk to it.

454
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
There's a funk to it.

455
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,640
It's like a judgment funk, like you're gonna say the wrong thing.

456
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,440
A bit of a judge.

457
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,360
I've gotten that at a coffee shop before

458
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,720
where the dude or lady or person was very cool.

459
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
Just very, yeah.

460
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
And I knew like, I knew that if I was just like,

461
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
I would just like, there's, especially here in Los Angeles

462
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,360
where like I just want a cup of like drip coffee

463
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,880
and then they like artisanally like pour hot water

464
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,040
over a single cup brew into a glass pitcher

465
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,000
and the whole time they're just like staring at me as they do it

466
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,280
as though I'm supposed to be impressed

467
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,440
that they can pour water over coffee

468
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
and then they hand me the coffee and I'm like, okay, cool.

469
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
And that's $6, great, thank you so much.

470
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,800
In one transaction with these two boys,

471
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
one of them quoted Monty Python at me twice.

472
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,800
That's where we're at.

473
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880
That's rough.

474
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
That shouldn't be weaponized.

475
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,800
It's been aerosolized and it was sprayed in my fucking face

476
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,000
and into my nose and mouth and in my breath system.

477
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,320
Okay, I feel like if you wanna keep talking to this,

478
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
going to this store, you have to talk to this person.

479
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,160
If you wanna keep dating this Starbucks.

480
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,240
If you wanna keep in this committed relationship

481
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
with your local Starbucks,

482
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
you need to talk to this person

483
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,680
and ask them what their fucking story is.

484
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,120
That would shut it down, right?

485
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,840
Like, I mean, the problem is it is impossible for us

486
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,720
to calculate whether or not some sort of like flirtation

487
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
or sexual attraction is like figuring into this.

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
Like, is this someone who's very bad at,

489
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,360
like who has read the game one too many times

490
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,760
and thinks that like consistent eye contact

491
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,320
is hugely important.

492
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,440
Is that a Grisham novel?

493
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,640
Yeah, it's a movie where, I think it's Michael Douglas.

494
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
He like is in a big game.

496
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,920
Where they just nag on each other.

497
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,400
They just nag each other back and forth and back and forth

498
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
and at the end he gets thrown off a building.

499
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,080
I think the key to making that work, Justin,

500
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,120
because I think you're right.

501
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,720
I think you have to find a window of like,

502
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,520
so they're doing something that you can count,

503
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,840
not like maybe they're reading a paper

504
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,560
or like it's something that you can comment on

505
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,640
rather than just walking up to them and going,

506
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,040
hello, I'm Steven or you know what I mean?

507
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Like you need some,

508
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,440
because if they respond like, yeah, go fuck yourself,

509
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640
then you're like, oh, cool.

510
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
I get exactly what's going on now.

511
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,480
But if they do read the situation

512
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,280
is whatever interaction you try to have with them,

513
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,480
you are flirting with them.

514
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,000
And as far as they're concerned, it's on,

515
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
you do need to pull out

516
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,720
and go to a different coffee shop from now on.

517
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,560
That coffee shop is-

518
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
I'd say fuck that.

519
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,600
Don't even give them a fucking chance.

520
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,760
It is a consumer facing business

521
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,560
and you're uncomfortable with the treatment

522
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,640
of the consumers and that's all that matters.

523
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,800
Baby buck stops here, customer's always right.

524
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,200
Consumer's always right.

525
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Just fucking-

526
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,860
So do you complain, Griffin?

527
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,700
No, you fucking bounce.

528
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,280
You go somewhere else and give them their dollars

529
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
and maybe somebody will,

530
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,120
just all I need is just a coffee and a banana

531
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,240
and a have a nice day.

532
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,840
That's all I need, coffee, check.

533
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Banana, check.

534
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,520
Go fuck yourself, not a check.

535
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm gonna go somewhere else.

536
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
I actually wouldn't mind

537
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,200
if I was buying coffee and a banana

538
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
and then I handed them the money and they said,

539
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
okay, thanks, go fuck yourself.

540
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,960
I actually would be okay with that as an interaction.

541
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,680
Okay, so sort of Dick's last cafe.

542
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
Yeah, I would know exactly where I stood

543
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,600
with that coffee shop.

544
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
Excuse me, fellas.

545
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,080
I needed to take a quick sidebar

546
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,520
to talk about the pickup artist.

547
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh, Jesus.

548
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,200
I think the greatest injustice in human history

549
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,360
is that we were not producing the show

550
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,800
at the same time in synchronicity

551
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,520
with a hit series called The Pickup Artist.

552
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,840
We would have known that it was about

553
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,080
to like ruin fucking everything, right?

554
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,000
Just the worst thing.

555
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Then on this show, if you missed it,

556
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,040
started a guy literally named Mystery

557
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,240
who wore a hat that he definitely wore.

558
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
And if you can look up a picture of Mystery's hat,

559
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,840
you'll very much appreciate what a commitment that is

560
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,920
to his whole stage.

561
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,840
Mystery spelled in the traditional spelling of the name

562
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,800
or like Mr. E.

563
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
No, it's just Mystery.

564
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,280
And his real name is Eric Von Markovic.

565
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
Oh, right.

566
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah.

567
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,440
All right.

568
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
Just super quick.

569
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,000
There were, it looks like eight contestants

570
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,600
in the first season of The Pickup Artist

571
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
where he tried to teach these fellas how to score bibs.

572
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,040
And I'm just gonna read you their status.

573
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,360
They were fighting for bibs?

574
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,200
Like that you put bibs?

575
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,280
They get prodigious bibs.

576
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,240
Super quick.

577
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm gonna tell you the stat.

578
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm not gonna tell you their names

579
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,160
because who gives a shit.

580
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
I wanna tell you the reasons that they're on the show.

581
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,920
Eight quick reasons.

582
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
Here we go.

583
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,200
Number one, freezes up around women.

584
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,160
Brady, lacking in self-confidence.

585
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,480
You just said you weren't gonna say their names.

586
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,520
I changed my mind.

587
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,160
Jody, the quote friend to girls.

588
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,720
Jody, friend to all girls.

589
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,560
Pradeep.

590
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,380
Oh, Jody?

591
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,220
Oh, nice, yeah.

592
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,880
We're gonna go have a picnic tomorrow

593
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,840
and it's gonna be great.

594
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,760
Oh, I have a picnic plan with Jody.

595
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,800
He's every girl's friend.

596
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,280
Pradeep over analyzes and talks too much.

597
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,480
Joe W. starts off strong but often fails fast.

598
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,680
Scott gets very nervous and stutters around women.

599
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,120
Fred, 40-year-old virgin plus five.

600
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,960
He's 45.

601
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,200
And then lastly, there's Steven Poon or Spoon

602
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
who does not know how to approach women.

603
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,400
He was eliminated first.

604
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,240
Hi, I'm Spoon.

605
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,260
Wait, you get eliminated from this game?

606
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,920
You get eliminated from the game.

607
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,680
You'll never talk to women.

608
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
Get out of here.

609
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,760
You'll never be able to talk to women.

610
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,460
I feel like we all got eliminated from this game

611
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,440
because even if you miss,

612
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,280
I never watch the pickup artists,

613
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,520
but I feel like on a daily basis,

614
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,920
I experienced the ripples, the shockwaves

615
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,520
that it sent out across our cultural landscape.

616
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,480
I'm so sad we weren't, we missed.

617
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,320
The reception on Wikipedia,

618
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,880
the initial viewer ratings were disappointing.

619
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Debuting with only 672,000 viewers.

620
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
That depends on who you are.

621
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Because to me, nobody watches this fucking show.

622
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,640
That does not disappoint me.

623
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
No, that actually makes me feel pretty good.

624
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,700
That appoints me a major way.

625
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,040
Griffin is appointed now to a higher level.

626
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,680
Fuck that show.

627
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,520
Fuck everybody.

628
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,400
Fuck all those guys.

629
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
Fuck the show.

630
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,060
Fuck mystery.

631
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,880
That show was executive produced by J.D. Roth,

632
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,000
who you'll remember as the Finder's Keepers.

633
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
Maybe bring it back on the O network.

634
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,860
Maybe on O and all women, gender-flipped pickup artists.

635
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,480
Just, oh, but that's the twist.

636
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,360
It's like at the end, women are judges

637
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,160
and they're just like, okay, behave.

638
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Nope, you did bad.

639
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,600
Be a good human being.

640
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,440
Oh, you failed.

641
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,260
You messed up.

642
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,640
No, no, no.

643
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's take a quick break and go to the Money Zone.

644
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,820
I'm coming.

645
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,960
My brother and my brother made a supporting part

646
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,800
by Squarespace.

647
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,080
Travis, what the hell is that?

648
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,160
Squarespace?

649
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,940
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

650
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,600
You tried RoundSpace, right?

651
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah.

652
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,680
Yeah, and how RoundSpace makes really shitty,

653
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,980
hard to make websites.

654
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,500
Well, Squarespace makes easy, good websites.

655
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,600
Why did they do that the first time around?

656
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,160
Well, cause they weren't sure what should they were like,

657
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,520
let's cut corners and they made round space.

658
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,680
And then they say, you know what?

659
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,160
Slap those corners back on there.

660
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,120
That's where all the programming was.

661
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,960
Yeah.

662
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,920
And they glued the corners back on

663
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,280
and they made square space, square space.

664
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,240
Round space, by the way, round space is a,

665
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,400
is a UK based professional training and coaching outfit.

666
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,120
And you just really put them in the fucking trash.

667
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,160
Didn't you?

668
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,920
Well, or in the winter circle,

669
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,280
you're welcome for the free mention.

670
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,440
Back to Squarespace though.

671
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,160
Squarespace is a host to the MacaroyShows.com website

672
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,020
where you can find all of the Macaroy projects,

673
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,840
including YouTube stuff and other podcasts.

674
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,160
That's weird, this feels like a commercial for us.

675
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,000
Commercial for us.

676
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,980
Well, no, but hear me out.

677
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,820
Good twist.

678
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,500
Because I, when I started it, I envisioned like,

679
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,960
well, this is going to be tough.

680
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,920
So I'll just put a couple of links on there.

681
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,240
And then as I was doing it,

682
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I realized how not only easy, but also like versatile it was.

683
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,600
Like the things you're able to do with very, very,

684
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,880
very little expertise and knowledge of what you're doing.

685
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,320
And end up with a very professional looking website

686
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,400
that people have asked me like, well, who did this?

687
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,560
And it was like, I did it in about two hours

688
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,180
and I'm able to jump in and make edits and improve things

689
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,040
and add new stuff on a whim.

690
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,160
And it's so fast and easy.

691
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,300
And also I have, you know,

692
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,200
had professional websites made before

693
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,480
and as a cost effective option, Squarespace really,

694
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
really delivers.

695
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,020
I highly recommend it.

696
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,520
And you can start a free trial today.

697
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,140

And then if you're like, you know what?

701
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,480
I really liked the website.

702
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,020
I really liked the way this is looking.

703
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,380
You pay to publish and trust me, you won't regret it.

704
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,460
Squarespace.

705
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,880
Nope, you should Squarespace.

706
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,380
Squarespace, you should Squarespace.

707
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,520
Get your Squarespace on your left now.

708
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,320
I wanna tell y'all about Club W.

709
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,240
It's an exclusive club by which I mean,

710
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,680
you can get into it if you go to Club W

711
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,720
and go to their website and sign up for it.

712
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,560
But it is still, it's very exclusive

713
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,960
because what does that W stand for?

714
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,320
Weapons.

715
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,160
What?

716
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,000
They send you a new weapon every week.

717
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,880
This week I got a big old club

718
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,120
and it's got a gun in the handle of it.

719
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,880
It's a gun club.

720
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,720
It's not true.

721
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,040
No, the W actually stands for Winslow.

722
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,000
It is a club and we all get together every week

723
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,280
and we talk about our favorite sort of Family Matters stuff.

724
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,120
Just so you know.

725
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,960
That's also not true.

726
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,780
Not true.

727
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,620
Tell the truth.

728
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,240
Okay, Club W is an exclusive club

729
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,220
where we talk about Family Matters.

730
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,060
Guys, I can't.

731
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,900
No, it's not.

732
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,360
It's about wine.

733
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
It is a wine club.

734
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,320
It's a wine thing.

735
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,560
You fucking know that.

736
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,120
Club W, it allows you to sort of get past all of the stuff

737
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,200
where you're shopping for wine

738
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,680
and you don't know what any of the words

739
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
or like flavor profiles mean

740
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,320
and you just want some wine to have with your fish

741
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,720
or your steak or whatever.

742
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,800
But you want something good?

743
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,960
Well, Club W's got your back.

744
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,480
It's a revolutionary new wine club

745
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,200
that sends wine directly to your door.

746
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,960
Saves you all the trips to the grocery store,

747
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,760
all the like being awkward, standing in the wine aisle,

748
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,480
just like picking up bottles and looking at them

749
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,040
and pretending to know what the fuck they're all about.

750
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,160
Club W asks you a six question quiz

751
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,780
and then it sort of determines what your palate is

752
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,620
based on that quiz.

753
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,120
So every bottle that you get

754
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,400
is perfectly tailored to your tastes.

755
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,480
It works directly with vineyards,

756
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,560
cuts out the middlemen, saves you money

757
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,860
and it's got a no risk guarantee

758
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,660
that you will love drinking what they send you.

759
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,000
Right now, Club W is offering listeners $20 off

760
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000

It gets better.

They'll pay for your shipping

765
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,080

766
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280

770
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,680
Here's a message to Emily Lloyd from Liam S. Smith

771
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,480
and it reads, dear Emily, AKA Reagan,

772
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,680
I hope this belated, you know it homie,

773
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,560
birthday message fills you with delight

774
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,360
and reminds you that you have peeps in your corner

775
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,960
all the way across the sea.

776
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,000
Happy birthday.

777
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,640
I hope you and Patty keep killing it in the UK.

778
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,400
Never forget, you are Emily Lloyd.

779
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
Oh, that's so fucking fresh, isn't it?

780
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Wow.

781
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,640
Never forget, you are Emily Lloyd.

782
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,780
In all things, you are Emily Lloyd.

783
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,160
You are constant as the Northern Star.

784
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,800
That's so good that for a second there,

785
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
I thought I was Emily Lloyd.

786
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,560
No, she is Emily Lloyd.

787
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,140
Today, we are all Emily Lloyd.

788
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,220
Lots of love, your pal, Liam.

789
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,300
You are Emily Lloyd.

790
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,040
You are the best. And you are Emily Lloyd.

791
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,480
And you are Emily Lloyd.

792
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,800
And you, no, okay.

793
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,560
No, you are the Northern Star, the Polaris

794
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,920
around which all of us must navigate.

795
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,400
You are Emily Lloyd.

796
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,040
This is actually from your pal, Liam,

797
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,160
and everyone else, but they didn't pay for this message.

798
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,500
I like that, Liam.

799
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,340
Fuck them.

800
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,520
Yep, fuck them. Put up or shut up.

801
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Got another message here.

802
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,040
This one's for Jer and Richie, and it's from Sian.

803
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,160
Sian com.

804
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,080
Sian.

805
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,880
Sian by the chandelier singer.

806
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,400
Jer and Richie's message is from Sian who says,

807
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,120
this is what it would feel like

808
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,140
if the brothers McRoy knew you existed.

809
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,760
Please enjoy this fleeting moment of recognition.

810
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,260
Yep.

811
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,560
Can the three of us just sort of say

812
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
our favorite thing about Jer and Richie?

813
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,560
Their names sound really good when you say them together.

814
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
They have a good mouth feel.

815
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,920
Jer and Richie.

816
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
I like the way that they're always together.

817
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,820
Like you never just see Jer, you never just see Richie.

818
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,040
It's a really pretty sweet package deal.

819
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,280
Jer can jump really high,

820
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,240
and Richie is gluten intolerant.

821
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah.

822
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
Which I like.

823
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,740
Jer can jump really high.

824
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,580
At least more bread for me.

825
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,020
Jer can jump really high and Richie can duck really fast.

826
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,280
It makes for a lot of really fun-

827
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,120
Yeah, they do like-

828
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,940
Antics and stunts.

829
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,780
You're just like walking in the movie theater

830
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,760
and then all of a sudden you look behind you

831
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,040
and just whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

832
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,280
New to Maximum Fun,

833
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,480

And if it's not clear, this is a comedy podcast.

843
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,840
Beef out.

844
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,520
Recently I helped a friend move.

845
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,360
Can I- Working for-

846
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,180
No.

847
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,020
What?

848
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,240
I just want to do a yahoo.

849
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,520
Okay, go for it.

850
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,440
Actually, I think I want to,

851
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,900
somebody sent me a tweet.

852
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,400
Okay, that's not really-

853
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Well, no, it's pretty,

854
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,940
this tweet is pretty dark.

855
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,200
I don't know if I should say the user or not.

856
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,080
Let's talk about it first

857
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,380
and we can say like,

858
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,580
if we want to like mention the user's name.

859
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,960
But it's a picture of,

860
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,200
apparently it's very dark,

861
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,160
but apparently it's a picture of them

862
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
just like smoking a joint.

863
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,380
And they said,

864
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,360
Good Games, Inc.,

865
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,520
which is almost the name of the video game podcast

866
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,840
I do with Nick Robinson at Polygon.

867
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
That's cool games, Inc.

868
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,000
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

869
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,080
Enjoying a jazz cigarette at home.

870
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,400
And it's just like a picture of them like,

871
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,840
having, having,

872
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,340
smoking a Padoober.

873
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,800
And then I sort of went through their account

874
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,700
and that's exclusively this person's activities.

875
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,640
Trends like these.

876
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

877
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,440
Getting some exercise.

878
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,260
Playing some b-ball.

879
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,100
And sure enough,

880
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,240
here's a picture of a basketball court.

881
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,600
Got one, Oh No Ross and Kerry.

882
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,280
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast.

883
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,760
Relaxing before picking up my wife from work.

884
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,820
And this is just like a picture from a, a bed.

885
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,380
Where somebody's lying down.

886
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,240
That's so fresh.

887
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm like really very into it.

888
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,400
It's, it's Francis Reed.

889
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,760
Maybe, maybe they've only been doing this

890
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,040
for about a month or so,

891
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,000
but I'm into this.

892
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,820
Well, first of all,

893
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,480
I love when people send me a picture of them doing drugs.

894
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,080
Cause I see that I'm like fucking cool.

895
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Yes.

896
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,920
Yes.

897
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,740
My people.

898
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,540
I love drugs.

899
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,380
Drugs.

900
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,200
Top-notch.

901
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,400
It's so important in, in there's just a flood

902
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,200
of social media presences in the world.

903
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,280
And so important to establish like what's your brand.

904
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,120
You know, what's your, what's your thing.

905
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,740
And if your thing is letting podcasts know

906
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,800
what you're doing while you're listening to them.

907
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,680
Guys, listen, if you ever are listening to us,

908
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,360
make our jokes and you say,

909
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,440
this seems like the kind of thing

910
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,040
I would love to spark up to.

911
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,880
Don't be afraid.

912
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
We're not fucking cops.

913
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,420
We will not knock you out.

914
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,560
Send me those pics of you sparking one up to our jokes.

915
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,240
And I want to be, I want to be clear.

916
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,960
It doesn't have to just be that.

917
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,000
If you're also like slamming a brew.

918
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm gonna go ahead and say it's explicitly

919
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,960
sparking up a joint.

920
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,000
I want pictures of people slamming brews.

921
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay.

922
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,360
Francis hasn't limited himself to that.

923
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,480
Francis, he tweeted at Julien Loves Music.

924
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,380
What I'm doing while listening to your podcast,

925
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,720
making tuna pasta bake.

926
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,760
That's so great.

927
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Like that's such a great account.

928
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,600
Here's what I'm gonna give.

929
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,480
I'm gonna give the information, W-I-D-W-I-L-T-Y-P

930
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,920
with an at before it.

931
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,960
This is a fucking good account.

932
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,080
If you see this person tweeting, please tweet at them.

933
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,400
Like you're crushing it right now.

934
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
Nice dude.

935
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,080
Blazing up another drew.

936
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,480
You know what I'm doing while listening to your podcast?

937
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,920
Forging an ax.

938
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,720
There's one where he's just forging an ax.

939
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, that's.

940
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
Is it that different podcasts

941
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
inspire him to do different things?

942
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,880
Or is he just like relegated that like,

943
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,800
I only listen to Hello from the Magic Tavern

944
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
while I forge an ax?

945
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,040
Let's do a Yahoo.

946
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

947
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,360
Thank you, Morgan.

948
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

949
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,840
Following this person right now.

950
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,240
U2K, at U2K, heart heart.

951
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,240
Who says, who believes Bruce Willis is a Yahoo user?

952
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,200
I accidental found a Bruce Willis user account

953
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,680
and I fan boxed that user's, what?

954
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,520
What?

955
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,560
Is that like shadow boxing?

956
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,440
And I fan boxed that user's

957
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,920
and also asked him a few Q if he really is.

958
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,920
Then he knows my husband and can answer those four Q.

959
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,600
Over 3000 idiots answered that user's Q

960
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,400
and many stared it, et cetera.

961
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,920
How stupid are people?

962
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,320
Can anyone in Yahoo verify that it's him?

963
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
I just called that user out.

964
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,400
I call him, I call him a lair.

965
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,840
And if he could answer those four Q's, I'd know for real.

966
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,880
Okay, okay, okay, okay, all right.

967
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

968
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
So it's basically like,

969
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,840
tell me something only Bruce Willis would know?

970
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,880
Okay, so I think just sort of reading,

971
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,120
I think this may be written in,

972
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,080
is there a different version of English

973
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,360
that reads like Arabic

974
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,800
where you're supposed to go right to left?

975
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,680
Cause that's the only way

976
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,600
that I can sort of piece this one together.

977
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,640
Is there a part in this question

978
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,080
where this person says their husband knows Bruce Willis?

979
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,320
I think it says their hubby knows Bruno

980
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,240
and I know things, he's relayed information to me

981
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,800
that only the real Bruno would know.

982
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,080
I don't want any fake Brunos in the mix.

983
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,680
So this person asked questions maybe about,

984
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,640
hey, if it's really you, Bruce,

985
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,320
tell me what my husband's favorite animal is.

986
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,540
You would know.

987
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,680
Do you think Bruno uses Yahoo Answers?

988
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,040
How else does he find stuff out?

989
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,000
That is a good question.

990
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,680
How do you learn stuff?

991
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,400
Sometimes I like to think of like,

992
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm wishing on the same big bright stars Bruno,

993
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,360
cause like I think about like he has to

994
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,880
at least accidentally have stumbled onto Yahoo Answers

995
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,840
at some point and just like,

996
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,720
maybe it was the same time

997
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,080
that I was having a session on Yahoo.

998
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,440
We've passed 300.

999
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,400
What if he's listening right now?

1000
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,080
What if he's listening to this going,

1001
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,720
I am a Yahoo user, I found it through your show.

1002
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,240
No, that's too much to ask.

1003
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
I would just be happy to know

1004
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,280
that we both use the same website at a certain point.

1005
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,860
You probably both use Google.

1006
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,400
What do you think is a better album title?

1007
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,700
Bruce Willis' The Return of Bruno

1008
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,700
or Aerosmith's Hunkin' on Bobo?

1009
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,720
Between those two, which is the better album title?

1010
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Bruno, if we could somehow do like a gray album mashup

1011
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,240
of the two, Hunkin' on Bruno.

1012
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,800
Hunkin' on Bruno, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,560
And thank you Justin for that mind voyage

1014
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,760
that just discovered the name of episode 302

1015
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,200
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1016
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,040
Yeah.

1017
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,860
Yeah.

1018
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,700
Yeah.

1019
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,200
A lot of harmonica work by Steven Tyler

1020
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,280
on Hunkin' on Bobo.

1021
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,120
Yeah.

1022
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,440
And I know you might be thinking,

1023
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,480
where did you get that fucking crazy name?

1024
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,260
Joe Perry stated in a radio interview,

1025
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,460
we just know that it's a phrase that sounds jazzy,

1026
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,680
jazzy-ish, nasty-ish, so it works for us.

1027
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,520
It is nasty.

1028
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,360
I wouldn't say it was nasty-ish.

1029
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,300
I would just say, remove the ish from that.

1030
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,040
It's just plain nasty.

1031
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,840
It's a nasty name when you're a nasty boy.

1032
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,680
Nasty Joe Perry.

1033
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,520
This is a fun sort of thought experiment,

1034
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,280
a thought spearmint.

1035
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,160
Think of a sex act that could not be described

1036
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,720
as Hunkin' on Bobo.

1037
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,360
Now write it down on a piece of paper

1038
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,480
and mail it to P.O. Box.

1039
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,600
Butt stuff?

1040
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,440
No?

1041
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,260
No.

1042
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,680
It's like the universal sex solvent.

1043
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,720
Like everything can fit into Hunkin' on Bobo.

1044
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,560
A Billy job?

1045
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,360
I think that might be the actual definition

1046
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,680
of Hunkin' on Bobo.

1047
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,560
Yeah, all of them.

1048
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,480
All of them.

1049
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,680
Just like really effin' the S out of a clown

1050
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,000
that's a little on the nose.

1051
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,480
And it would be on the nose.

1052
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,040
The Return of Bruno was an album released by Bruce Willis.

1053
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,560
If It Don't Kill You, It Just Makes You Stronger

1054
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,640
is an album by Bruce Willis.

1055
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,460
Excellent.

1056
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,480
And his third album, released in 1999, is-

1057
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,780
1999, 1999?

1058
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,280
Well, it's classic Bruce Willis.

1059
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,240
So they've apparently taken some of the biggest hits

1060
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,480
from his first two albums

1061
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,240
and turned it into sort of a greatest hits

1062
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,400
called classic Bruce Willis.

1063
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,840
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1064
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,140
Did he name his first album Return of Bruno?

1065
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,400
Yes, Travis.

1066
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,080
He did do this thing you said.

1067
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,920
Now, was this a-

1068
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,760
Was this a-

1069
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,560
He put return in his first album?

1070
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,400
Now- Yes.

1071
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,320
Can I just real quick, can we establish,

1072
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,600
was it a Chris Gaines fugue state?

1073
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,840
Or was this the same,

1074
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,320
this is a Bruce Willis you know and love,

1075
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,880
only this time he's doing something a little bit different,

1076
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,160
which is to say he's honking on Bobo.

1077
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,940
No, it was a tie-in with Hudson Hawk.

1078
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,720
It is-

1079
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,200
Okay, so the Return of Bruno-

1080
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,560
Oh boy, we're really getting into it now.

1081
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,680
You gotta go deep,

1082
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,240
cause like I've been obsessed with the name of this album

1083
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,080
forever.

1084
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:30,080
Apparently there was also a one hour atrio special.

1085
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,320
It is a mockumentary starring Bruce Willis

1086
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,760
as his fictitious alter ego, Bruno Radolini.

1087
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,200
It was indeed a Chris Gaines fugue state.

1088
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,680
Oh shit.

1089
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,880
Yeah.

1090
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,720
Yeah.

1091
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,480
Yeah.

1092
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,300
What the fuck?

1093
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,140
Fuck, dude.

1094
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,600
You know that this motherfucker covered Secret Agent Man?

1095
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,320
Yeah, I can't, I literally can't.

1096
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,680
I'm looking at my copy of Surrogates right now

1097
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,320
and I'm weeping and we need to move on

1098
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,240
cause it's starting to hurt.

1099
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,400
Izzy Aya, who answers user.

1100
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,760
Has he ever said-

1101
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,320
I would have said no before.

1102
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,140
Yeah.

1103
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm starting to feel very confident-

1104
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,200
He might not be, but Bruno might be.

1105
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,480
Maybe Bruno, oh man, no, I don't use it,

1106
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,360
but Bruno, he loves it.

1107
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,200
What?

1108
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,400
He won't shut up about it.

1109
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,320
Won't shut up about it.

1110
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,880
I don't even know how to use a computer.

1111
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,720
It's a computer, Bruce.

1112
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
It's a computer, it's pronounced computer.

1113
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,360
I'm just looking at on Yahoo.

1114
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
Oh, what'd you find?

1115
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,000
I've been, it's just a fucking look

1116
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,560
on he's giving on this album cover.

1117
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,400
No, it's very good.

1118
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,560
It's like, oh yeah, it's me, Brucey boy.

1119
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,040
And I'm here to sing you some tunes.

1120
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,940
It's me, I'm back, I'm Bruno.

1121
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,560
It should be like, it's a Bruce Willis solo album.

1122
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,040
The only acceptable look is like penance.

1123
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,300
Like, I'm sorry.

1124
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,920
I know you bought this cause you enjoy my acting.

1125
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,780
Do you like the song, Secret Agent Man?

1126
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,040
I'm just like, I did a quick Yahoo search

1127
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,980
for Bruce Willis, Bruno on Yahoo Answers.

1128
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,400
Found this one is by Yahoo Answers user.

1129
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,580
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1130
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,160
Is Bruce Willis a good singer?

1131
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,280
Do you remember the return of Bruno in the 90s?

1132
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,520
Do you remember the cover version

1133
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,980
of Under the Boardwalk he did?

1134
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,600
So this could ostensibly be Bruno asking the question.

1135
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,440
Somebody says, I am sure he's a good of a singer

1136
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,680
as he is a Yahoo Answers user, lol.

1137
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,440
So this is eight years ago.

1138
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,300
Starting to think there may be a little bit of credibility.

1139
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,600
Somebody says, yes, a good bedroom singer.

1140
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,620
The fuck, dude.

1141
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,460
What?

1142
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,300
What does that mean?

1143
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,460
He's thirsty for that bobo.

1144
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,700
When he's hungry for that bobo,

1145
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,900
he's really going to town lyrically.

1146
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,660
His cover of Under the Boardwalk

1147
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,460
was a number two massive smash in the UK.

1148
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,100
Hey, are you okay right now?

1149
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,460
Are you doing all right?

1150
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,580
Seems like you made Bruce Willis a big singing sensation

1151
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,100
over there with this cover of 150 year old song.

1152
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,140
In episode, I just Googled Yahoo Answers Bruce Willis.

1153
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,460
We are one of the top results

1154
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,580
because apparently in episode 74 of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

1155
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,740
we address the question,

1156
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,100
how can I overcome my fear of Bruce Willis?

1157
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:16,100
Do you want to read a question, Justin?

1158
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,300
Yeah, I'd love that.

1159
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,620
Recently, I helped a friend move

1160
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,920
working for about six hours for no compensation

1161
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,460
other than a promised dinner that never came.

1162
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,180
While humping carry a TV downstairs,

1163
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,860
I tripped over a hole in the sidewalk

1164
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,400
and hit the TV into the ground.

1165
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,180
It looked fine till I plugged it in

1166
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,900
when we saw what looked like green ooze.

1167
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,580
It's turning into a Goosebumps book.

1168
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,220
When I saw what looked like green ooze

1169
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,060
dripping down the picture.

1170
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,660
I just imagined the cover

1171
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,740
and it's two boys sitting on a couch

1172
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,660
while a green ooze comes out of a TV

1173
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,060
and then underneath it and that Goosebumps font,

1174
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,100
it just says, I fucked up.

1175
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,660
And that's the name of the cover.

1176
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,100
Sorry, Derek, my R.L. Stine.

1177
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
Aw, fuck, Derek.

1178
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,060
I really goobered it up this time, bud.

1179
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,180
I goosed your bums, I'm sorry, Derek.

1180
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,140
Why is there a green goo in the TV?

1181
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,980
Okay.

1182
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,700
Slime time, colon, I done fucked up, Derek.

1183
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,940
Okay, it looked fine till I plugged it in

1184
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,020
when we saw what looked like green ooze

1185
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,380
dripping down the picture on the top right.

1186
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,140
What do I owe my friend?

1187
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,500
I offered my slightly smaller TV, a 45 inch,

1188
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,180
to replace the 50 inch I damaged,

1189
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,840
but he wants to replace it with a new one.

1190
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,380
How much should I contribute to a $450 replacement

1191
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,780
for a mistake I made while helping for free?

1192
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,580
That's from Alex Martin.

1193
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,460
I'm gonna say none, none dollars.

1194
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,780
None dollars, right?

1195
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,900
Like if he had wanted somebody who wouldn't break his shit,

1196
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,780
he should have hired a professional.

1197
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,660
It's kind of the risk of like moving.

1198
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,720
Yeah, when you roll up to help a friend move,

1199
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,420
you're like, hey, so do you want

1200
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,140
the $50 Derek insurance plan?

1201
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,940
So if I break any, you give me $50,

1202
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,380
if I break any of your shit, over, please.

1203
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,220
That's not how any of that works.

1204
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,180
That's not how any of the,

1205
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,500
like you've carried a TV in your life, what?

1206
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,420
Like maybe 10 times?

1207
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,840
Like I'll tell you this,

1208
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,900
it's a damn sight short of like 10,000 hours.

1209
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,700
You need to be an expert TV carrier.

1210
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,060
They should have known better.

1211
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,660
I would say that, especially if your friend,

1212
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,780
and it doesn't sound like from the question,

1213
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,060
isn't asking you to pay for it,

1214
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,780
I think that you don't have to feel any kind of guilt

1215
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,860
or over any kind of like remorse.

1216
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,660
But what happened, because you know, accidents happen.

1217
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,620
Now, if you had like gotten really mad

1218
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,020
because no pizza was delivered

1219
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,220
and you'd smash the TV on the ground,

1220
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,460
it's a different scenario.

1221
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah, and also the fact that he doesn't want to replace it

1222
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,260
with the 45 inch tells me this is just somebody

1223
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,220
who's got a hankering to buy a new TV.

1224
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,080
And it's pretty exciting.

1225
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,580
They might have put that green ooze on there themselves

1226
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,340
because it doesn't make a damn lick of sense otherwise.

1227
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,380
Oh, you think they, maybe they jellied up,

1228
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,540
maybe they jellied up the base

1229
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,060
before you started carrying it.

1230
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:54,120
And then slippy, slip, slip on that raspberry jam.

1231
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,960
Oops-a-daisies.

1232
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,820
Oops-a-daisies, well, that's on you, Derek.

1233
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,780
Here's the TV I want.

1234
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,840
I have a coupon for it right here in my pocket.

1235
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,260
Isn't that weird?

1236
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,060
I think you're gonna want to go with this 50 inch.

1237
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,660
The blacks are real black.

1238
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,780
It's got really good clarity.

1239
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,140
The sound's just amazing.

1240
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,100
And there's just plenty of green ooze in there.

1241
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,340
Now you want to be careful

1242
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,420
because if that green ooze gets loose,

1243
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,100
it will ruin the TV and curse you forever.

1244
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,420
But you're gonna love the definition.

1245
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,020
Everything you do to destroy this,

1246
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,260
let's just call it what it is, monster blood,

1247
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,500
is only gonna make it double in size and volume.

1248
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,980
But that's 1082 peas, so yeah.

1249
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,900
That ooze gets you that two extra peas.

1250
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,780
And nobody's quite sure what peas are still,

1251
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,340
like to this day.

1252
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,700
But I think they,

1253
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,780
when you're watching the Civil War on it,

1254
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,980
it just makes it.

1255
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,380
You're gonna love it.

1256
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,700
But again, if it is released,

1257
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,100
it's gonna eat your friends,

1258
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,740
it's gonna eat your babysitter,

1259
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,820
and every person that eats,

1260
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,820
it's gonna make a morning snack.

1261
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,420
Your dog's gonna eat some of it

1262
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,820
and it's gonna taste like lime jello,

1263
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,180
but then that dog, kiss goodbye.

1264
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,740
Yeah, it's gonna turn into a monster doggie.

1265
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,140
You're gonna have to kill it with a pickaxe.

1266
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,980
Yep.

1267
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,700
It'll be $450, please.

1268
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,140
This is a good book.

1269
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,700
By the way, I'd read this book.

1270
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:11,160
My favorite Goosebumps books are Camp Nightmare,

1271
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,860
the Choose Your Own Adventure one set in the amusement park,

1272
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,660
and then The Slime Time.

1273
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,600
Oops, Derek, I fucked up.

1274
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,660
TV shopping.

1275
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,940
My favorite is The Beast,

1276
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,320
which is a book Arlstein wrote,

1277
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,300
but does not, because it's set in King's Island,

1278
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,260
a favorite haunt of ours as a young man,

1279
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,500
but it is not in the officially licensed

1280
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,540
Goosebumps franchise, I guess you could say.

1281
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,860
It's too explicit.

1282
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:40,860
I like his sex romp, Fifty Shades of Green,

1283
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,880
and this one is, they have sex with monster blood?

1284
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,380
Okay, well, listen, that's gonna do it for us.

1285
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,300
Thank you so much for listening to our program,

1286
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,380
my brother, my brother, and me.

1287
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,380
Don't go anywhere, we have huge news.

1288
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,420
Huge news. Oh, sorry, yes.

1289
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,740
Don't change that dial.

1290
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,820
This is huge.

1291
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,300
This is huge.

1292
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,220
We've got two big, big, big live shows,

1293
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,460
and they're happening very, very, very soon.

1294
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,520
Unnervingly soon, I would say.

1295
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,660
Well, Travis, why don't you tell everybody?

1296
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,020
You seem very excited about it.

1297
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:16,340
It is June 3rd and June 4th,

1298
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:21,340
so like three weeks from now. Less than a fucking month, yeah.

1299
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,620
On June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd,

1300
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,180
we are going to be in Washington, D.C.,

1301
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,380
and on June 4th, we are going to be in New York City.

1302
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,960
I know we should have maybe been more explicit last time.

1303
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,060
I feel bad, actually, on how much we goofed on people,

1304
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,740
but we've never been to Washington, D.C. before,

1305
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,700
and we have a ton of listeners there.

1306
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,300
At least I fucking hope we do.

1307
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,820
Barry Obama called and said, please come do a show.

1308
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,660
I really want to see it.

1309
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,340
I'm like, what are we going to do, say no?

1310
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,740
D.C., June 3rd, we're going to be at the Lincoln Theater.

1311
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,900
You can find tickets for that show

1312
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,900
at bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-D-C, 2016.

1313
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,940
Bit of a convoluted URL, but I bet it's the best we can do.

1314
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,860
Well, that's only because I assume

1315
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,220
we'll be doing D.C. in 2017 and 2018 and 2019

1316
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,120
when everybody rolls up and shows us their love.

1317
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,860
Again, I would say we'll never go again,

1318
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,740
so you better make it count.

1319
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,700
Again, Lincoln Theater, June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd,

1320
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,340
bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-D-C, 2016,

1321
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,180
and then New York City, Saturday, June 4th.

1322
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,420
New York City!

1323
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,060
Okay, we're going to be at the PlayStation Theater,

1324
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,020
which is very exciting.

1325
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,340
Can't wait to hang out with Crash Bandicoot.

1326
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,180
Playing Uncharted 4.

1327
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,540
Can't wait to hang out with Crash Bandicoot,

1328
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,740
all my friends.

1329
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,740
That's bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M-N-Y-C, 2016.

1330
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,700
You can find tickets for there.

1331
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,300
And when do the tickets go on sale, Trav?

1332
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,780
They go on sale May 13th, that's this Friday,

1333
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,980
at noon Eastern Standard Time.

1334
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,940
So last time we came to New York,

1335
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,700
we played at a theater that was like 90 seats,

1336
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,900
and we sold out literally instantly.

1337
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,060
PlayStation Theater is much, much bigger.

1338
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,420
I have no idea how quickly they're going to sell in D.C.,

1339
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,220
but hopefully it won't be as big a shit show,

1340
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,900
but we cannot add extra shows to the docket.

1341
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,700
It's just these two, so get your tickets fast.

1342
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,800
And also just know that in the past,

1343
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,780
we don't put the tickets on sale.

1344
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,400
They go on sale from the venue.

1345
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,820
So that noon, we tried to really push the people

1346
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,260
to wait till noon, but it wouldn't hurt

1347
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,280
maybe to start checking in 15 minutes beforehand

1348
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,200
just to see if they're live yet.

1349
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,740
We've had issues with that in the past, so just heads up.

1350
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,620
We also are, it's not just gonna be us.

1351
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,260
That would be boring.

1352
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,940
We are going to be joined at both shows

1353
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:42,180
by Saw Bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine

1354
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,660
that I co-host with my wife, Sydney,

1355
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,780
and we've got special podcast guests

1356
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,520
for different, for both of the shows, right?

1357
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,580
Yes, that is correct.

1358
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,220
In New York City, you're gonna be able to see

1359
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,900
Still Buffering before Saw Bones,

1360
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,260
and then in D.C., you're gonna get to see Schmanners,

1361
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,220
which is the show that I do with my wife

1362
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,620
about etiquette in the modern world.

1363
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,900
It'll be our first live show.

1364
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
We're very, very, very excited.

1365
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,600
Yeah, first for Still Buffering, too,

1366
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,460
so that's gonna be huge, big, big shows,

1367
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,640
three podcasts for the price of one.

1368
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,480
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

1369
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,620
Now, if you wanna see a live Rosebuddies,

1370
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,560
you tell me what the fuck that looks like.

1371
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,860
You just tell me how to fucking do that.

1372
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,400
Do we spend an hour making the audience

1373
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,820
watch an episode of The Bachelor before we talk about it?

1374
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,660
I don't know, I don't know.

1375
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,500
It's the eternal puzzle.

1376
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,340
We'll also tweet when the tickets go live, so just make sure.

1377
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,180
Just don't sleep on it,

1378
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,220
because I'm pretty sure they're reserved seats,

1379
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,680
so don't sleep on it, just buy your tickets.

1380
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,060
If you got questions for us,

1381
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,140
send to nbmbam at maximumfun.org.

1382
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,940
Travis already mentioned mackerelroyshows.com.

1383
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,280
There's a lot of other great max fun shows.

1384
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,780
Beef and Dairy Network is like my favorite new thing.

1385
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,580
It's so funny.

1386
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,740
Listen to it, it's like 10 minutes long.

1387
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,940
I also wanna say, Dear Hank and John,

1388
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,560
the podcast that Hank Green and John Green do,

1389
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,140
they've plugged us a couple times,

1390
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,300
and it's a really great show.

1391
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,140
It is a fantastic show.

1392
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,100
And they're absolutely lovely people.

1393
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,460
It's like our show if we were geniuses.

1394
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,740
Had anything to fucking offer the world.

1395
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,360
I got to hang out with Hank.

1396
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,300
He did an episode of Can I Pet Your Dog?

1397
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,400
And he's just an absolutely lovely human being.

1398
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,780
So thank you to them, and go check out their show.

1399
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,260
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters,

1400
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,540
who used for a theme song, It's a Departure,

1401
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,660
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1402
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,920
It is such a good album.

1403
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,580
I started listening to When I Pretend to Fall a lot,

1404
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,940
which is weird, it's not usually a summer album.

1405
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,400
That's more of a fall, winter album for me,

1406
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,100
but it's a wonderful album, go check it out.

1407
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,500
And we have merch on Max Fun Store.

1408
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,040
It's maxfunstore.com, you can find it all there.

1409
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,420
Perfect, that's gonna do it for us.

1410
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,060
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo to sing this album?

1411
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,940
Hell yes, sent in by riding high Zoe Kinski.

1412
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,740
Thank you Zoe, it's by Yahoo Answers user, Brian Cohen,

1413
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,740
who asks, if animals don't want to be eaten,

1414
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,160
why are they made of food?

1415
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,300
I'm Justin McElroy.

1416
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,300
I'm Travis McElroy.

1417
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1418
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,660
Did my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad?

1419
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,880
Square on the lips.

1420
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,880
Hey good girls, do you wanna just say, hey I wanna.

1421
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,960
Maximumfun.org.

1422
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,020
Comedy and culture.

1423
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,060
Artist owned.

1424
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,260
Listener supported.

1425
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,380
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

1426
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,360
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

1427
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,480
This is gonna be a really fun look at things

1428
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,420
that I find curious, whether it's a menstrual cup,

1429
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,020
it might be the Romanov family, it might be fracking,

1430
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,980
it could be Carly Fiorina, I don't even know, who knows.

1431
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,420
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

1432
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,540
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

1433
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,040
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

1434
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,460
I'm gonna be learning the things.

1435
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,180
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

1436
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,340
for you to expand your baby brains with me

1437
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,660
and have a super fun time, so I can't wait to see you

1438
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:01,660
on our first episode of Getting Curious.
