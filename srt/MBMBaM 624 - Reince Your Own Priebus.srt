1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,100
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,900
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,700
One, two, three, four!

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,400
It's the start of something beautiful.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,800
My life, it feels like life.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,600
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,600
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,600
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with two.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,800
My life, oh, it's better with you.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,100
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,700
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm the sweet one, Griffin McElroy.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Oh yeah, so I remember this guy.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,300
So right there, Justin had done kind of different, like me, so I was feeling a little different.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,200
I just had a sip of coffee, and I was looking at Griffin in his tank top.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,800
I remember that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,700
What?

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,900
Yo, bite!

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Yeah, yeah, explain it.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,700
So we do a lot of episodes, and I was thinking about when we've done over 600 at this point,

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
and I'm worried now that someone will ask us to go back and do commentary on them,

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,100
and I don't remember it at all.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,200
I couldn't tell you what we talked about last week.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,600
So I figured it would be more efficient to just record the commentary during the whole show.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
And they're not always great.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,300
They're not always great.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,100
And sometimes he tells us, oh, I've got the intro, and you get really worried.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,800
But this one I remember thinking was pretty fucking funny.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,900
I was busting up inside.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,100
Justin started laughing for no reason whatsoever.

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Sorry, if you're cracking me up talking about, and then this other thing happened with my kids.

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,600
Sorry, you're cracking me up.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I can talk over myself.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
It's fine.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,300
So...

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
I could tell Justin was having a really good time with it.

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,700
Justin was really enjoying himself.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,200
Now, what did you think, Travis?

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
What did you think of Justin when he kind of like,

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,100
you could tell he didn't actually understand what the bit was?

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Yeah, I could tell that.

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,900
And then there was complete silence for like 20 seconds.

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh yeah, I remember during this commentary that Griffin and I were talking about Justin not understanding the bit.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,000
And like, it just was clear that Justin wasn't funny.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,500
I don't remember Travis' commentary about our commentary.

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
He started talking like a grandpa.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
Do you remember when he started talking like a grandpa?

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't remember the evidence of the fact that he did not understand the bit

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because he started being like an old man.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm in the future doing commentary on it.

57
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,600
I get it.

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
He was really over-complicating it, if I remember correctly.

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,600
That's why we love Justin is because he tries his best every time.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
He has a great heart and a wonderful beard.

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
He quit the show right after this, if I remember correctly.

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,100
That's it, guys! I'm quitting the show!

63
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Yeah, I knew it.

64
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
There it was, Travis. You got it.

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You got it right there.

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
This is fucking stupid. You guys aren't even talking.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
We've just been sitting in silence.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Just me.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,100
Solo Mish.

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,600
And it turned out he was really mad because his Beanie Baby collection wasn't worth what he thought it was.

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And it was really eating at him.

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,600
But then, luckily, the market for Beanie Babies, if I remember a couple days later, really took off.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Getting all my babies together, keeping them clean, keeping them fresh, keeping them deodorized.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,100
That's a full-time job.

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,600
I got cats that love to hump Beanie Babies, and I just simply do not have the time or bandwidth.

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
When he got into making cat-slash-Beanie Baby pornography,

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
and he talked about it on the show a lot.

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
He acted like it wasn't his choice.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
He explicitly talked about first-generation Duchess Bear.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Which is, as you know, a limited edition for when Princess Diana died.

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
And this is the Beanie Baby about it.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
They're extremely valuable.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
He really spiraled after this point, because any time he thinks about Princess Diana,

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
he just starts to get uncontrollably...

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Let the conspiracy theory talk for me.

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
That's when it gets weird.

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
This is when he outlined the conspiracy theory about Princess Diana.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
He outlined it in great detail right now.

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And Seth Rogen was a part of it.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Don't talk over him talking about the conspiracy.

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
It wasn't a tunnel. This is what everybody misses.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
It wasn't a tunnel, it was a cave.

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
And it's like, why is there a cave there?

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay. Thanks, Rence Priebus.

95
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Thanks for building a cave there, Rence Priebus.

96
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh yeah, Priebus is in it all the way to the top.

97
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I did believe the bit about Priebus.

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, of course. Well, it's a convincing name.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Definitely not just a joke name that Justin pulled.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I really miss the days where we could talk a lot about Rence Priebus.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Yeah.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Is that his first name? Is that his first name?

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
He's saying a name.

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I think Justin's not entirely sure, and he just kind of takes a run at it every time.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
His name was Rence Priebus.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,600
It sounds like what the parent of a toddler would say during bath time.

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Like, hey, rinse your Priebus.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,600
And I remember Griffin said this thing about rinsing your Priebus, and it cracked me up really good.

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
You can rinse your own Priebus. You're old enough now.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
No one's going to rinse your Priebus for you once you get to kindergarten.

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Hey, leave your Priebus alone while you're at school.

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
We've got to be gentle with our Priebuses.

113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Well, that's just great.

114
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I guess we don't have much of a podcast today because it's just me flying solo,

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
unless my brothers would please just help me out a little bit.

116
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
A few jokes. One or two jokes. That's it.

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Sorry, Justin. I'll jump back in. Sorry, I was just so distracted looking at the news today.

118
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Uh-oh.

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
No, just in general. It's mostly local stuff. Back to school.

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Yeah, school supplies and gas prices have changed.

121
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
That's absolutely true.

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Should we do questions?

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Yes. I remember that we have a list of them here, and I would be happy.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Whoa.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Guys, I just wanted to look at the email list, and I want to tell you,

126
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I got a very real email from Dick Sporting, and there's an ellipsis, goods.

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Dick Sporting goods?

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Yeah.

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
And then the subject is, you've been chosen.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Whoa.

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
That feels so good.

132
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Hey, we know you've been putting in the sweat equity on the courts you're in.

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Yeah.

134
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Your name came up for a Yeti Hopper M20 cooler custom gift.

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Fuck yes.

136
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Whoa. It says it's the newest model yet.

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Whoa.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Hurry up. The number of prizes to be won is limited. Confirm now.

139
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Do we need to delay this recording?

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Well, I can join their loyalty program for free?

141
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, my God. Jesus, this is new being an idiot to not do this.

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Oh, my God. At the bottom it says,

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
if you no longer wish to receive these emails,

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,600
you may unsubscribe by clicking here or writing to,

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
and then there's an address in Las Vegas.

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Can you imagine a world where we're like, I'm tired of these spam emails.

147
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Someone get my pen and stamps and an envelope and paper.

148
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Fetch me my quill.

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I'll tell you exactly what I think of them.

150
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Dearest Dick's Sporting Goods,

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I have appreciated your info for the last several years,

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
but now I find it tedious.

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
And so I must unsubscribe.

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Sincerely, Justin McElroy Esquire.

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
P.S. I would like that tumbler, please.

156
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I get this spam email every week, guys.

157
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I search for Yeti.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
There's 30 emails about a fake Dick's Sporting Goods

159
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
telling you about this Yeti cooler that I've got to get.

160
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
They want you to get this cooler.

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
You've been chosen, Justin.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I've been chosen.

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
They can't just pick someone else.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Would you guys say this is our best episode

165
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
of My Brother and My Brother and Me yet, or just top 10?

166
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
I would say it's probably, I would say it's like number six for me.

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I was actually thinking before we started,

168
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
like what if this is the best one ever?

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Oh, wow.

170
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Still time.

171
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Okay.

172
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
My mother-in-law has repeatedly and seriously expressed interest

173
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
in buying my car when I'm ready to buy a new one,

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
which I'd typically be more than happy to do.

175
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
The problem is a long forgotten lunchbox in my trunk

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
has created a bit of a stink problem.

177
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
They have stinking quotes.

178
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Like I bet it's just a stink problem.

179
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I've removed the lunchbox, but a light funk lingers,

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,600
and I'm not confident in my ability to unstink this thing.

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
No.

182
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I convinced my mother-in-law she really doesn't want

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
any of my otherwise great car without having to explain

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
to her the embarrassing reason why.

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
It's from what that smell in Wisconsin.

186
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
This is what I'm talking about.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
And this is one of those things that I feel like,

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
and I don't watch the television program,

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
but I've just kind of like absorbed through osmosis

190
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
that there has been somebody on Shark Tank who's been like,

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
my special car distinctifying gel.

192
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
You rub it in.

193
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
And then like four of the people are like, I'm out.

194
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
It's bad business, but then usually Mark Cuban's like,

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I want to be your best friend on this.

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I got a stinky trunk.

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I love it.

198
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I know all these guys have never driven a car for a day in there.

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
They've never had to commute with their lunchbox in the back.

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I know the struggles of the real humans,

201
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
of which I am one, Mark Cuban.

202
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Just like you?

203
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And so this gel exists somewhere,

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
and you can apply it to the fabric,

205
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
and it will make the smell go away.

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I can't tell you where it is,

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,600
but I can tell you that your search for it would not be in vain.

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah.

209
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Now I have to say,

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
if there's one thing you take away from 624 episodes

211
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
and we've talked about this so many times.

213
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
This is why you don't put your lunchbox in the trunk, right?

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
We talk about this at least once a week.

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You got to keep your lunchbox at best.

216
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I strap it in, buckle it in in the passenger seat.

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Now someone's taken out the passenger seat.

218
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Well, then it's going to go on the center console,

219
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
or I strap it into one of the kids' car seats.

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,600
This is the number one stink problem causing issue in America today.

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Don't put your lunchbox in the trunk.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
There it is.

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I didn't get to say, we moved so fast past Mark Cuban,

224
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I didn't get to say my great thing about Mark Cuban.

225
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Oh, please do.

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Do you know what Mark Cuban's first job was?

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
He sold trash bags door to door.

228
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
That's nothing, Mark.

229
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
That's what he says his first job was,

230
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
selling trash bags door to door.

231
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
That's made up.

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
That's not a real job.

233
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Imagine a four-year-old Mark Cuban bangs on your door.

234
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
He's like, hey, hey, hey, you need trash bags?

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm your guy.

236
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And this isn't a question I think anyone should have to ask

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
a door-to-door salesman, but I think I would.

238
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
They're new, right?

239
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
They haven't been used.

240
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, they're trash bags.

241
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
They're convenient.

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
They're here.

243
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
What does it matter?

244
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I don't know about this.

245
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Okay, I did just Google Shark Tank Car Stink.

246
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Did I Google Shark Tank Car Stink?

247
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Oh, it's the FBI.

248
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
It's at Griffin's door.

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
They come to reclaim his computer.

250
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
There was a product called Pure Air with a Y

251
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
that was on season two, episode 203,

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
that was listed as it can make the car stink go away,

253
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
but it was also the world's only safe and natural product

254
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
on the market.

255
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
And the gentleman who was pitching the product is-

256
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Wait, end of sentence?

257
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
It's the world's only safe and natural product on the market?

258
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
It's the only world's safe air freshener on the market,

259
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and he demonstrated this by spraying it in his mouth.

260
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
You have debased yourself.

261
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
He left without an investment, unsurprisingly.

262
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
No clown man can walk in front of those hungry beasts

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
and be like, this is my stink go away spray.

264
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I put it in my mouth where the hot dogs make a bad smell.

265
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Like, no one's going to give you money for that, sir.

266
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Maybe some baking soda?

267
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Put some baking soda?

268
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

269
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
It works in the refrigerator?

270
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Just get an air freshener.

271
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Well, but they point out, okay, in the email, in a PS,

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
they point out like,

273
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
even if we did a really good job cleaning it,

274
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
what if like in the heat, you know,

275
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
you turn on the heat in the winter, boom,

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
there's like a lingering smell.

277
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
It's been waiting, it's like a sarcophagus,

278
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
and it's just like the seal cracks

279
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
and all the mummy stink comes out.

280
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Could you like sell it to her and say like,

281
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
oh, fair warning,

282
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,600
someone left their lunchbox in there at some point,

283
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
and it went bad.

284
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Not, I wouldn't do that.

285
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm a responsible adult, of course, but someone.

286
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
But somebody.

287
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
You could also just-

288
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I blame my kids.

289
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
You could just blame my kids.

290
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah.

291
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Justin's kids were in there.

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Justin's kids were in there.

293
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I left a bunch of fucking nuggets all over.

294
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Justin's kids were in your trunk.

295
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
They were playing a hiding game.

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Like a buck on that one episode of Bucky Brewster.

297
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,600
You could also just knock like a hundred off the price.

298
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I don't eat an egg.

299
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Mom-in-law, I don't usually do this.

300
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
You seem like a real nice lady,

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
and this is a real stinky trunk.

302
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
So I'm gonna-

303
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
This trunk smells like absolute nuggets.

304
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
You are going to need to deal with this,

305
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
and let me facilitate that.

306
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Now, do you need the coating on the undercarriage?

307
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Cause that's gonna raise that price right back up.

308
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Oh, oh, oh.

309
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You put your key in your trunk, snap it clean off.

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Oh, okay.

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
One thing you gotta know about this car,

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
this is a problem.

313
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
You can't open the trunk.

314
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
The trunk is for ballast only.

315
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Purely decorative.

316
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

317
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Fuck me.

318
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm just, I'm watching a video of this man spraying

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
on his map and it's like,

320
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
it makes me, it makes me bummed out.

321
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You'd think that would be a selling point,

322
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
but if someone did that in front of me

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
with a cleaning product, I'd be like,

324
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
so it doesn't work.

325
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Just say like-

326
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
So it's not real.

327
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
It doesn't work.

328
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
This is water.

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, to continue the must, as seen on TV trend,

330
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
you could just get some Flex Seal spray

331
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
and spray it all over the trunk,

332
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
and it will trap the stink particles.

333
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I love that.

334
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Like lamination.

335
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You're just laminating the trunk.

336
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Laminate the inside of the car.

337
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah.

338
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Okay, so I have a wizard for us.

339
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Okay, great.

340
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
His name is, his name is-

341
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Were you about to say Squidward?

342
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Or did I?

343
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Okay.

344
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Malfobians.

345
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, I know him.

346
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I went to college with him.

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
The Wizard of the Cloud referred me to him.

348
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
He ate pennies on dares.

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
It was the weirdest thing.

350
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
That's where he got his powers.

351
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah.

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
And then one day, he had a really bad bathroom,

353
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
and he had to make a change.

354
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Yeah.

355
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
So Deli sent this one in.

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Because he ate pennies.

357
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
This one really-

358
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Change.

359
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah.

360
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
This one really affected me

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
by like a deep and nostalgic level.

362
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I'm really excited to take us back.

363
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
This is how to relive the 2010s.

364
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, thank God.

365
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
The 2010s were known for a lot of important events.

366
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
The rise of social media, Brexit, heated politics,

367
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
LGBTQ plus activism, and unique fashion

368
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
to find the years from 2010 to 2019.

369
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,600
And those 10 years are where we contained

370
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
and sort of like fulfilled all of those different topics.

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah.

372
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Right.

373
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Because I think we can all-

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Those all got started and are wrapped up.

375
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
And solved.

376
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
All solved.

377
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Better.

378
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Fixed them.

379
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
So this article will show you a couple ways

380
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
to relive the 2010s.

381
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
You just described,

382
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
besides the LGBTQ plus activism,

383
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
which nice,

384
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
there wasn't a lot of great stuff in there.

385
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Why would I want to relive the 2010s?

386
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
The early 2010s were kind of fun, right?

387
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Like 2010, 2011, like we were having some fun with it.

388
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Yeah.

389
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
And you know what will be a good indicator of this?

390
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm going to look up like the top grossing movie

391
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
from 10, 11, and 12.

392
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Well, honey, we'll get to that in this article.

393
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, okay.

394
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
So why don't you not do that and ride with me?

395
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Why don't you just ride with me?

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
You're grabbing the steering wheel right now

397
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
and you're trying to jerk it away from the wizard's hands.

398
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
And when you do that, he puts a bug spell.

399
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Well, but the wizard's doing that thing

400
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
where he pretends to close his eyes and he's like,

401
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I don't know.

402
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
And I'm freaking out.

403
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I don't like it.

404
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
But he doesn't need his eyes to see, Travis.

405
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
He's a wizard.

406
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
He's going to do a bug spell on you.

407
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
You're going to turn into a big bug.

408
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh, like metamorphosis?

409
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Like, yeah, exactly like him.

410
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
So dressing like someone from the 2010s.

411
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Wear a combination of athletic and formal clothing.

412
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
In the late 20th century,

413
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
people began wearing leisure clothing

414
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
like t-shirts, jeans, and shorts.

415
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
This is not the late.

416
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
That kicked off.

417
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
You know what?

418
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
It's weird.

419
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
It feels like we've had shorts much longer.

420
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah.

421
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
In the 2010s, people did this too.

422
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Is that what it says?

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah.

424
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Wow.

425
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
2010s fashion is a bit different from 2000s fashion

426
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
because it is called athleisure.

427
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
It is a combination of leisure clothing

428
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
and fancy accessories.

429
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
That's where we get the name.

430
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
That's where we got it.

431
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Hey, how about wear festival fashion?

432
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Festival fashion was revived in the 2010s

433
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
when people like Vanessa Hudgens

434
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
wore flower crowns and boho-inspired clothing.

435
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Wear accessories that hippies wore in the 1960s.

436
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh, Lord.

437
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
All right.

438
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I think we can do all these.

439
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Get some hoop earrings

440
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
and just head to the Coachella in your mind.

441
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Wear millennial pink.

442
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Millennial pink was a trend starting from 2016

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
when celebrities wore varying shades of muted pink.

444
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
The pink ranged from salmon pink to rose quartz

445
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
and other shades of pink.

446
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
People weren't wearing pink before 2016?

447
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I didn't know that.

448
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Forget Lady Bird Johnson.

449
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
No, no, it started in 2016.

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Also, speaking of Lady Bird Johnson,

451
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
put on large sneakers.

452
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Large chunky sneakers made by brands such as Balenciaga

453
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
were a trend in the 2010s.

454
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Not now.

455
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Not now or before.

456
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Reading this is just making me realize

457
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
the 2010s, people were like,

458
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,600
it's so shitty out there right now.

459
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Can we just wear and act and be and live

460
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
like it is other time periods all kind of at this nexus?

461
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Moosh together.

462
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Moosh it, moosh it.

463
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I want my Balenciaga festival fashion like Vanessa wears.

464
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Wear skinny jeans.

465
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Okay.

466
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Viewing media from the 2010s.

467
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Okay, here we go.

468
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
And this is what really fucking takes me back.

469
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Listen to songs from the early 2010s.

470
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
The early 2010s were the start of modern pop songs.

471
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
What?

472
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
What?

473
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
What?

474
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
The start of modern pop songs was the early 2010s.

475
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Pop, hip hop, and dance songs were the most popular

476
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
in the 2010s.

477
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
If you were a teen or young adult in the years 2010 to 2014,

478
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
you probably listened to these trendy songs.

479
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Plenty of these songs were popular with teens in the 2010s.

480
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Many 2010s songs were about empowerment anchors.

481
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Get you the damn songs.

482
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
You said the same sentence eight times.

483
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Just the way you are, Bruno Mars.

484
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
So empowering.

485
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
July 2010, Teenage Dream, Katy Perry, July 2010,

486
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Rolling in the Deep, Adele.

487
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Hey, 2010 was a pretty good year musically.

488
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I don't know.

489
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Teenage Dream creeps me out.

490
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
2011, we got Born This Way.

491
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
We got Super Bass.

492
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
That song is Super Bass.

493
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Don't get me started.

494
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Super Bass, an 11-year-old song.

495
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Gangnam Style, we've been doing for, as of last month,

496
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
one decade.

497
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Yeah, that song rules.

498
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Roar by Katy Perry, Wrecking Ball, Happy, all dropped in 2013.

499
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Here's what's wild.

500
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Can I tell you something?

501
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Two of those, Roar and Wrecking Ball, constitute, I would say,

502
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
two of Bebe's top five favorite songs on Earth.

503
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
She is an old soul.

504
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I went, Sydney was in Africa when Gangnam Style happened.

505
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
And so I got this great delight of like, she comes off the plane

506
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
and she's about, she goes to hug me.

507
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
And I'm like, wait, no.

508
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
And I just hold up my phone in front of her like, watch this.

509
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
This is everywhere.

510
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
We're all obsessed.

511
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,600
And then, next step, listen to songs from the late 2010s.

512
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
And folks, these are going to take you right back.

513
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
To three years ago.

514
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm talking about Baby Shark by Pink Floyd.

515
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Ever heard of a little golden oldie called Despacito?

516
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, okay.

517
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Do you know that one?

518
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Do you know Bad Guy by Billie Eilish?

519
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm going to have to dust off these albums.

520
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
And at this point, I'm too afraid to tell people that.

521
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Despacito?

522
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
No, I just heard Bad Guy for the first time

523
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
in the Sam Rockwell animated picture, Bad Guys.

524
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I heard this song.

525
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Great flick, by the way.

526
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
A lot of fun, that flick.

527
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I had a great time.

528
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Yeah, that was the place I heard the song Bad Guy

529
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
by Billie Eilish.

530
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Haven't really searched it out before then,

531
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
and then I heard it and I was like, it's pretty good.

532
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I get it.

533
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Hey, let's talk about some nostalgic 2010s kids cartoons.

534
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
If you're a member of Generation Z, which I-

535
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Am I?

536
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm not, right?

537
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
People born from 1997 to 2012.

538
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
So I'm like, I'm like a rising Gen Z.

539
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Yeah, like so close.

540
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
You're on that 10 year bubble.

541
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm on the bubble of it.

542
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Specifically, younger Gen Z members, 2006 to 2012.

543
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay, that is significantly younger than I am.

544
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
You can watch these childhood cartoons

545
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
to experience your 2010s childhood again.

546
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Now, hold on a second.

547
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I have umbrage with the very first one on here.

548
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
It's Arthur.

549
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
What?

550
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Arthur's, I claim Arthur.

551
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Arthur's been running for 73 years.

552
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
So old, yeah.

553
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Arthur's been running from 1996 until still, now.

554
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
God, Arthur, they are squeezing so much.

555
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,600
They have wrung that sweet anteater family dry, huh?

556
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
That episode where they wrung them dry

557
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
is one of my favorites, actually.

558
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
It really hits.

559
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,600
So we got Adventure Time, Jake and the Neverland Pirates,

560
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Amazing World of Gumball, Wild Kratts, Gravity Falls,

561
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Steven Universe.

562
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,600
A lot of really like retro shit is on here.

563
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
We Bare Bears, The Loud House,

564
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The Magic School Bus Rides Again.

565
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Really old school, man.

566
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
And then we can go back with some 2010s kids movies

567
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,600
like Frozen or Moana or Coco or Toy Story 4,

568
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
which is three years old,

569
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
and really hop in the time whip

570
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
and let's go watch Toy Story 4

571
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
and remember a simpler time.

572
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Once again, Toy Story 4 was like the fourth movie

573
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I took BB to see in theaters.

574
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Not the best way to introduce a child

575
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
to the Toy Story franchise.

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Not kind of wrapping it up there at the end.

577
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Not that one that's mostly about retirement.

578
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I got a fun game that I bet you Justin

579
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
is going to absolutely crush

580
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
because the next one is Take Out Your 2010s Toys.

581
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I'm going to read a few of them,

582
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
but I'm going to add a fake one in there

583
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,600
and we'll see if you can pick out which one is the fake one.

584
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Juju Pets, Zoobles, Don't Laugh,

585
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
because this is someone's childhood.

586
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Juju Pets, Zoobles,

587
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Squinkies, Scramblers, Shopkins,

588
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Hatchimals, Squishmallows.

589
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I only know the last three are real.

590
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I have no idea about the first four.

591
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Yeah, I don't know the other ones.

592
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
The last three I knew, but I don't know the other ones.

593
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Juju Pets, Zoobles,

594
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Squinkies, Scramblers,

595
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I think Squinkies is fake.

596
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
I would say Scramblers is fake if we're guessing.

597
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Scramblers is fake.

598
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Well done Justin.

599
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Fuck man.

600
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
I knew of every one of you.

601
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Squinkies.

602
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Hop in the...

603
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Man, really hang up the trappings of modern life

604
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
as you play video games from the 2010s.

605
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Oh boy.

606
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm talking about Destiny.

607
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm talking about Fortnite.

608
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm talking about The Legend of Zelda,

609
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Breath of the Wild,

610
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

611
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm talking about Minecraft back in my day.

612
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I played Minecraft this morning with my son.

613
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
And use 2010s video game consoles when you do it.

614
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Of course, I'm talking about PlayStation 4,

615
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Xbox One, Nintendo Switch.

616
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
You gotta emulate it on your computers.

617
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm gonna end the media part of this now,

618
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
but I am gonna jump to use 2010s slang.

619
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Each decade has its special phrases in slang.

620
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
The 2010s was no different.

621
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
And this will be, I think, for a lot of us,

622
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,600
a sort of Oscars ceremony in memoriam

623
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
as we realize that we need to raise these terms

624
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
up into the rafters where they will stay

625
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,600
to bring us great shame for the rest of our days.

626
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Humblebrag is one of them.

627
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
And on fire.

628
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Amazing or awesome.

629
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
That's like, it'd be a jam.

630
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Like, come on.

631
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Yeah, I don't think that's...

632
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
You guys didn't have that one?

633
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeet.

634
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I'm fine with that one going away.

635
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Although, I will say, if it sticks around long enough,

636
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
it's gonna become a crosswords answer,

637
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
and I think that would be really useful,

638
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
because that double e.

639
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Yeah.

640
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I do get a kick out of my kid using it in commonplace ways.

641
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
It's good, yes.

642
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
She asked me to give her a towel,

643
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
and I threw one to her, and it landed on the floor,

644
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
and she said, Christ, you just yeeted it right off.

645
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeah, I've heard Henry use it,

646
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
and ironically, I love when Henry does it.

647
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Henry will pick up a toy and say, I'm gonna yeet this over there.

648
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I love it.

649
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
And then there's 2010's trends, which, I mean,

650
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
what's wild is that Harlem Shake is on here,

651
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,600
which does feel like it is about 60 years old,

652
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
but then also, um, flossing.

653
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
And it's like, I'm not...

654
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
That's eternal.

655
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I feel like people are still learning how to floss.

656
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
So, like, I'm not ready to hand out...

657
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I feel like some of everyone knows how to do it.

658
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
It's not fair to, like, retire it.

659
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,600
I feel like some of these are, like, when someone says...

660
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,600
It's like somebody said, did you know we're actually closer

661
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
to the time when people started doing the Harlem Shake

662
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
than we are to the birth of Cleopatra?

663
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
And you're like, what? No way!

664
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Whoa, no way, but then you look it up, and it's like, it's right.

665
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Wow.

666
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Because she was born in 1971.

667
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Yeah.

668
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
A different Cleopatra.

669
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Listen, things are...

670
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
It's a complicated time for us,

671
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,600
and I like to go back to when things were streamlined,

672
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
simple, black and white.

673
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,600
You knew when you woke up in the morning

674
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
exactly what you were in for for the day.

675
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I mean, I'll say, in 2010,

676
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I was 25 years old, and now I'm 38.

677
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
And it's worse. It's worse now.

678
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,600
You know, like, if I could go back in time to 2010

679
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
to be 25, I would do it, you know?

680
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Yeah, one of my favorite trends was waking up in the morning

681
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
and being able to get out of bed within a minute.

682
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Yeah, right, right, right.

683
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I remember when it wasn't...

684
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Like, I'd hit two o'clock,

685
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
and I didn't have to diagnose everything I'd done

686
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
for the first eight hours of the day

687
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
to see if that's why I felt like shit.

688
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
You know what I mean? I remember that.

689
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
That was my favorite trend.

690
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Body experiences, you had to see what ruined you.

691
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Was it because I had cereal instead of real food?

692
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Like, what's wrong with me?

693
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Was it too much coffee, not enough coffee?

694
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Why do I feel like shit?

695
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Another question or a break?

696
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Where are we at? How are we doing?

697
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Let's go on break. Let's take a quick break.

698
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
We've worked so hard.

699
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
We've earned it.

700
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:32,600
It's better, it's better with you.

701
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Hey, Justin.

702
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

703
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
What are you talking about?

704
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I don't understand you.

705
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

706
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Yeah, thousands of years ago, humans built a tower.

707
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Too tall.

708
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Too tall.

709
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
God didn't like it.

710
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
They made it too tall.

711
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
God didn't like it.

712
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
But now, guess what?

713
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
We popped up through the clouds on our very tall tower,

714
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
and God was like, what are you guys doing?

715
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Whoa, Jack.

716
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
You shouldn't be up there.

717
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Get off that beanstalk.

718
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Get the fuck out of here, dude.

719
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
This is actually what happened.

720
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Okay, yeah, come on.

721
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Listen, we all built a big tower.

722
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Sure.

723
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
God was like, don't do that.

724
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Don't do that, guys.

725
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
That's too tall.

726
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm up here.

727
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
You're getting into my personal space.

728
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Please don't build a tower.

729
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
You know what?

730
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
I don't want you all to ever work together again.

731
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm going to tell everybody to speak different languages.

732
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Now you can't communicate.

733
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Everybody go away.

734
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Makes complete sense.

735
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Babel is an app and software platform and service

736
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,600
that stands in defiance of the Christian God.

737
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,600
And that was when I knew we would have to do a refund on this.

738
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Babel, they call it Babel because it was the Tower of Babel

739
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
that God did to the different languages,

740
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
and now Babel stands in defiance of the Christian God,

741
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,600
giving you these precious gems that our Lord and Savior Jesus

742
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
keeps from us to keep us fighting.

743
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
You know, is it possible, Justin, that God got frustrated

744
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
with the big tall tower and he was like,

745
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
I'll speak different languages.

746
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
And then like a couple years later, he was like, I regret that.

747
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I acted.

748
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I was angry.

749
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I hadn't had my coffee.

750
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Babel stands in defiance of the Christian God

751
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
by teaching you the language that you need.

752
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
In just 10 minutes, you can complete a lesson

753
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
and thwart the omnipotent beings' designs.

754
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
And you can start having real-life conversations

755
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
in a new language in as little as three weeks.

756
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Other language learning apps for AI use their lesson plans,

757
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,600
but Babel lessons were created by over 150 language experts

758
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,600
who have damned themselves to eternal hell.

759
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Other language apps fear God, but not Babel.

760
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Other language apps fear God.

761
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Babel stands in defiance.

762
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Babel laughs in the face of eternal damnation.

763
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Why do some people skip ads?

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600

for up to 60% off your subscription.

768
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Babel, language for life.

769
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Hey, listen, this is the new bar, okay?

770
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
2022, I'm sorry, advertisers, we're getting weirder.

771
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
And you can start backing down.

772
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
You can call our bluff if you want to,

773
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
but I'm going to get aggressively weird in this year.

774
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm gonna go further and say the new bar is

775
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
we're only gonna accept advertising

776
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,600
from companies that spit in the eye of God.

777
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Unless you act in defiance,

778
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
and it doesn't have to be a Christian God,

779
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
whatever you wanna do,

780
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
as long as it challenges some kind of all-powerful being.

781
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
No, Christian God is the power of babel stunt.

782
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Other gods may be fine with it, I don't know.

783
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Maybe there were other gods who were like,

784
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
man, cool tower, dudes.

785
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Guys, I love that tower.

786
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
And here comes God, like an angry five-year-old

787
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
knocking over my blogs.

788
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Now you say, hola, and you say hello.

789
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Aw, dang, thanks, God, for nothing.

790
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Anyway, what else we got going on?

791
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Somebody else do this next one.

792
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Just get lunch.

793
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Yeah, hey, I wanna talk about Stitch Fix.

794
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
You know how God said, like, you all have to be naked now?

795
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

796
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
You need your own thing.

797
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Well, God said you had to be naked.

798
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
No, no, no, yours is good, actually.

799
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Go ahead.

800
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
We all ate the apple, and God was like,

801
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
well, now nudity's bad, and you feel nudity,

802
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
and you're aware of how nude you are.

803
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
And Stitch Fix said, fuck that.

804
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Here's some cool clothes, my dudes.

805
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
And so now we can put on clothes in defiance of God,

806
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
not be afraid of our nudity anymore,

807
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
and be proud, proud of the clothes

808
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
that we cover our human forms with.

809
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Take that, God.

810
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
So whatever your style, now more than ever,

811
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
it's time to rock it.

812
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
First, take a few minutes to set up

813
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
your Stitch Fix style profile.

814
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Answer a few questions, smile at your defiance,

815
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
and what you don't wanna wear, they won't give you.

816
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
It's great.

817
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Can I tell you what I like about Stitch Fix?

818
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Sure.

819
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I just did this today.

820
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Yeah.

821
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Stitch Fix has introduced me to, like,

822
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
brands of clothing that look good on my body.

823
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Oh, yeah.

824
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
And so I still do the Stitch Fix,

825
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,600
but when I need to, like, re-up my t-shirt collection,

826
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,600
then I have this, like, catalog of clothing brands

827
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
that I know that I like and look good in.

828
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,600
That's a valuable service they provide.

829
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Most of my clothes are Stitch Fix.

830
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Yeah, 100% at this point.

831
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Come on.

832
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
So check it out.

833
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Stitch Fix will send you five pieces to try on at home.

834
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
You keep what you love, you send back what you don't.

843

You're all grown up now,

844
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
a professional adult with diverse interests and hobbies,

845
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
and one of those hobbies is video games.

846
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
You just can't help it.

847
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
They're so good now.

848
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
If that's you, we're here to tell you,

849
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
you are completely normal.

850
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm Maddie Myers.

851
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm Jason Schreier.

852
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
And I'm Kirk Hamilton,

853
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
and together we form TripleClick,

854
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
a podcast about video games.

855
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
If you think you might be a person who likes video games,

856
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
we hope you'll give TripleClick a listen.

857
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
TripleClick, new episodes every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

858
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Hey kid, your dad tell you about the time

859
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,600
he broke Stephen Dorff's nose at the Kid's Choice Awards?

860
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,600
In dead pilot society, scripts that were developed

861
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
by studios and networks but were never produced

862
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
are given the table reads they deserve.

863
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
When I was a kid, I had to spend my Christmas break

864
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
filming a PSA about angel dust.

865
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
So yeah, being a kid sucks sometimes.

866
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
But now that I'm an adult,

867
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I can do whatever I want.

868
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
So yeah, being a kid sucks sometimes.

869
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker.

870
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Dead Pilot Society, twice a month on MaximumFun.org.

871
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
You know, the show you like.

872
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
That hobo with the scarf who lives in a magic dumpster.

873
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Doctor Who.

874
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
My roommate went to cut off a slice of their baguette

875
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
as a snack and found out their baguette had gone stale.

876
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh man, the worst.

877
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
After wielding it like a sword for a hot second, you must,

878
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
the next thing they wanted to do was see what happened

879
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
if they threw the baguette against a tree in our backyard

880
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
to see if it would explode or make a cool noise or something.

881
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
They went outside and successfully threw the baguette

882
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
against a tree but unfortunately bounced off the tree

883
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
over our fence and into the neighbor's yard.

884
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I'm really glad that you included successfully in there

885
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
because my assumption would have been you missed the tree.

886
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
But I like that you were like, listen, they hit the tree.

887
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
That's not.

888
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
No question.

889
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
And the noise was amazing.

890
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Brothers, do we have to go retrieve this baguette?

891
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
And if so, how do we do this

892
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
without ruining our relationship with our neighbor?

893
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
For context, he's a very scary old man

894
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
who already doesn't like us very much

895
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
and we're worried he might have seen the baguette toss.

896
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
That's from Breaking Bread

897
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
and entering in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

898
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Oh, wait, we have another quick.

899
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Can I read the next question?

900
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Yeah.

901
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Because it says, dear brothers, I am an old man

902
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
and a lot of people think that I have a scary demeanor.

903
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,600
But really, the way I react to people

904
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
is based entirely off of their actions towards me

905
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
and my property.

906
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Anyway, our neighbor-

907
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
For instance, if someone were to say,

908
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
throws a baguette into my backyard-

909
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,600
My sick wife woke up to the sound of a loud thunk

910
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
and she got scared.

911
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,600
She's been dealing with a severe bout of gluten intolerance.

912
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
So you can imagine my frustration.

913
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
My neighbors, who are bad people

914
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,600
because of the food issues that they bring to the world,

915
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
they did throw a bread at a tree.

916
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
And I don't know-

917
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
And listen, they hid the tree successfully.

918
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Don't get it twisted.

919
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
And I will say this-

920
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
And the sound was-

921
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
The sound was wonderful.

922
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Okay, you guys think of more jokes.

923
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
I'm gonna take everybody to the dad zone for a second

924
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
because I haven't been a dad the longest.

925
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Don't do this with a baguette.

926
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
A stale baguette, that's beautiful.

927
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I like more things made from stale bread

928
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
than I do things made from fresh bread.

929
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Here's what you should do next time.

930
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Cut it into cubes, melt some butter,

931
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
but mix it up with some seasoning salt,

932
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
some different spices.

933
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You toast that.

934
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Oh, that's a crouton, baby.

935
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Maybe you-

936
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
You know what?

937
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Maybe on top of a nice French onion, too.

938
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh yeah, baby.

939
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Oh, really good breadcrumbs.

940
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Have you heard of these things?

941
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
They go on lots of great stuff.

942
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Breadcrumbs, grind it up.

943
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
This is-

944
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Breadcrumbs, grind it up.

945
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
That's the-

946
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Don't waste stale bread.

947
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
There's lots of great stuff to do with stale bread.

948
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Okay, now back to toast.

949
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
French toast.

950
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Oh, French toast made with stale bread is the best.

951
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Have I ever told you guys

952
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
about the best French toast on earth?

953
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,600
You use Panettone, the Christmas cake.

954
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Oh my God, that's good.

955
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Oh, fuck yeah, it's amazing.

956
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
God, that's good.

957
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
That says holiday to me right there.

958
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
It's so good, dude.

959
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
That's taken me to brunch.

960
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
That's taken me to brunch with my family.

961
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
And who's that?

962
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
All my favorite celebrities, they're there, too.

963
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
This is a wonderful brunch.

964
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Michael Keaton?

965
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah, I made this for you.

966
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Whoa.

967
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Now, here's the thing that I, and listen,

968
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm not always the best at reading these.

969
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
And so you guys tell me if I'm reading the situation wrong,

970
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
but I look at this as either,

971
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
either this old neighbor saw the bread throw

972
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,600
and knows you're responsible for it, right?

973
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Or they don't.

974
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
And if they already know you're responsible for it,

975
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
what are you gonna do?

976
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Go over and say, hey, we need our old bread back, right?

977
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,600
And if they don't know you're responsible for it,

978
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
why out yourself?

979
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
I don't know that your neighbor is going to need

980
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
the fucking CSI ballistics team to come out

981
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
and track the origin of this baguette.

982
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
There's one dumb shit that lives next to me.

983
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
I have a baguette in my backyard.

984
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
They've solved the crime.

985
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
No, no, no, I would say between those two things,

986
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,600
there are wavy equal signs of like, I'm pretty sure, right?

987
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
But oh, the difference, oh, the difference

988
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
between the wavy equal sign and the solid equal sign,

989
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
my friend, I'm pretty sure that baguette came over from there

990
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,600
versus, hey, my actions resulted in that baguette

991
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,600
coming over there, no question.

992
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Guys, I have a great idea.

993
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
This is really, actually really good.

994
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Get three baguettes.

995
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Oh, wow, and put them in your backyard

996
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
and then go over and knock on your neighbor's door

997
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
and then just be like, you see this?

998
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
What has happened to this neighborhood?

999
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
What's going on?

1000
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Did they get you two?

1001
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
It's a bonding thing now.

1002
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
And then you're like, oh, they got you two.

1003
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I'm sorry.

1004
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
What has happened to this neighborhood

1005
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
where kids are just throwing baguettes into people's yards?

1006
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Now, Justin, I thought you were going to say,

1007
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
this is how we get ants.

1008
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
And you talk about getting ants.

1009
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
That's going to get all people fired up.

1011
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
They hate those little guys.

1012
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Get three other baguettes, like Justin said.

1013
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Carry them with you over there and say,

1014
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
hey, juggling accident, I need that back.

1015
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
And he's like, what?

1016
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I'm practicing juggling baguettes for my new act.

1017
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
And then your neighbor's going to be like, I like that.

1018
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Yeah.

1019
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
I like that and you.

1020
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Thanks for doing that near my home.

1021
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Well, if there's one thing your elderly neighbor's

1022
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
going to understand is the need to practice

1023
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
to get better at something, right?

1024
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
He's been around the block.

1025
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
He knows.

1026
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
And the best part of this is if he's like,

1027
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
oh, show me the juggling.

1028
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,600
You can say, well, clearly I'm not very good at it yet.

1029
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm not ready.

1030
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,600
If one of the baguettes made it all the way over here,

1031
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
oh, my man, I still have work to do.

1032
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,600
You could also just get one baguette if you're on a budget

1033
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,600
and then lay down on the sidewalk in front of his house

1034
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
and put the baguette near your head

1035
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
and then pretend to be unconscious.

1036
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
And then when the neighbor comes out and finds you,

1037
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
nurses you back to health, and you'd be like,

1038
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
oh, bread boy got me.

1039
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, then you're like, I think the paper boy

1040
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
has turned a corner.

1041
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't know what he's doing anymore.

1042
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I don't know what his whole deal is.

1043
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
He used to deliver papers.

1044
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Now it's mostly bread.

1045
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Do you have a Munch Squad, Justin?

1046
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Because there's something.

1047
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Yeah, OK.

1048
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
What?

1049
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
No, what were you going to say?

1050
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,600
There's just, I saw something in the tip line

1051
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
that felt very Munch Squad worthy,

1052
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
and I didn't know if you were going to bring it or not.

1053
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
On the tip line?

1054
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
We have a tip line?

1055
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
We have an email address?

1056
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Yeah, on the hot line,

1057
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,600
on the Bim Bam Munch Squad hot line.

1058
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
On the Newswire?

1059
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
You know.

1060
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
The Munch Squad AP Newswire.

1061
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Oh, coming across the Newswire.

1062
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah.

1063
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Yeah.

1064
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I will go ahead and I will mention this briefly.

1065
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
This is not a Munch Squad.

1066
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm experiencing this as you are.

1067
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Folks, this is just coming to my desk.

1068
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I've just been handed this.

1069
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I have something else to talk about.

1070
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Sorry, this has just come in.

1071
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
You're on video.

1072
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
I'm just holding up a picture of a flower my kid drew.

1073
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Wait, which one drew that?

1074
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Show me that.

1075
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
That's really good.

1076
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Yeah, show me.

1077
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
That's a really good picture.

1078
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Wow.

1079
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
That's top-notch detail.

1080
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Who drew that?

1081
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Was that Cooper or Charlie?

1082
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
It's Charlie.

1083
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
It's a flower style.

1084
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It's a flower style?

1085
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
This is like her flower style.

1086
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I love it.

1087
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
It's like Iris.

1088
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Anyway.

1089
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I was recording audio for Cartoon Name Redacted, and she sat across from me and did some art.

1090
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
This doesn't matter.

1091
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Tony the Tiger is going to be a VTuber.

1092
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
What?

1093
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
No one says that.

1094
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Do people say that?

1095
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Yeah.

1096
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
VTuber?

1097
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
People still say that.

1098
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Yeah, VTuber.

1099
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Sorry, Grandpa.

1100
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
It's pronounced VTuber.

1101
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
VTuber.

1102
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
VTuber.

1103
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Is that a vampire YouTuber?

1104
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Yes.

1105
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:26,640
Calyx and Scott Tony the Tiger will become an interactive virtual YouTuber, or VTuber.

1106
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,760
The first show will air on Friday, August 19th from 5 to 7 ET as Tony the Tiger takes

1107
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,080
on well-known streamers and competes on Twitch.

1108
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,160
He's going up against, these names mean nothing to me, and it says they're going to be playing

1109
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,600
a popular battle royale game, so I guess that biz-den deal hasn't closed yet.

1110
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Not quite.

1111
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,660
They are bringing it down to the wire.

1112
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,360
I am going to watch this tiger be like, I'm Goku now.

1113
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,080
Suck my Dragon Balls.

1114
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,140
I hope Tony the Tiger kicks their asses, right?

1115
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,280
There's nothing better to me than this idea of, well, originally this was supposed to

1116
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,120
be a one-off thing, but then we couldn't stop because Tony was undefeated.

1117
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,980
Tony the Tiger just won $1.2 million in a video game championship.

1118
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,100
We don't know what to do.

1119
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,220
He's not real.

1120
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,520
He doesn't work for Frosted Flakes anymore.

1121
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,040
Yeah, the box is empty.

1122
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,720
It just says flakes.

1123
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,120
It's a plain blue box that says flakes on it.

1124
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,040
He took the frosting with him when he left.

1125
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,200
He owned the frosting.

1126
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,660
We didn't even know his contract is so old.

1127
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,780
He owned the frosting.

1128
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,040
No one knew.

1129
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
This innovative concept.

1130
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,320
He made the frosting himself.

1131
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,760
He exuded it from his pores.

1132
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,880
This innovative concept taps into the growing popularity of VTubing on Twitch, where we saw

1133
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,680
VTubing content increase 467% year over year last year, explained Adam Harris, the global

1134
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,920
head of Twitch's brand partnership studio.

1135
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,480
Together with Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, we're producing a made-for-the-Twitch community

1136
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,480
live experience that introduces a beloved character to well-known Twitch streamers, fosters

1137
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,680
a healthy dose of competition, and encourages viewers to interact with Tony the Tiger in

1138
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,080
real-time chat.

1139
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,920
He doesn't say this, but I'm going to assume it's just implied, inviting some various

1140
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,680
corners of the internet to come and get so horny that you will not believe it.

1141
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,160
The mod team must be extensive.

1142
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,600
How refreshing it will be for the internet to see a virtual Tony the Tiger where he does

1143
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,440
not have just the biggest hog just out.

1144
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
You assume.

1145
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,520
Well, yeah, I guess I've not looked at much erotic Tony the Tiger.

1146
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
No, I'm sorry.

1147
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,160
Why don't you assume that during this Frosted Flakes sponsored stream, Tony the Tiger wouldn't

1148
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
have his hog out.

1149
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Oh, fair.

1150
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Yeah.

1151
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,680
Now, well, it is virtual, right?

1152
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:53,520
So someone would have to go deep into the option, some deep hot bars on Blender to really

1153
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,760
whip up this Tiger hog.

1154
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,320
Now I also want to say, the reason I love this so much is to talk about the 2010s.

1155
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,360
For a long time there, Tony's whole deal was like, get out there and play some sports.

1156
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,280
Let's do soccer and basketball.

1157
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
You're great.

1158
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,880
We are the mighty, mighty Tigers.

1159
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,320
And now he's like, this chair is pretty comfortable.

1160
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm just going to stay here and enjoy some Baja Blast for a while.

1161
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,400
At the behest of this MBM listener that sent this question in, I ducked into Tumblr just

1162
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,360
to see how it's going over there.

1163
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,160
There's a lot of like, it's my time to shine, yes, yes.

1164
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,200
We have to tell the furries, yes.

1165
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,760
Post entire pages of Tony X Grinch fanfic in the chat.

1166
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
Yes.

1167
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Let's go.

1168
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
Yes.

1169
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Yes.

1170
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,960
We need to bring that you can give me a yogurt enema anytime, Tony energy.

1171
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Whoa.

1172
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Yeah.

1173
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,320
You can Frost my Flake, Tony.

1174
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Thank you.

1175
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
There's so much.

1176
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:04,080
Enema is like a Victorian era cure for wanting to masturbate, in case anyone's wondering.

1177
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,440
We just talked about it on Schmaners this week.

1178
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,000
Duh, everyone knows that.

1179
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Do they?

1180
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,280
There's so much of the internet.

1181
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,080
And I like that.

1182
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,960
There's so much of it.

1183
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh yeah.

1184
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,520
Anything you could want, it's always there.

1185
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,280
And I'm grateful for this, Tony.

1186
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,800
This is a question about the picture.

1187
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,640
Where the fuck are his ears?

1188
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,900
Tiger ears are big.

1189
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,200
Those headphones would not cover them.

1190
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
That's a good point.

1191
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Thank you.

1192
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
You know what?

1193
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
I think I can, hold on.

1194
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,080
I think I can add a image, if y'all would like to see.

1195
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,400
Yes, please.

1196
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,720
Are you going to drop the, it's important for me to know which channel you're going

1197
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
to put this in.

1198
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Yeah, live life, love people.

1199
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,200
I don't want it to be our public company chat, because that will raise-

1200
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,200
No, I'm going to put it into this, into this, into this.

1201
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,680
Oh boy.

1202
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,920
Yeah, there he is.

1203
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,360
When you said you were about to drop a pic, you told us that you were on the deep web,

1204
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
and that you found a Tony the Tiger picture.

1205
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
No, no, no.

1206
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,540
This is just a picture of the thing.

1207
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,680
I just want to say, man, it's a good setup, Tony.

1208
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,160
It's a good streamer setup.

1209
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,440
His PC is, I don't know if you guys noticed this, his PC is milk cooled.

1210
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
That's so cool.

1211
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
That's fucking funny.

1212
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
That's so cool.

1213
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,600
Now, I will say, not a great microphone, Tony.

1214
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
You could do better.

1215
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,600
Yeah, do better, Tony.

1216
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
You got a lot of money.

1217
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

1218
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I wanted...

1219
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,460
I want a Munch squad.

1220
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,560
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, I want to Munch squad.

1221
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,680
Squad.

1222
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,460
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1223
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,000
Welcome to Munch squad, it's a podcast within a podcast profiling the latest in brain eating.

1224
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,680
I know we've been doing it for a little while, but-

1225
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,280
This feels like Munch fraud.

1226
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,800
No, I didn't do the intro, so it was irritating me.

1227
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,840
I wanted to announce the video very quickly.

1228
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Very quickly about this, KFC Thailand

1229
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,080
is introducing a modernist Mother's Day gift idea,

1230
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,960
the KFC Chicken Pop Garland,

1231
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,220
celebrating National Mother's Day with a twist.

1232
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,060
No.

1233
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,900
Cool.

1234
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,680
All right, y'all.

1235
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,840
Normally I would build to the picture of it,

1236
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,840
but I'm just gonna show you the picture, okay?

1237
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,880
Here we go.

1238
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,040
Okay, so this is the KFC Pop Garland, huh?

1239
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,320
I like this.

1240
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,440
Just for the record, I wanna go on record and say

1241
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,720
before I know anything else about it that I do like it.

1242
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,960
What is it?

1243
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,760
KFC Thailand is helping you celebrate like never before

1244
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,200
introducing our Mother's Day gift idea,

1245
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,040
KFC Chicken Pop Garland.

1246
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,000
The Colonel's crispy edible blooms

1247
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,320
were crafted in partnership with HeartMade,

1248
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,640
one of the most coveted floral studios.

1249
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
This unique creation combines

1250
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,920
the assortment of mom's beloved items,

1251
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,680
like her favorite menu, KFC Chicken Pop,

1252
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,760
flowers and veggies she cooks for the family.

1253
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,680
Everyone can create their own unique

1254
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,320
HeartMade Chicken Pop Garland for mom.

1255
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,160
Well, that's nice.

1256
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,920
First of all, the customization is nice.

1257
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,760
I appreciate it.

1258
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,800
I guess I don't know what a garland is.

1259
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Yeah, it's fascinating.

1260
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,600
I think we're up against,

1261
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,080
I mean, I know what a garland is here

1262
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,920
and how we would use that,

1263
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,360
but I think we're up against,

1264
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,600
it's interesting to see the sort of like cultural,

1265
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,600
like I wanna say ruining,

1266
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,760
like ruining cultures that I don't even,

1267
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,920
I haven't even gotten a chance to understand

1268
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,600
what this actually is before KFC has gotten to it

1269
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,960
and kind of ruined it.

1270
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,600
Because to me, this picture looks like a tiny wreath

1271
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,440
or maybe something I would put on a doorknob.

1272
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
Looks like a tiny wreath of chicken,

1273
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,760
of popcorn chicken.

1274
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,720
I mean, a garland can be a wreath.

1275
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
Now, can I also tell you guys what's fucking with me?

1276
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,600
Yeah.

1277
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,880
How is it held together that I can still eat it, right?

1278
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,040
Barbed wire, weirdly, sharing the aromatic,

1279
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,480
crispy, juicy fried chicken ensures quality family time

1280
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,000
and the scrumptious bites just speak louder than words.

1281
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,480
Is it like a candy necklace kind of thing?

1282
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,120
That is what it seems.

1283
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,280
You'll get to reminisce about the school days

1284
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,360
when you get to craft your own gift for mom.

1285
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,680
Most importantly, do not drool over the garland.

1286
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,320
Just hashtag save chicken pop for mom.

1287
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,960
Let her enjoy the moment

1288
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,520
with the scrumptious heart made treat.

1289
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,720
You know what I love about that?

1290
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,120
That's a hashtag that applies

1291
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,680
to so many different situations.

1292
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,680
That's gonna catch on outside of this, you know what I mean?

1293
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,520
That's gonna be the new hashtag blessed.

1294
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,560
I'm looking at this

1295
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,640
and I do want a ring-shaped fried chicken experience.

1296
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,200
It seems like it would be easy to take on the go.

1297
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,840
Yeah, you could have one in each hand

1298
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,600
like you're fucking in Tron or something.

1299
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,440
I like that.

1300
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,280
Like a bracelet.

1301
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,120
Yeah, man.

1302
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,200
Yeah, we're several like a bracelet.

1303
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,280
The garland tutorial and giveaway activity

1304
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,720
are on Facebook and TikTok live.

1305
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,560
Wait.

1306
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,560
No, by Up Poompat Lam Samang.

1307
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,520
A famous Thai young actor is the one doing it.

1308
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,640
Now, if you look, I wanna show you a picture of this cat

1309
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,240
and tell me if you think that the crafts

1310
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,640
that this person is able to do,

1311
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,200
you would be able to replicate it anyway.

1312
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,040
No.

1313
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
Like they look so much more capable than me.

1314
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,880
No, absolutely not.

1315
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,560
Absolutely beautiful.

1316
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,640
I would never be able to keep up with that person.

1317
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,520
They'd be like, nugget, nugget, nugget, nugget.

1318
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,920
Like, wait, slow down, please.

1319
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,040
It also occurs to me, is this a full DIY?

1320
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,000
So this isn't like-

1321
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,840
Yes.

1322
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,960
I think you are getting the components for this.

1323
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,440
It's not clear in the thing,

1324
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,480
but I think you're getting the components for this,

1325
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,160
which is the popcorn chicken.

1326
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,960
Well, I think all you're getting is the popcorn chicken.

1327
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,800
Right.

1328
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,640
I think they're just selling,

1329
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,800
what they're saying is, here's chicken.

1330
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,160
Here's some chicken.

1331
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,000
Do what thou wilt.

1332
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,840
Because here's the thing,

1333
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,840
they can't sell you a chicken bracelet.

1334
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,680
No.

1335
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,520
Like legally, they can't sell you a chicken bracelet.

1336
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,360
No, they can't.

1337
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,200
Because you're going to chomp into that

1338
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,240
and get the wire or twine or thread or whatever.

1339
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,760
Best case scenario.

1340
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,360
That's best case scenario

1341
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
that is holding that ring together.

1342
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,560
And that's just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

1343
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,720
It's not even waiting.

1344
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,240
That's just going to be a lawsuit pretty much day one.

1345
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,800
There will be a class action sort of.

1346
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,680
Yeah, I ate the thread.

1347
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,520
I ate the thread.

1348
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,460
I ate the wire.

1349
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,300
I did eat it.

1350
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,140
Sorry.

1351
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,980
I thought it was food.

1352
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,520
You can't sell it if it's not part of the thing.

1353
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,280
KFC, our relationship, historically,

1354
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,440
is that I give them money

1355
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,920
and they give me food in exchange.

1356
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,800
And I eat all of it.

1357
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,520
I eat everything they give me.

1358
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,720
I know about the bucket.

1359
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,320
Like I'm not an idiot.

1360
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,600
And I've always been up in the air about bones, frankly,

1361
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,040
because dogs eat them, right?

1362
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,880
So I don't know,

1363
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,580
but I don't think dogs are supposed to eat them, right?

1364
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,080
So isn't that, whoa.

1365
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,560
It's, I am easily tricked.

1366
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,480
Another quick question?

1367
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,320
Yeah, let's do it.

1368
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,520
Y'all, I have, y'all,

1369
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,860
my tabs right now are a blasted land.

1370
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,920
It is, it is, it is.

1371
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,320
I'm trying so desperately to find something

1372
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,760
that I recognize.

1373
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,680
It's just Tony the Tiger and chicken bracelets

1374
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,240
all the way down.

1375
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,320
Read that last question there, Jamie.

1376
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,400
Okay.

1377
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,880
I ride a very distinct e-bike for transportation and fun.

1378
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,020
I love my e-bike.

1379
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,320
However, there's a skate park on my usual route.

1380
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,240
There's often a group of teenagers that yell at me,

1381
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,500
just full on scream.

1382
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,400
One of these teenagers is my girlfriend's younger brother.

1383
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,820
He definitely knows me.

1384
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,480
I haven't told my girlfriend yet,

1385
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,320
but should I,

1386
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,480
should I tattle on him?

1387
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,040
How can I get them to stop screaming at me?

1388
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,080
That's from bothered by brother-in-law.

1389
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,120
The image of somebody just riding past a park on a bike

1390
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,120
and then just like six to 10, like teenagers just like,

1391
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,520
turning in unison,

1392
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,720
like something from American Horror Story.

1393
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,760
Just all of them,

1394
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,920
evasion of the body snatchers, just like,

1395
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,200
I think your little brother got body snatched for sure.

1396
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,040
For sure, for sure.

1397
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,640
I'm a pod person now.

1398
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,160
If the decision is let them keep screaming at me

1399
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,520
or tattle on the brother,

1400
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,720
there's a third option,

1401
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,120
which is get in that skate park

1402
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,400
and do some sick tricks on your e-bike.

1403
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,200
Those dum-dums are using probably skateboards

1404
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,200
and maybe bikes that do not have that electric power

1405
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,680
coursing through them,

1406
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,440
allowing you to do stunts,

1407
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,200
the likes of which these children could not imagine.

1408
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,800
You'll go down a half pipe and be like,

1409
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,880
he's going really slow.

1410
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,160
And then you kick on the electricity, I guess.

1411
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,080
You scream by the power of Zeus and you launch off the top.

1412
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,440
Up there and do like a 900,

1413
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,840
just like Nikolai Tesla did when he invented the e-bike.

1414
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,400
And you'll shut those kids up.

1415
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,640
Maybe they're screaming because of how awesome

1416
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,000
your electricity powered bicycle is.

1417
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,840
Did you think about that?

1418
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,680
This is what I'm saying.

1419
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,960
If they're doing this consistently,

1420
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,240
I don't think it's to fuck with you, right?

1421
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,200
They'd vary that up.

1422
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,040
If they didn't get a response the first couple of times,

1423
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,080
they'd vary it up.

1424
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,280
I think this is very much like, there he is, our hero.

1425
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,080
Our hero, the e-biker.

1426
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,440
Get in there, man.

1427
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,120
Show those kids that you can do.

1428
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,440
Now don't fuck this up.

1429
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,640
I can't stress it enough.

1430
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,480
If you do get in there and you eat it in front of them,

1431
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,280
that's going to be the rest of your life.

1432
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,920
Or maybe that's their game plan,

1433
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,360
is they shout at every non-skater who hoes by

1434
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,920
thinking that they will be threatened into coming in,

1435
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,120
and then they fall on their butt,

1436
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,480
and then the children get a good laugh.

1437
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,960
But then they're done with you.

1438
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,160
We're agreed that if this person tattles

1439
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,400
to their girlfriend on the little brother,

1440
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,280
that will be the end of their relationship

1441
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,120
as they know it, right?

1442
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,400
With the little brother or with the girlfriend or both?

1443
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,200
With the girlfriend, you can't.

1444
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,120
Like, think about the words.

1445
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,920
You gotta think about the words.

1446
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,720
Your brother has been bullying me

1447
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,520
while I tried to ride past him on my fast bike,

1448
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,560
and I slowed down long enough for him to bully me,

1449
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,400
and then I leave.

1450
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,240
What do you mean?

1451
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,120
Well, they scream at me.

1452
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,960
What do they scream?

1453
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,000
It's just noise.

1454
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,840
Okay.

1455
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,640
Some bike guy, or like, there's the bike, or Mr. Bike.

1456
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,440
So what do you want me to do about this?

1457
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,320
Tell your little brother not to bully me.

1458
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,240
Please don't.

1459
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,600
Do you need to think about,

1460
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,200
when you get in there and you land a sick trick,

1461
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,600
what is going to be your motivational statement

1462
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,960
when you land it and you come screeching up to them

1463
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,600
and gonna cure a slide or something,

1464
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,960
and then you pop up and you need to say like,

1465
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,600
don't say don't do drugs,

1466
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,640
because there are some drugs that are kind of cool.

1467
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,680
Like, you want to pop up and be like,

1468
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,320
don't fall for Ponzi schemes,

1469
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,320
or whatever your thing is gonna be that these kids are like,

1470
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,840
whoa, that was amazing.

1471
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,040
And then you're like, you know, don't forget.

1472
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,120
You tear a phone book in half.

1473
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,080
Yeah, you tear a phone,

1474
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,480
you pop up for me to cure a slide,

1475
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,680
you tear the phone book in half,

1476
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,120
and you say, make sure to invest wisely, right?

1477
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,800
Here's, do you have a Roth IRA, right?

1478
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,640
And then you pedal out of it.

1479
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,520
I can set that up for you kids right now.

1480
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,360
Right now.

1481
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,400
Who's got money?

1482
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,360
Which one of you kids have money?

1483
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,240
I don't know when the last time you all screamed was.

1484
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,320
It sucks.

1485
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,160
It hurts.

1486
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,980
What, screaming?

1487
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,320
Yeah, it sucks to scream.

1488
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,880
Well, you have to find,

1489
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,640
you have to find your natural pitch,

1490
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,480
and you have to do it with ease.

1491
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,640
Okay, but I'm talking about,

1492
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,320
if they scream at you the whole time

1493
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,440
that you're biking by them,

1494
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,800
next time, just stop and look at them.

1495
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,960
And then they will scream and scream and scream

1496
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,480
until I guess they stop because they get too tired.

1497
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,680
And then you just bike away.

1498
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,520
Nah, dude.

1499
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,480
And they'll probably not want to do it again,

1500
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,840
cause they're like, there's that guy, it's your loser

1501
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,280
brother-in-law, who we all hate so much

1502
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,760
because of how, how electric his bike is.

1503
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,580
Yeah.

1504
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,840
But I can't keep screaming at this dude.

1505
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,360
Cause I have choir practice at church tomorrow.

1506
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,600
I, like, okay, Griffin, counterpoint.

1507
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,960
I don't want escalation from screaming.

1508
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,040
There's no counterpoint.

1509
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,700
I don't want escalation from screaming.

1510
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,320
If screaming is the worst thing they're doing

1511
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,440
and it's just noise,

1512
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,680
and that's the worst thing they're doing.

1513
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,520
Oh, okay.

1514
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,580
They're going to say, I'm tired of screaming at this dude.

1515
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,640
He did stop.

1516
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,760
Let's go hurt him.

1517
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,800
Let's take his bike.

1518
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,120
Let's use this bike to charge our vapes.

1519
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,960
We'll take, we'll rip the battery from his bike,

1520
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,040
charge our vapes with it, blow our vape in his face.

1521
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,120
Plug it into our iPads so we can play more Roblox

1522
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,960
while we vape.

1523
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Roblox to each other.

1524
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,400
And then you're just going to,

1525
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,820
and can I tell you the saddest part?

1526
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,580
Then you're just going to have a bike.

1527
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,960
And you may as well just push that down

1528
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,480
the nearest storm drain.

1529
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,560
Give it right to Pennywise.

1530
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,400
Give it right to Pennywise, he'll have fun with it.

1531
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,760
You kids have a bike?

1532
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,680
Oh, I thought this was electric.

1533
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,280
This sucks ass.

1534
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,720
How fucking dope.

1535
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,040
Georgie, do you have a razor scooter?

1536
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,840
It takes so long for me to get around down here.

1537
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,840
How fucking sick would a remake of It set now be

1538
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,880
when like a kid is walking in the rain

1539
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,680
and Penny's like, hello little child.

1540
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,920
And he's like, are you?

1541
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,320
What the fuck is your deal?

1542
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,320
Like I've got Fortnite skin certificate.

1543
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,600
You can cash these in to get Bo Effect.

1544
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,120
No, he would not be that up to trends.

1545
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,680
He would be like, do you want a little boat?

1546
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,040
And he'd be like, I'm playing Subway Surfers.

1547
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,520
And you made me lose Pennywise.

1548
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,440
I'm going to come to, hey friends,

1549
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,600
what do you have in your hand?

1550
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,480
It's a cell phone.

1551
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,320
Shut up.

1552
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,140
I'm not talking to you.

1553
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,980
Friends, come out and beat this clown's ass.

1554
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,960
I've got balloons down here.

1555
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,520
Fuck, balloons?

1556
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,760
I'm 12, dude.

1557
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

1558
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,760
In the original It, it took,

1559
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,040
it took four kids to beat that clown's ass.

1560
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,520
And they were like 1970s, 80s kids.

1561
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,080
And they, they had a slingshot.

1562
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,200
I'm saying that like a kid could get,

1563
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,640
all these kids could get pepper spray

1564
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,620
at a nearby gas station and fuck this dude.

1565
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,840
That movie would be four minutes long.

1566
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,840
They hire someone on TaskRabbit to come murder him.

1567
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,960
To come murder his ass and rip him apart.

1568
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,280
Anyway, that's the.

1569
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,680
That's the story with Pennywise.

1570
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,480
That's how we're going to get Pennywise,

1571
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,040
in case y'all are wondering.

1572
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,880
That's how we're going to get him.

1573
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,320
Henry saw a video, a YouTube popped up

1574
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,120
on Henry's cursed feed and Pennywise was in it.

1575
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,400
And he's like, oh man, shit.

1576
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm afraid of this clown now.

1577
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,280
And I didn't know how to tell him like,

1578
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,120
you could, you and your preschool friends

1579
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,440
could massacre this clown.

1580
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,080
It would not even be close.

1581
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,240
He would open his mouth real wide

1582
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,600
and do his like silly dance.

1583
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,320
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1584
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,200
And then you would just like throw a tide pod in his mouth.

1585
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,280
And he would just fall over and die.

1586
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,040
I've seen some pretty cursed roadblocks, obviously.

1587
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,720
This isn't doing shit to me, dude.

1588
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,560
This is nothing.

1589
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,240
Yeah, I saw a thing where I was in a butcher's mouth

1590
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,080
for a while.

1591
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,240
I don't care about any of this, man.

1592
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,240
Thank you so much for joining us on our program.

1593
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,220
We hope you've enjoyed yourself

and hope you've had a good time.

1595
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,860
Maybe you've learned a little something.

1596
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,120
Maybe you've learned a little something about that, man.

1597
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,680
You know, I don't know, maybe.

1598
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,940
Probably not.

1599
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,080
Probably not, but maybe.

1600
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,360
Who knows?

1601
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,240
Who knows, maybe.

1602
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,980
Thank you so much for being a part of our show.

1603
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,360
Trav, you got anything to tell the people?

1604
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,200
Hell yeah, dude.

1605
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,160

when we're recording this tomorrow.

1616
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,140
So we have no idea.

1617
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,240
Maybe they're already sold out.

1618
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,080
Bummer.

1619
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,900
Sorry about that.

1620
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,740
Then we have-

1621
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,560
Sorry.

1622
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,400
I'm sorry.

1623
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,240
Sorry.

1624
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,060
I'm sorry.

1625
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:38,900
And then we've got November shows coming up-

1626
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,740

because we got a Geralt plushie that's so cute.

1641
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,000
And if God's not dead,

1642
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,320
how do you explain these game shirt

1643
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,160
that is sure to confuse your friends

1644
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,200
that don't listen to this show?

1645
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,160
It confuses me.

1646
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:18,980
Yeah. Yeah.

1647
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,560
It's designed by Lucas Hespin-Hindone.

1648
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,400
It's absolutely beautiful.

1649
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,240
You gotta check it out.

1650
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,520

01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,440
I'm on Twitch, twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

1658
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,120
I'm hoping to partner with Tony the Tiger soon.

1659
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,640
Do a couple Five Nights at Freddy's runs

1660
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,600
with Tony the Tiger.

1661
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,880
So if you can go subscribe,

1662
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,160
that will help boost my numbers

1663
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,280
so I can go and convince Tony the Tiger

1664
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,360
to play Five Nights at Freddy's with me.

1665
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,280
Thanks to Montaigne for these for our theme song,

1666
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,440
My Life Is Better With You.

1667
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,880
She has a new album coming out September 2nd

1668
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,400
called Making It.

1669
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,200
That is, it looks really dope.

1670
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,720
It's got some good songs on it.

1671
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,600
And it was just her birthday, so go get it.

1672
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,440
Go get it.

1673
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,280
Go get that album.

1674
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,760
There's the, I pre-ordered the album and shirt

1675
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,760
last night for it.

1676
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,640
It is like the wildest, the wildest design ever.

1677
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,480
I can't wait.

1678
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,640
September 2nd is when that one drops.

1679
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,920
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1680
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,640
So then what do we do now is the end of it.

1681
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,680
Cause we need to really.

1682
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,440
We've really been struggling.

1683
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,160
What if this time, okay, maybe we like harmonize

1684
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,240
on like closing time by the semi-sonics.

1685
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,560
It can't be.

1686
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,760
Can we just, and here's something I've been thinking about.

1687
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,520
We've said some really funny shit.

1688
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,560
Yeah.

1689
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,520
We've said some really funny shit so far.

1690
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,680
And I think like, I think people are gonna listen

1691
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,400
to this episode and they're gonna like it.

1692
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,660
Do we need to have, does it feel like a little,

1693
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,400
like hubris a little bit to be like,

1694
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,100
we can generate one more funny shit.

1695
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,400
Like the rest of the show, we don't sit in silence

1696
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,520
staring at each other, waiting for the funny thing

1697
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,840
to just like leap out of us spontaneously.

1698
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,740
You're saying that it should just be like,

1699
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,420
maybe we should pivot to, this is too hard.

1700
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,680
And if we have a bit at the end,

1701
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,100
that means we left something in the tank.

1702
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,360
We left something in the tank.

1703
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,880
And so two options, I guess then is the first

1704
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,080
is we just like dripping sweat.

1705
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,920
Just like, that's it folks.

1706
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,860
We tap out, we can't do any more, bye.

1707
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,860
Or if we say something like super funny during the show,

1708
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,960
we stop the show right there.

1709
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,300
And that's the end.

1710
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,400
Just go out on a high.

1711
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,120
Yeah, and I don't wanna do that

1712
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,600
because they have to be a certain length

1713
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,320
or the advertisers get even angrier at us

1714
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,200
than they are as like a baseline level.

1715
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,040
If you listen to the ads this week,

1716
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,520
it would be hard for you to imagine, but it's true.

1717
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,360
It's true.

1718
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,240
Maybe we should end with like just an inspirational quote.

1719
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,680
It's not funny.

1720
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,640
It's just like an uplifting,

1721
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,520
something to think about as we head out.

1722
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,280
So Griffin, why don't you give us an inspirational quote?

1723
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,200
Sure, tear it up.

1724
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,560
Get out there and tear it up.

1725
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,520
Find something beautiful and destroy it.

1726
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,360
This is great.

1727
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,180
I love this.

1728
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,020
This is good.

1729
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,140
Then why didn't you end the fucking show, Justin?

1730
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,280
My name is Justin McElroy.

1731
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1732
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,180
Tear down the bourgeoisie.

1733
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,160
I don't know what that word means.

1734
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,760
This has been my brother and me.

1735
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1736
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,120
Is bourgeoisie good or bad?

1737
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,120
I don't know.
