1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
If you change your mind

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Well

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,560
You did it. Yes, we're here might as well do a show my brother my brother and me episode 14

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,480
I never thought I never thought we'd make it this far never thought we'd get her that 13 home

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,880
But we did consider it helped. I guess so I'm saying

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,580
This is an advice show if you're unaware for the modern era

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,580
If you're just now joining us welcome, you can hop on right now. There's no nothing you have to know already

8
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,840
There's no continuity a room on the bandwagon Lenny a room on the bandwagon

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
I think but at this point if you're just now listening to it, you've missed

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,100
Like the getting in on the ground floor, like you can't think so

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,260
I think still I think I think first 25 episodes. You're still like in the Founders Club

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,240
Because I plan on stopping it episode

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
638

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,180
so in

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,500
So we're we're still sort of on point there as far as that goes, okay?

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,380
Well, everyone's jackets are in the mail your Founders Club Jackets Club Jackets real nice stuff

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,560
Really like really just half polyester half spider silk

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,780
It's like a polyester spider silk windbreaker and it's a blend windbreak

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,980
We're in our face spiders though. Our faces are on the elbows like patches, right?

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,340
Made a spider object. I had Travis harvest all the spider eggs. It was terrifying

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,220
They incubated in his belly and then burst forth and made jackets

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,900
Yeah, this was actually pretty nice. That was nice. He had this finally understood what motherhood is like

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Travis had an anonymous

24
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,660
Emailer on gmail. I just want to say that Travis had to swallow a jacket pattern that we bought at Michael's

25
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Anonymous emailer on gmail

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,460
Asks I received my first job out of college in March and I am still employed here

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,140
I was curious when it was appropriate to ask for a raise and how to go about doing it

28
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,800
My boss is a really nice guy

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,860
But due to my social anxiety and my lack of fully understanding the intricacies of a workplace and this workplace in particular

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,620
I'm afraid to bring it up. What do you suggest? I

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,420
Say six months or the first time you see him bone in the FedEx lady. Hey, oh, hey, oh

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,620
That's why that's time to do it

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,400
Most jobs have like an annual or three months or nine month review

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,580
So you might want to check and make sure that that doesn't already exist

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,540
But otherwise bring it up after you've done something really great or something really wrong

36
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,300
Start by joking about it and then the classic a classic McElroy move

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
Suddenly the joke becomes serious

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,660
Oh what happened she's like you've been joking about it and then wait hasn't been a joke

39
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,100
I don't remember but I think he's been talking about it for a long time

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Which you can always see the oh

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
You got to keep in mind. Is that company?

42
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,460
It's worrying about spending its money on things like buying the things

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,460
That it needs to keep its company running and keeping the power turned on at their big

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,100
They don't give they don't give two shits if they're paying you an extra 50 cents an hour

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,780
The only person who cares about that is you so, you know, don't feel like you're inconveniencing them

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,220
I realize the best time to ask for race. It's after the economy is not made of toilets. What's that?

47
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:51,260
How about you wait until that is happening? We're the the your your basic threat is if you don't give me a

48
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,500
Raise I'm quitting and like in most companies. Oh god, thank Christ

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Finally fewer staffers

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,740
I'm gonna let you in on a Travis McElroy secret when I have shitty jobs and I want to get a raise what you do is

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,120
lower your standards lower their standards just start doing a really

52
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,600
Average boring job really only commit about 65 percent every day. Okay, then one week

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,240
Go in and give

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,200
92 percent don't push yourself. Don't wear yourself out or anything, but comparatively it'll make it seem like wow

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,400
He's Travis was beginning a lot better. Hasn't he?

56
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,620
Get a lot better

57
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,680
That is the time to start bringing up like raises and promotions when you really haven't pushed yourself or done anything

58
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,580
You've just lowered their expectations so low

59
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,940
That you can't fuck it up. I thought he got bad for a while, but he seems to be on an upswing

60
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,740
Also, if you're if your bosses seem unreceptive to the idea of giving you a raise

61
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,340
Don't be afraid to dip your snoot in the tiller. Let's get down in there

62
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,100
Maybe you just need a taste just slip a couple twonkies into that back pocket. Hey, there's your twonkies

63
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Did you come in with them? It's I think so

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,460
That tiller just taste

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,780
the tiller

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,620
Form spring asks my bim-bam. I've been chosen to be a best man in my friend's wedding and I've been trying very hard to figure

67
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,620
Out what to say for the toast. Do you have any suggestions?

68
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,540
thanks

69
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,020
hmm

70
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,340
Travis you bring sure there's like a formula to this like open with a joke. Tell a story

71
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Give a well wish for the future

72
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
take a drink or

73
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,140
Take 80 drinks beforehand and then it'll be over before you know it. I

74
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,660
Can remember what you said in your toast? It wasn't a good toast. I

75
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,520
Have only given one best man toast and they're divorced now. So what the fuck do I know?

76
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,700
Apparently just you the opposite of whatever I did

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,940
If you think as long as age advice, I know

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,700
Here's the here's here's your does just say don't get divorced

79
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,940
And if you do it's not on me, it's not on me drop mic

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,260
But drop it hold it horizontally first and then drop it drum like you have to do with all microphones

81
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,180
I don't even know whether it makes fans anymore. What am I gonna do with that?

82
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,060
Didn't you mean drop it on the floor? Cuz that's what I'm doing

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,360
No, just don't say anything that's gonna embarrass the newlywed couple don't ruin the wedding there it is

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,040
Ruin the wedding. Yeah. Yeah, because they spent so much money. It's not your time their time. So don't ruin it by talking about

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,120
Genitalia or anything? Hey my brother my brother and me. I was just wondering I'm gonna be going to college in the fall

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,600
Are there any essential college things that I should do in college? Thank you. That's from Google Voice

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
now

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,160
Let's talk about Google Voice for a second. Okay, we have a we have a toll number toll will not not toll free

89
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,360
There is a toll the toll number the toll free service costs us money and come on

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,800
We're passing it down to the listener to the user

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,540
So you can call that number is two zero three my bim bam one or two zero three six two six two two six one

92
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,320
And leave a message now when you do that, you need to leave your name

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
which

94
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
This person did not do

95
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,080
and you also need to enunciate or

96
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,780
Don't because the transcriptions that Google Voice generates are hilarious

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,480
And I'd like to take a moment to read some of these if that's okay with everyone

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay, are we gonna circle back around on this question or no, we'll come back to it

99
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,640
But I feel this is such an important new feature to my bim bam that I think we need to bring it in

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,320
Well, let me I'll tell you what, let's advise this person real quick because I want to be able to advise

101
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Okay people who have called into Google Voice via their transcriptions, okay

102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,840
Whoever you are just learn just learn. I swear to God if you focus on actually learning

103
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,620
Right in your college years. You will be

104
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,320
literally years ahead of your compatriots and then and and also

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,200
On the flip side that if we can be the devil on your shoulder for a minute, just don't

106
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,620
learn just don't don't go to classes and stuff like just do the

107
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,520
Minimum amount you need to graduate and if you're lucky

108
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,360
You will get to attend a party that's broken up by the FBI

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:48,480
As I did once and that party rules or throw a beach party in your we we we used to have an annual beach

110
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,440
Blush party where we would fill fulfill my friend Jason's apartment was saying and

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,060
It's landlord love that did not get that security deposit back

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Or throw a computer beach party

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,120
What's that everyone YouTube computer beach party whenever you're done doing this I I think

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,480
You should also

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,860
Figure out what you want to do early because nobody has ever switched majors in college and finished. Yep

116
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Commit to a life commit to a life now now. Okay, Google Voice

117
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,200
So Google Voice, let's let's read some gems. Okay

118
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,240
Hey, it's not to choose from everywhere nine

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,720
Well, you know, I was really knows where you at some of that the picks up pick up the phone lines. I I wouldn't touch

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Anyway, my girlfriend's going away on

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Think for about a month and I'm gonna be here alone here and I don't know what to do

122
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,200
I have friends, but anyway, once I just thanks bye

123
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,080
bye-bye

124
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Great question. Well, um, I think is he saying he's got nine girlfriends and they're some of them are going away

125
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
And some of them are still gonna be his friends. I

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,640
Think so and also his girlfriend is on is on his girlfriend's have a lost on

127
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,720
Okay, so his girlfriend's like on point. She is on like 24-7 just drama

128
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,240
It sounds like he's got eight girlfriends that are non-drama girlfriend. He's got one who's just on

129
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,600
24-7 drama drama drama and is she the one leaving it sounds like it for a month

130
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,760
Pick up pick up pick up pick up. So she you're calling her

131
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,320
Okay, and she's not answering and you got eight girlfriends at home. I think you just need to stop worrying

132
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,560
Yeah, I think you're covered. I feel like you got it with this girlfriend scenario

133
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,600
You're like that girl a couple weeks ago who wanted to meet 11 nice guys every week

134
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200

That's the new dance in the south in college campuses on the south

145
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,540
And I'm pretty sure the the Asian guy in the black eyed peas is named loser mall. Is that loser mall? It's will. I am loser mall

146

I do say that this caller is asking about Clarissa explains it all where can they find back up and said that

149
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,980
Probably feature Ferguson from Clarissa explains it all got a sex change operation

150
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Downtown and

151
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,980
Now he's not his uptown not his uptown. He already had location was uptown

152

But okay, he's pieces didn't go to the Bronx or Brooklyn uptown to the nice sex change

153
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,340
Sure, that's where all the good sex change operate. That's right above that. Everyone knows that and Justin

154
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,140
It's right over that really good type place. We went to that one time the really good sex change place

155
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,940
Really good sex change place

Pain you're having in your stomach might be those those rocks or child's toys that you ate because you're so stupid

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,780
You can't get pregnant by dry humping your boyfriend on your period but you can get single pretty quickly

179
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,500
And I could get grossed out. I can't get pretty yuck

180
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Pain you're feeling in your stomach might be the devil you sinner. Yeah, what up? How about you go to church?

But this is what happened the baby. Yeah, they love your baby. You're stupid, baby

183
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,420
It's sex education classes kicked out of schools, this is the result yeah

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Good going America

Yeah future my bim bam listener right there. Hey, I'm leaving my job with two years next week

188
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,540
And I'm very very excited about the move. I know well, there's your first mistake. I can just stop you right here

189
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,780
I know on my last day during my exit interview

190
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,980
I'll be asked why I'm leaving my issue is should I tell my horrible bosses that they suck and

191
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,980
Everyone who works under them hates their lives or should I play nice to avoid burning bridges in case I ever need a reference?

192
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,940
I really want to tell them what's up for the sake of my friends and co-workers. I'm leaving behind Tristan can't help them fact

193
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,380
Just it can always help them. He's a American hero. But anyway, I mean he's up

194
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,620
He's up in Osama's guts in Afghanistan and Iraq right now, but he actually possesses the ability to teleport

195
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,980
You just have to say his name backwards. Yeah, it's not it's not a big deal

196
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Or you can just subscribe to his Twitter feed he's the Triscuit

197
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,540
so

198
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,380
So and he'll just just ask him there. Just ask him on the Twitter. You are not gonna do yourself any good

199
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,900
Uh, but didn't let me ask you this

200
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,140
Did anybody do that for you Laura and the two years you're at that job?

201
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,180
Did anybody have an exit interview where they told their bosses not to be such dill weeds? Probably not. I

202
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,540
Can't think everybody always

203
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,580
Fantasizes about and but you're never going to actually do it. You're gonna roll into that meeting

204
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,860
They're gonna ask why you're leaving you're gonna say well, it was just time and you'll get out and feel like a you know

205
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,180
You know a coward for not saying anything, but no one ever says anything. Yeah, who cares?

206
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
They don't want to hear it. They really don't matter

207
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,340
It doesn't matter what you say. I I or what you do there

208
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,860
You don't have to have some you know grand send-off all you have to do

209
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,140
Just dip that snoot in that tiller Wow, no reason not to do it. They're not gonna fire you

210
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,940
Just dip your snoot in get your snoot deep down in there and just take everything that's not stapled

211
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
How good you'll feel if you give a

212
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,180
Lying in your exit interview, but you know that your pocket is full of staplers

213
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,940
Just full of like staplers and posted notes and cash just cohort. Yes. Oh and throw this out. Why are you leaving?

214
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,940
I could never find a stapler

215
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,900
Good luck and just leave them with that thought and I guarantee you they will spend the next week trying to find a stapler

216
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,860
Hey, that's great, which is correct. This is from a baby

217
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,100
Gmail which is correct. I can be a baby a baby

218
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,620
I couldn't care less or I could care less. I've heard both hues, but we need a definitive answer

219
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,860
You know, it's ironic about this one. The answer is actually in the question, which is so rare

220
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,220
You said it twice

221
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,500
The answer of course is I I couldn't care less

222
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,860
Feeling although it depends on what you're saying. I feel like I couldn't care less is like, you know, fuck it who cares

223
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,340
I couldn't care less. But then if you're having a touching moment, you're like I could care less. That's

224
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm saying a completely different thing. Yeah, I don't care a great deal about what's going on right now

225
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,900
There are levels of caring. Yeah, they're below the current level

226
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,140
That I don't think you should do either. I don't think you should say I don't want

227
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,620
I think you need to get invested in your world make a positive difference team up with us Russell Simmons

229
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,900
And that caring how about work this into your vernacular? I could care more

230
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah, a few people flip the script. Okay

231
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,900
How do you feel about dolphins? I couldn't care more gotta save them all I feel about the oil spill. I couldn't care more

232
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,820
It hurts sometimes

233
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Why did you quit your job because I care too much

234
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,980
I care too much as Arby's to watch you turn it into the freak show that it has become and it's supposed to be a

You know, they're their role models for people and I get the importance of needing to know who is the best

286
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Who is the greatest?

Mom and dad would always you know when I was little say well just lay down and close your eyes

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,940
And it's as good as sleeping, you know

300
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,660
Just lay there and rest and then all of a sudden you're waking up two hours later and you're like, oh, I fell asleep

301
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,580
It's when you try to sleep. It's when you're thinking so hard about it. That's why you can't sleep

302
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,860

305
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,820
You have to dream your superhero. I dream. I'm a superhero that I don't want always knocks me out

306
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,380
I don't know why I just dream. I have superpowers and then

307
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,820
I think it's because I want superpowers so bad that I want to really get into that dream. That's my body's like, here we go

308
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,620
Okay, I like that. I like that. I think maybe it's because you're not stressed

309
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,820
Because you're not stressed by anything because you're thinking about wow superpowers, that would be bomb. Mm-hmm

310
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,060
Um, I I think if you have trouble getting to sleep, then you're not tired

311
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:18,460
Maybe stay up and do something. Yeah, your life's taken away. If you don't want to sleep don't go sleep

312
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,800
So I said I'll tell you what though it trick and you know jokingly most people would say, you know

313
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,420
Have a couple drinks the problem is when you do that, you don't sleep as well

314
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,660
It's the reason if you get really drunk you tend to like wake up

315
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,200
Bright and early because you're not really sinking into that deep restful sleep that you get naturally

316
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,060
So you might fall asleep, but you're not gonna get the same rest you would if you just you know

317
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:46,100
Allowed yourself to fall asleep naturally. That's true. That's true. The drinking thing is not a good

318
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,940
I just think you know, you know what exercise can be good if you exercise during the day. Sometimes you'll sleep better

319
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,020
I think I bet I've heard I have no idea. How could I how could I test that theory?

320
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,540
I don't know also. Oh don't have nightmares. Oh, yeah

321
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,200
Yeah, do everything you are having a dream and it starts to look like a nightmare

322
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,380
You need to just you need to inception that shit and switch it back to a good dream

323
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,760
Well, I haven't seen inception

324
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,620
But I think it's just Leonardo DiCaprio taking nightmares and turning them into sweet sweet dreams. He's like this place looks like a nightmare

325
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,900
Let's get you out of here more flip this script. Look my fingers

326
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,620
Cameron it's there. My fingers are made of rainbows. You're gonna gumdrop candy for it

327
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,780
What are your views ass form spring on the use of recreational drugs?

328
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,460
They're legal people who do them should go to jail. Yeah, but in jail drug. Oh, how's that?

329
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:45,900
How do what are my views on robbing liquor stores? That's a crime. Well, except for Salvia Salvia is legal, right?

330
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,620
Yeah, but don't do that cuz then you'll think the world's ending for about 15 minutes

331
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,140
It's the worst and then you'll and then you'll wish the world of them. Yeah

332
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,740
Wow

333
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,540
Recreational dry. I one time I got as far as recreational drugs the one time I got high on Salvia

334
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,940
I I was still high and my dad called and talked to my wife and

335
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,380
Somehow the conference that my dad joked that my grandmother could see the future and I started crying because my nanny could see the future

336
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,580
So don't so I guess what I'm saying is don't do drugs

337
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,700
Nope, I I did Salvia and now I'm a Zen Buddhist

338
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,700
So there yeah things happen. It was a it was a eye-opening experience

339
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,980
I actually just got back from from the Pitchfork Music Festival where I was constantly surrounded by people

340
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,300
who were enjoying a number of jazz cigarettes and

341
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,700
Let me tell you

342
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,860
That's tough man. It makes people do some crazy things out in the hot Sun

343
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,940
You were just high on music there right and good times. I was high on music and good times

344
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,060
I'm talking but like everyone else around me is like hey Griffin try this jazz cigarette. No, I don't I gotta be strong

345
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:03,900
That's important to keep in mind when you smoke the devil grass. It might be fun for you, but everyone around you hates you

346
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,620
Yeah, everything's like boring because it turns you into an incomprehensible

347
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,220
Comprehensible nanny you're not funny. You're boring. Hey, you start doing that laugh thing and

348
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Slap slap that shit at you

349
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:22,620
Hey, so much different from watching a drunk guy stumble around that shit's funny cuz who knows what he's gonna do. I know

350
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
The weed guy's gonna ask if I've seen

351
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,340
Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. Yes, I have and do I want to watch again? No, I don't

352
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I

353
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,380
But don't do don't do recreational drugs cuz soon you're gonna be out on the streets

354
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:48,020
Like that that lady in Los Angeles who was on the crack that came up and coughed into my mouth as I was walking on

355
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
the sidewalk

356
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,700
She stood in front of me waited for me to open my mouth

357
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:01,260
Oh and then charge them $200 for it you can't salvage that day, you know that

358
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,580
I've recently this is from Scotty who's a lady

359
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,900
Asked us on gmail. I recently started working for my mother

360
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,620
She's running for public office and I'm basically her personal assistant and media director

361
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Which just means I run her Facebook and Twitter

362
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,640
The problem I'm having is that I try to take the job seriously and try to be professional while my mother does the opposite

363
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,760
She'll poke fun at me and treat me like a 14 year old while I'm trying to work

364
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,920
How can I try to establish a work relationship without upsetting her any advice?

365
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,440
That's tough Scotty because that's why a lot of people don't work for their folks

366
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,360
Or I mean, I've I've thought for a long time. I've had the opinion that working for family is not a good idea

367
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,880
Yeah, it's just a weird way. I mean, which is probably not very helpful to you quit give up

368
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,680
I guess I guess you should usually try to ape

369
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,880
The spirit of the boss and like if she's not being serious about it, then you have no reason to take it

370
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,640
Super seriously either. I mean, I I guess is the best advice I give you because that's just gonna cause

371
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
You're not gonna be able to convince her to take it more. Seriously. It's her campaign

372
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Also, you run her Facebook and Twitter

373
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,980
You have the reins to her to her social, you know face

374
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,580
Yeah, so so you can take her hostage

375
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,740
Basically, you can make her treat some really embarrassing shit if she if she you know plays you like a chump

376
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah, say stop playing like a chump moms. Nobody gives anybody respect. You got to earn that shit. Yeah on the street

377
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,860
Yep, I guess what I'm saying is shiver. Yeah, she found her mom to a fight in the exercise yard

378
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,460
Yeah, I think a girl toothbrush in the ribs the old sharpened toothbrush to the ribos

379
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,980
so

380
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
Scotty stabbed your mom Tucker

381
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:57,220
And have to deal with the occasional douchebag customer who thinks it's appropriate to yell and scream at me over policies to practices that aren't

382
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,300
Mine, do you have any suggestions on tactics to respond to people like this?

383
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:07,860
And do I and still keep my sense of self-worth? I have a great suggestion for you Tucker from Gmail go fetal

384
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,400
I think Ellen you go fetal and it's like oh, what did I do?

385
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,120
They won't know what they did and you're not gonna tell them cuz you're fetal right now

386
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,900
And and and then and what do they have to do now? They're concerned about your well-being. That's call over your boss

387
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,180
They say look I was this person went fetal. What were you doing?

388
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,800
I was kind of yelling at him and stuff get out of my store

389
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,580
Wake wait wake up Tucker. It's okay. They're gone now. You're fading acting up again. Yeah, it is

390
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,620
Do you want to take the rest of the day off? Yeah. Yeah, I think so boom go see Inception

391
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,380
Thanks for yelling at me D bag, I'll see you in the popcorn line

392
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,100
Yeah, that's it let's move on yeah go fetal

393
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,100
Benjamin asks via Gmail dear McElroy clan. I'm 19 and my girlfriend has just given birth to my first son Alfie

394
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,140
Congratulations

395
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,820
My question is how do I become fatherly?

396
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,060
Well, I generally wear a dressing gown and slippers when lazing around and do enjoy a war

397
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,300
There's originals along with other boiled sweets. Do I need to start smoking a pipe or wearing a tweed jacket?

398
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:21,500
Yeah, I mean, I mean you jumped right over you went straight to great-grandfather Lee man. I

399
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:28,460
Often tell my kids about the war. Yeah, I make him put coconut oil on my leg. Let's get rid of my varicose veins what?

400
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,020
you confuse that like your dad is supposed to be the only trip to being a dad is to

401
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,860
Constantly let your child know that you could beat the shit out of them at any given moment

402
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,100
Your your old man has to be old man strong, which means that your old man is stronger than you always

403
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,980
Like physical strength and mental strength don't hit your kids folks

404
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,500
That's all I'm saying you need make them live in constant fear that you will yeah, and that it'll hurt so back

405
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,740
You're so strong, right? I remember strong

406
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,420
I remember once playing board games with the family and dad beat clue in one round

407
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:12,300
Solve that shit solve that game piece in one round and that to me also is part of old man strength that idea of my

408
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,580
Dad is a is a genius. Yeah, I was just thinking about

409
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,140
Leading a family revolt up to that point and then dad

410
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Alpha dog

411
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,500
I guess we're saying to be the alpha dog

412
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,380
And don't could also enjoy the one year that you've legally been allowed to vote

413
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
But congratulations on your child

414
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,100
Also marry her come on man. Yeah, I think put a ring on it put a ring on it. You clearly like it

415
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,660
I recently got a new girlfriend and this reform string and I've been trying to introduce my friends to her a select few all dudes

416
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,580
Seem to be acting as if she has to play or the plague or something

417
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,380
They don't want me coming over to their house with her anymore. What the hell happened? Oh, Jesus dude. She's terrible

418
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,780
Can we consider the possibility that she is legitimately bubonic. Oh, she's got the boobs

419
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:16,580
No, I mean like I think I'm the new coolest description of a girl ever like bootylicious. Oh, yeah girls bubonic

420
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,940
She's a bubonic straight boom. Um, you

421
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,660
See the boo bonds on her. She's cold bubonic

422
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:29,260
I mean if your girlfriend's wearing the mask of red death you you probably well first you shouldn't be dating her

423
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,740
But you definitely shouldn't expose your friends to her. Yeah, what kind of friend friend quote unquote friend, I guess

424
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,180
semi friend

425
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,300
Friend with benefits that benefit being the plague. Mm-hmm

426
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,380
Everyone come come be around come drink up the humors

427
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,500
Of my totally sick girlfriend. She got my girlfriend the outbreak monkey

428
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,820
enjoy

429
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Yeah

430
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah, she's bad she's bad not a good person they

431
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,820
you got a way against like

432
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,420
One of two things has happened either

433
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,860
She is terrible or she makes you act like a terrible person because they like you right and they know it's gonna be awkward

434
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:16,860
If they don't like your girlfriend, so one of those two things is happening. It's not it's not anything they're doing. I'm sure

435
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,700
So you really need to like examine it take it take a step back

436
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,340
Also, there's a chance. She's stealing stuff. She might be stealing stuff from their house

437
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,100
Why would she do that? So next time she picks up next time she picks up anything anything?

438
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,620
Point at her face and yell thief as loud as you can

439
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,100
I mean see how she reacts. Yeah, AJ if she's like if she like drops it and

440
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,140
Run just prints and throws herself through a plate glass window. You know, hey, you nailed her. You got her good one

441
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,540
Yahoo answers user tree tops. This is an important question. We rarely deal with matters of health. Okay on this show

442
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:02,180
That's so I think there's a gonna tree tops asks. Is there an easier way to lose weight than this?

443
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,160
in the description of this question

444
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,600
Treetops has pasted a link to the music video for rock lobster

445
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,180
No, no, the answer is clearly no, but I mean the Atkins diet maybe but that's a temporary

446
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,580
Ketosis only lasts for so long rock lobster. That's a deep burn

447
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:37,580
a deep burn you will be reddened after that down muscles and it breaks down all the fatty acids the fatty layers and

448
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,660
They just fall off your body. I'm a big proponent of

449
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
People I feel like people are born

450
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,740
Into their sexual preference

451
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,460
But I'm pretty sure if you go from being a fat guy to a skinny guy

452
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,300
Because you work out to rock lobster constantly that would make you gay

453
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,780
I am a hundred percent sure you will be gay after that that will make you into a gay person

454
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,900
That's the only surefire way to switch it up. I think I think to switch it back. You just have to see the expendables

455
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,900
Well, that could go one of two ways I think there's a lot of beefcake in that movie Wow

456
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,860
Wow, it's like a beef bakery in there. It's it's like a beef bakery

457
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
making sweet beef breads

458
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Oh

459
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,180
Delicious

460
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,820
People often say that I look like Jack Black. Is that a good thing form spring? Nope?

461
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,660
That's code. He's the one chubby guy in who they let be in movies

462
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,620
So I would rather get Jack Black than Jonah Hill

463
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
sure

464
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,060
Yeah, yeah, I guess that's true but

465
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,740
Just to protect black sucks now name one good thing Jack Black has done and in like the past five years

466
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:59,860
Year one comedy movie. Maybe you didn't Wow. That was the worst thing I've ever seen I couldn't finish that movie. It was terrible

467
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,100
I don't know. Have you seen me on your own your version?

468
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
On your own. Yeah

469
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,220
Yeah, I think I've seen that one

470
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,380
It is better in Spanish. You really get the deep deep subtext

471
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,020
The subtext being me you're wasting your life on year one. Oh Harold Ramis made me sad

472
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,520
But my heart tired, I would rather get Jack Black than Chris Catan

473
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,660
You but you do get Chris Catan not tonight because you look at Chris good hand

474
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,540
But but with the beard, it's probably a part of that's probably been lightened, right?

475
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,340
I actually I got told the other day I look like a grizzled Chris Catan

476
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,580
Who's been through some shit like Chris Catan has oh

477
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,060
Boy, it's been in some shit. I don't know if he's been through it

478
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,460
All I can think of somewhere Chris Catan is getting more and more attractive every day

479
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:56,180
It was less grizzled. Yeah as I become more grizzled like a portrait of Dorian Gray kind of thing

480
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,220
I

481
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,820

We got two t-shirts I've already described them

509
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
But two t-shirts

510
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
I think they're like 19 bucks

511
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:08,740
You can and and double XL's and triple XL's cost like a buck more because it's a it's a fatty tax

512
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,520
And you can add that better yet you can get

513
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,240
10% off of the pre-order if you use the special code

514
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,640
Walnut at checkout whisper it. Well, I think it's I think it's better if we whisper the secret code whisper the secret code. Don't time

515
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,520
Yeah, you use that secret code and you'll get 10% off your pre-order these are it I

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,240

539
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,260
Talking about the little guy. It's great

540
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:37,680
Boy finally the big shit. Well, let's not go see okay. Maybe I should return that Lamborghini

00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,980
Our final question of today comes to us from William II who asks

542
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:52,300
Does anyone remember a Sudafed medicine commercial that aired from 1992 to 1993 that shows a woman and her car
