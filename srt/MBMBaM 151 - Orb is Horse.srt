1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,240
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me. An advice show for the modern era,

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:01:05,200
and it's the most magical day of the year for us horse aficionados. It's Kentucky Derby Day.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
What they call a acid magnet.

8
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,000
The way the mint leaves, you got to filter them out with your teeth.

9
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,800
Actually hate that. That's why I can't drink juleps. You want to work while you drink?

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm hoping I can get through the entire race without my action winding down because I'm TikTok.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,160
That's good. A good joke tip for everybody is if you name what you're referencing when you

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,880
reference it. Yeah, it's comedy 101. That's what they taught us at comedy school before we could

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,360
do this podcast. I wanted to tell you guys that I was looking at the horses, and there's one that

14
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,080
I wanted to point out to you specifically, and it is my favorite name of a horse that is running in

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:08,560
the Kentucky Derby, and here it is. Are you ready for it? Yeah. Orb. You know orb one. I am orb.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,440
Orb one the Kentucky Derby. Well of course because he has the maximum amount of space,

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,920
the maximum efficiency of space used in a geometric object. Well he also has the most

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,600
streamlined name. Right. You know everybody else has like those longs like you know like a Stephen's

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:36,480
left shoe or something you know and it's just orb. Yeah. What if orb was a sentient globe that

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,440
insisted he was a horse? I am orb. I am a horse like your earth horses. You must admit me to the

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
race. I am horse. You are not horse. I am horse. Do not pay attention to how my horse legs don't

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:03:01,680
touch the ground. I am a hover horse. I am horse. Please inter oats into my oat deposit slot.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:13,280
I am horse. I am not an orb. I am named orb. Provide me one metric cube of sweet glycerin,

24
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,760
and I shall tell your fortune. And also win your primitive horse race. Also I need a jockey.

25
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:30,160
If you know of any jockeys, I do need one please. One with preferably a long, a really good wingspan

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm going to need because I'm spherical and 20 feet in diameter. You might need to paint him with

27
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,800
some kind of glue. I must. Ironic I know. I must win your horse, your earth horse race so I may

28
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:53,760
make love to your earth horse women. Did you guys say your names? Because mine's just. Orb is a very

29
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:06,000
sexual being. I come from the advanced future of 5024. Everyone is a geometric shape and everyone

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,680
loves to party. Please find me a horse that I will not crush to death. And make sure she's down.

31
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,600
Make sure she's down to clown with a sex ball. Because orb is also only about consensual sex.

32
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,920
Orb knows that real men take no for an answer. Travis. Uh huh. You want to say your name?

33
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm Travis. I'm Griffin. Were there any other hit? It's because I watched part of the derby

34
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,320
yesterday and I don't remember seeing anything that really. Usually you'll get a.

35
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,440
Well my favorite part was when cube just sat there. Fucking cube. That's a terrible horse.

36
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:06,400
Cube bad. Yes cube you are bad. Cube not go good. Cube need a push. Horse other horse pull cube?

37
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,360
No. No. Let's help people. What do you think? Okay. I guess we can do that. I'm ready to help.

38
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,720
Uh last week I asked a close friend girlfriend of a friend. Oh Jesus. You can do this. Cube bad at reading.

39
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,880
Cube bad. Yes cube is bad. Last week I asked a close girlfriend of a year and a half out on a date.

40
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm a dude bt dubs. She said no. Meanwhile in the week since my rejection I have developed feelings

41
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,120
for her best friend. Oops. My question is this. Is it too soon to pursue a relationship with her

42
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,440
bestie? And that's betwixt in Bristol. I love starting off the episode with with these easy lobs.

43
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:54,720
This easy lob uh no. Definitely. Whoa hold on Justin. Of course it's too soon. Too soon for what?

44
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,320
Here's here's why. She turned him down. Let me convince you. Who's feelings is he worried about? Let me convince you.

45
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,240
It's not about feelings. It's about. Nothing's about feelings. No it's not about feelings. Cube doesn't have feelings.

46
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,440
It's about like if okay so you ask out her friend. She says no and then you ask her out. It doesn't

47
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,360
look good. It makes you look insincere is my worry. It makes you look like you're going well

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm just gonna keep asking everyone out till they say yes. I was gonna I was gonna ask if you think

49
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
her friend knows that she asked her out but like of course she does. Yeah that's that's I think that's

50
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,320
the problem. I think you come across as just like oh okay not you. Well what about you? And that that's

51
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,920
not a good way to start a relationship. Gosh you know that's a weird uh I'm not I'm not familiar

52
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,200
with that sort of like shift happening. Nobody's ever turned Justin down for a day. It's never

53
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:53,040
happened. God no. I've never been to well a dozen times but like not like it hasn't like seriously

54
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,880
that hasn't happened once. It's happened many many more times. Many once. Many once's that

55
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,160
have made. A baker's dozen of once's. Yeah it's true. It's once I get this baby weight off I'm

56
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,480
gonna be out there though. I'm gonna be you watch. Oof um I think I think I think you got a point

57
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Trav. I think that this person is not going to be able to divorce the fact that you literally just

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,440
asked out their best friend. Like it's it's just it's probably not going to go well. Also you need

59
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,640
to take a long look in that deep dark truthful mirror and figure out did you just meet this

60
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,520
best friend and that's why you develop feelings for her or was it the person that you wanted turned

61
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,360
you down and so like maybe if they accuse you of just wanting sloppy seconds maybe they're not too

62
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
far off base if you got a no from somebody and immediately look to your right and we're like

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,160
well you then. But okay there is an unless. Isn't that contrary to sort of what we tell people

64
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:03,760
who put too much emphasis on asking someone out on a date like doesn't that sort of um. He didn't

65
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
say that though he said he developed feelings for that person which is like I don't know it seems

66
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,560
like a weird thing to do literally in the week since her friend turns you down like yeah it

67
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,280
yeah it really does seem the unless. What's the unless? Unless she also has feelings for you and

68
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,240
you've you know like the whole thing with the best friend was. See that is what I was like and you

69
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,080
just met her. Yeah when I when I read the question I envisioned sort of like a um her friend in the

70
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,280
glasses was there the entire time helping you to write love notes and then you didn't see

71
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,000
what was right in front of you. But the thing is the only person that could answer that is you.

72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
You think the only person who could answer that is me? Travis how would I have any insight into

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,520
this? No Justin no Justin the the royal you. The royal you or also capital y o u. Orb could

74
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,960
probably shed some light on the situation. All things go for it. No this really is some

75
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Midsummer Night's Dream shit this is some I think what this person needs to do is get both of these

76
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,320
women together. Go into the forest get a little pixie juice up in their eyes. Right. And then

77
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,440
one of them will turn into a goat and then. Have you seen Midsummer Night's Dream? It's been a

78
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,800
while. Yes I've seen the fucking yeah Travis I saw the Shakespeare production that you guys did.

79
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,920
Of course I did it was a special day for me. Anyway one of you turns into a goat

80
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,320
a ghost haunts you and then. There's Stanley Tucci watch out. But it's like a modern remake

81
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,640
so like it's got that sort of Boz Luhrmann touch to it. The original was a remake by Boz Luhrmann.

82
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Him and Billy Shakespeare were best friends I don't know if you guys knew that.

83
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,720
Boz Luhrmann is 50,000 years old. He's clean living. Clean living. Clean clean living and

84
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,840
regularly just expelling his artistic juices that helps him to decompress and continue to live.

85
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:11,200
Yeah. You guys want a yahoo? Yeah please. This yahoo was sent in by Marina Baker. Thank you Marina

86
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
we really should have done this at the beginning of the show. It's from yahoo interview user 123

87
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,360
who asks my mom got me a pony but I didn't want one. I already told her before a million times

88
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,280
that I don't want a pony. I've never wanted a pony and I don't know why some girls are so obsessed

89
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
with the thought of having them and even then only little kids like ponies. I'm 13 for fuck's sake.

90
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,240
It doesn't say fuck. I could have gotten so many other things for the amount of money she spent on

91
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,280
that effing pony. It's just because she wanted a pony as a kid so it's her present for herself.

92
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,960
Wow what a fucking great birthday. It's boring and I don't know what to do with it. Even a real

93
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,920
horse would have been better but still a goddamn waste of time and money. How do I get her to bring

94
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,080
that piece of s back? I don't want it. F. Does she know that like a pony will become horse?

95
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:07,280
Given infinite amount of time and oats horse do pony do become horse. Right. Pony be horse.

96
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:17,520
Ponies be horses. That was actually one of my professors in college. Dr. Ponies be horses.

97
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:28,320
Um man I what kind of lack of imagination does this does this what do I even do with this what

98
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,640
do I do with this you can do anything with it dress him up take him to sheriff take him into

99
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,520
the woods and go on an adventure with him reenact the first scene from walking dead yeah well not

100
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,160
the part one okay not that you know that you could pretend like you're um like a kentucky lawman

101
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,560
yeah yeah you can play little justified dress him like a horse and dress him like a dog and then

102
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,520
walk him in the park that just really fuck with people just really mess with people also like

103
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,800
okay from a functional standpoint it we i think we've covered the fact that there's infinite

104
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,680
things you can do with a small horse hopefully we've did with this vertical slice of course

105
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,320
possibilities we've demonstrated that but i think of it also as a status symbol here's what you do

106
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
you call your friends over and say check out this fucking small horse i got you got one of your

107
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
friends over like i got a new xbox game and they're like is that a horse in your backyard

108
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,320
like oh yeah yeah yeah but check this out yeah check out my tony hawk jump is that do they still

109
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,240
make tony hawk no tony hawk's just there her mom buys her a lot of shit sure you bought me a young

110
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,400
tony hawk i hate it it's boring and i don't know it'll never be able to do the 900 it will someday

111
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:50,240
it's some kid shit just feed it some oats i can't believe that even i i don't got place for a horse

112
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,960
in my house it would just eat up the herb garden um but i would still be kind of psyched to have

113
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,160
one you know what i mean now a horse does seem like one of those things that i would be psyched

114
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,200
to have for like a week and then the reality of the situation would sink in and i'd be like oh

115
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,280
i can't do i don't know where to keep this aren't there places there are places like people run

116
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,360
places to put horses right nope oh no no they haven't invented that yet no too bad that's a

117
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,840
good idea you should kick start that thank you you should kick start it can you think of really

118
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,880
quick off the top of your head what you would call it uh horse homes no horse homes horse hook

119
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,800
hoof in and hook in and it's i nn right exactly i'm not sure mine was better i'm not sure business

120
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:50,720
like that would be stable trev oh christ see what we did i did see it it's you can't unsee it now

121
00:13:50,720 --> 00:14:01,840
this arrow in the fedex logo i usually i like to stay away from derogative terms that people use

122
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,520
for women but i'm gonna have to bust it out in this instance because this this young lady is

123
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,800
being a real fussy hussy oh man don't see any other way around it can you call it out like i

124
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,440
can see it i guess she is being kind of a fussy hussy what kind of person when given a horse by

125
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,760
their parents no matter what age you are goes oh fuck you mom no i get i get it this mom's pulling

126
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,320
this shit all the time she buys her like a uh the the lynda ronstadt record that she didn't get

127
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
there's a signed david cassidy poster exactly exactly and she's not thinking about how the fact

128
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,800
that she wants she wants like backstage passes to see neo or drake she did you know what this seems

129
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:54,160
like i bet you that this situation could really be mended with a little freaky friday magic oh man

130
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,080
but then what if the mom's like no this is great that's what i'm saying i don't want to switch back

131
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,840
freaky friday magic it this this girl is obviously she she hates her childish things she she's 13 for

132
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,480
fuck's sake you know what i mean she wants to be if she was 41 all the better and the mom would be

133
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:21,440
like cool i'll take your kid body yeah now that i'm 32 i can attest to the fact that any freaky

134
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,280
friday situation that i was in would not culminate with me trying to find a gypsy to reverse the

135
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,840
spell it would culminate in me buying a bus ticket and getting the hell away from whatever could

136
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,560
reverse this because oh my god i have it back again whatever this was i have the gift the inner

137
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,040
the gift the inner the life the vibrance trapped in the 42 year old body going everything hurts

138
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,080
and i gotta pee all the time and i'm sad for no reason and the adult and the kid body being like

139

140
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,200
and the the kid in the adult body is like why am i gleaning satisfaction from a clean house

141
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:11,120

i'll take your fucking pony i'll take your fucking pony you're ungrateful you're angry

143
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,680
are there any yahoo answers people volunteering to take the pony off their hands because that's

144
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,360
what someone on yahoo answers really needs is pony access poor uh morbert altison says poor pony

145
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,760
frown face i'm sure it doesn't feel that way about you try being friends with it

146
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,240
you don't think it's for one moment that the horse goes i wish you would just come out here what you

147
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,520
think that pony rolls up day one and the little girl's like you are a waste of money that pony's

148
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,760
not gonna be like well fuck you too then you realize i'm fucking majestic right right like

149
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,480
i'm the i'm god's most majestic creature and yes my some my fee was a little exorbitant

150
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,360
but you you know what i mean you just gotta spend money to make ponies you can't make it

151
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,960
on without breaking a few ponies exactly i can't imagine that like a horse that isn't gonna get

152
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,520
ridden all the time isn't kind of jazzed about that because the horse will still get fed oats

153
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,800
and that's all horses care about so the horse can keep living its life and it's like if there

154
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,920
was a such a thing as a sentient backpack full of concrete that i had to wear from time to time

155
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,240
i would not want to be buzzed with it i would not have it look into in my charcoal dead eyes

156
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,840
and my four beautiful powerful legs and and if it looked at me and didn't think like oh i'm gonna

157
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,280
climb on your back and be really heavy and try to let you try to break your spirit like break you

158
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,640
break you that's the terminology people use for horses you know yeah break him yeah like um i

159
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,240
think the pony's gonna like him from afar one of the yahoo answers users said uh tell your mom

160
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,440
quick you don't want it and you want her to take it back can you imagine that pony store like seeing

161
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,640
her walk up with the pony and she's like yeah she wanted to return it and they're like a non-starter

162
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
she wants she wants to she want i don't under i don't even understand what you're saying this

163
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,360
child didn't want the pony we don't have hey dale do we have a return policy we don't we never we

164
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,960
never pinned one because this is this is fucking unthinkable let me call hq no okay i called pony

165
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,560
hq this has never happened this is literally the first time i guess you can have your money back

166
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:44,480
but it's it's used now we're just gonna shoot it it's already formed the bond with one that's

167
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,040
imprinted like we can't give it to someone else she's just gonna keep showing up in your backyard

168
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,080
right and especially when your daughter has her life threatened because the pony has a life debt

169
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,000
after your daughter so of course she's going to be there when she's in danger right oh god no i

170
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,600
think you can reverse a pony imprint i think if i went up to this pony with a teaspoon of sugar

171
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,680
you'd be like oh you're my i guess i'm yours now oh peanut butter life life life that's on you

172
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,200
you i'm a sophomore in college and i'm not having any fun because i have no friends i have the

173
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,960
opportunity to transfer to a school where i already know people the problem is all my credits

174
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
won't transfer if i stay where i am i will be able to graduate in a year but if i leave i have to stay

175
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,880
two more years do you guys think i should go and have fun or stay and graduate early friendless in

176
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,960
philly friendless in philly wait please stop don't please please don't graduate college please yeah

177
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,960
you gotta transfer you gotta actually just keep transferring just transfer as many times as you

178
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,080
can van wilder just don't leave please don't leave college please here's the thing i didn't learn

179
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,560
shit in college i didn't sorry dad but i didn't but what i did learn is how to how to fucking

180
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,200
party you know what i mean that's that's real that's legit those life experiences that's not

181
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,360
just van wilder movie magic it's legit and it happens and you gotta be a part of it hey i wanna

182
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,000
uh i wanna offer you a secondary theory maybe just something to keep in mind uh when you go

183
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to your new school because you have to go to a new school trust me please don't ever leave college

184
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,920
uh but i would say that to someone in elementary school or middle school or high school either and

185
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,720
i don't think those are great life choices either to try to stay in those but there you go um i

186
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,440
think you scissors teach gotta stick around another year well two plus two equals four

187
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,440
no problem day one got it what you got what else you got uh i i um it sounds to me if unless my

188
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,120
math is off that you are talking about how you're going to graduate college in three years i would

189
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,440
posit the theory that maybe you might be having more fun and have more friends if you weren't

190
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,920
taking like an insane course load like because it sounds like you're trying to jam a lot of college

191
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,480
into three years oh i see what you're saying am i doing the math wrong they said they're a sophomore

192
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,680
they're going to graduate in a year like yeah i wouldn't think you'd have much time for friends

193
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,720
really it's not like you're saying you're going to be there for five or six years you're going

194
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,040
to be there like the normal four yeah i mean that's normal if you're going for you know like

195
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,200
a normal bachelor's yeah degree yeah if you if you didn't do it in four years then you're not

196
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,160
you're abnormal is it travis is basically saying you're an idiot monster creep if you did listen

197
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,200
normal is such a flexible term right well let's just let's just raise our hands let's just do a

198
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,320
really quick round the well because i'm i i know for certain but it's just you know it's just for

199
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,480
the radio audience that everybody on the podcast did it did it in four so um just just getting that

200
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,560
fact out there and just putting it out there for everybody well well well you know i think shorter

201
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:10,000
than four is weird but longer than four i feel like that is not an uncommon situation that people

202
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,920
find themselves in when they fail oh you mean like yeah i'm sorry of course justin i i god how silly

203
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,440
of me uh yeah if you go back for like your post-grad for like your master yeah yeah yeah

204
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:32,240
you know sometimes sometimes you end up in college for five years and you're not even sure about why

205
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
like because you took a year off to like really find oh yeah yeah or maybe you did like a you

206
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,240
know an apprenticeship somewhere i guess it's maybe okay what if you did take a year off

207
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
but you kind of burst it out through several afternoons

208
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:54,880
that's over the course of three years i took a year off let's yeah let's go with that that

209
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,920
sounds good that sounds real uh yeah i was in college for five years because i failed

210
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,040
spanish i don't really want to delve too deep into that i don't care can you speak spanish now

211
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,760
see which is the grade you got in the class the second

212
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:21,360
year i actually this i i don't know if i've told this particular anecdote before but i walked in

213
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,160
to my fourth like the fourth spanish class and i had not done well in any of my spanish classes

214
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,640
and i had to have this to graduate because of some sort of you know effort to make story

215
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,880
students more multicultural uh and i i walked in the fourth class and the man spoke nothing

216
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,320
but spanish and he would make homework assignments in spanish so of course i didn't do them i don't

217
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,000
speak spanish right so i failed it and then i had i retook a uh a spanish class it was more like

218
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,560
culture and that worked out a lot better yeah you had to learn how to make microwave nachos

219
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:07,280

317
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,960
clinical sense so that we don't get you i so we don't totally duck out the remainder of our

318
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,720
audience there's a real answer to this okay there is there's a real scrotum the scrotum

319
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,120
is the body's thermostat it's an amazing it's an amazing invention i'm glad somebody invented the

320
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,920
scrotum because we would have been in a real a real god verse into the other guy's room just

321
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,600
like i figured it out dave cracked it hey god i hate to bother you because i know you're busy

322
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,400
my balls suck right now can you can you can you can you maybe tweak the schematic a little bit

323
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,720
maybe let me see what i can do maybe get a little temperature control up in here i don't i don't

324
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,720
want to like i'm thank you for the life and the love and the good times and the livestock

325
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,360
they're just hanging but they're just hanging there and they are just freely affected by

326
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:52,640
temperature and changes barometric it all is bad but anytime the scrotum the scrotums are like an

327
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,680
overprotective mom at the slightest sense of danger she's like whoa hold on hold on wait

328
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,920
it's a little chilly let me bundle you let me hold you close come here come here let me just

329
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,240
get you got dinners ready in the pubis you know people didn't have scrotums when we were first

330
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:19,440
made god didn't actually invent scrotums until the year seven in the year seven god invented

331
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,200
he looked down upon his creation and said this will not do i have i have i'm gonna retcon this

332
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,600
so no one ever knows but uh oh all that stuff all that stuff in the bible about the scrotum

333
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,320
mistakes i need you to i need you to get out the white out strike that please strike that strike

334
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,240
that that was actually there's actually three time periods there's ad there's bc and then there's bs

335
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,640
mm-hmm do you guys think that god okay so god's omnipotent right yes do you think that god has

336
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,880
the ability to like yeah maybe god does make mistakes but after he does him he's like ah

337
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,200
ah me damn it i gotta go back and uh make a make the scrotums and but he like retcons right so he

338
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,400
goes back to adam and eve and he's like listen i'm gonna have to set this up for you right now

339
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,800
let me see your stuff real quick just for a second just get a leaf and turn it into a okay check it

340
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,400
out you're set i'm gonna go back to the present and see how this is affected things because i

341
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,200
bet it's like a really big change um you seem a lot more active now that there's a projection

342
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,880
around those people people don't just sit in corners with their hands cupping their testicles

343
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,400
oh which i imagine is a lot like the oud from uh from dr hair that's what we were before scrotum

344
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,400
um this guy has phrased this question in an uh extremely unorthodox manner

345
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,400
meaning on yahoo answers well yes but also what is a normal day like asking what a normal day is

346
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,720
is implies that there are diaries involved well you don't want to ask your doctor about

347
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,520
like what's it supposed to be like on the worst day of your scrotum's life

348
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,080
i guess that's true what's a great day for you what's like the best day for the scrotum for me

349
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,240
there's this one day where i just like sat around in the hot tub all day and really just kept my

350
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,120
legs spread really wide open and didn't do anything for me in middle school a great day

351
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:34,480
for my testicles was not being barraged upon there there was a a i'll call it a trend it was a it was

352
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,520
a trending hashtag at my middle school for uh young women uh to just kick the boys as hard as

353
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,840
they possibly could in the balls as with as much force as the end i mean women develop earlier

354
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:58,240
than men so their kick strength is like magnitudes stronger than ours uh and so bad was this so bad

355
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,240
was this uh this trend that they had to make like a loudspeaker announcer saying like hey everyone

356
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:13,040
can you stop fucking kicking them in the balls as hard as you possibly can middle school when

357
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,400
people talk about privilege uh i that's one of the things they forget you know oh yeah there's a

358
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,520
there what about your privilege maybe check your privilege teenage girls and stop kicking

359
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:33,280
uh men in the balls maybe do that and we can maybe start building some bridges here right help whenever

360
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,520
someone talks about something embarrassing with me i turn bright red i'm learning this at age 23

361
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,040
after spending years trying to develop a poker face is there a uh a way to stop this hue change

362
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,560
alternatively is this a skill i can use to my advantage and that's from um uh they've

363
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:58,400
used the uh they've used the uh hexadecimal code for red here i believe i'm not a computer programmer

364
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,320
but uh oh wait so are you are you asking how to stop being embarrassed or how to stop physically

365
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:14,160
showing it like i don't think they want to turn red like i think that they are it's like the poker

366
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,240
face you know what i mean like they don't want to be red when they're embarrassed because they want

367
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,000
to try to lie and say that they're not embarrassed you know what's an affectation no one uses

368
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,760
everybody has like top hats or like you know everybody has those everybody everybody has

369
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,680
a bolo tie you're saying what about a neutral mask i don't know what that means a neutral mask

370
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,600
it's like the plain white mask that has no facial expression oh that's all that a murderer would

371
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,840
wear yeah like a terrifying scary mask okay well are you travis somehow telling me that whatever

372
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,440
uh uh social issues this person aims to fix by not having their face turned bright red could

373
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,520
somehow be ameliorated in any way by wearing a murderer mask is that okay so what is okay so

374
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:13,360
picture this world poker tour champion i cannot even allow you this theoretical diversion you

375
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,640
can't wear reflective sunglasses but you can wear full face murder masks i feel like it's a really

376
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
good poi but it's like well i'm gonna lay this hand down so they don't kill me later yeah i bet

377
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,240
a dollar everybody folds please don't fucking stab us to death i bet one dollar and this knife

378
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,080
just gonna put it up here and put it over my cards i have a pair of knives stab stab stab stab

379
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:44,400
stab that's actually the plot of rounders too that they just one time i have a johnny choo

380
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,880
i've got a mask i've got a straight edge knife that you are now being killed with by me

381
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,440
that was that poker the poker poker you would have to kill i feel like you would

382
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,600
to cement that i feel like you would have to kill one person at a poker table and then after that

383
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,840
well yeah jussie you're not murdering hands you're not you're not murdering sweet pockets

384
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,160
you know what i mean that's what they call it when you win a pot and poke sweet pockets uh-huh

385
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,120
like you win one and then that guy who wears his glasses upside down is like oh sweet pocket

386
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,520
all right thank you like all sane people my favorite poker player is devil fish

387
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,920
oh man and he said that he got that name by playing against the the triad gangs

388
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,920
they called him the devil fish and i am just now at 32 years old here on this sunday morning

389
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,560
realizing that that story was probably bullshit it did not occur to me until this exact moment

390
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,480
thinking about devil fish that he probably did not get that name from triad gangs he probably

391
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,600
just got it from his uncle danny or something hard pill to swallow i guess but yeah but in

392
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,720
reality i have no idea why you turn red what are we what are we fucking scientists here yeah

393
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,120
i don't know science bros get really tan leather yourself up and no one will ever see tan mom

394
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:17,680
that's a suggestion you can make it's the worst suggestion maybe go in blackface okay that will

395
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,800
that won't be okay the red thing won't be a problem anymore so you'll have that going for

396
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,680
look we fixed your problem like some sort of demented genie we've corrected

397
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,960
corrected your problem but at what cost you know what you wish for

398
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,160
forever blackface you could probably get rid of a lot of social problems with blackface i mean

399
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,600
really i don't know how to talk to strangers well blackface will fix that blackface should fix it

400
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,760
yeah they're gonna know just what to say to you hey fuck you what are you doing with that makeup

401

excuse me pardon me sorry college women i have a suggestion for you go to college go to college

413
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:26,240
it's the only man this question bums me out there is no can either of you brainstorm right now and

414
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,360
give me a situation where somebody yelling at you from their car may either stranger danger or a

415
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,720
trusted associate is a good thing because even when i'm like driving and i see a friend in their

416
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,560
car and they roll down their window to talk to me all i can think about is when that light turns

417
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,680
green i hope we're at a organic stopping point in the conversation because i'm just going to

418
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:55,200
speed off is there any situation where it's okay no there's like i can't even come up with a joke

419
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,320
answer please don't ever do that if you drive past someone and you hear someone yell at you

420
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,320
yeah as they're driving past it does not matter what they say that all of a sudden you are in the

421
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,040
most unpleasant experience let's air out let's air out our dirty laundry okay we used to do this a

422
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,640
lot okay we used to live next to a park where that had a big walking path right next to the road

423
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,800
so we would yell at people as we drove by when we were high school college age

424
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,920
right but we would yell compliments at them right like hey cool jeans

425
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,920
and it's a smart top is the nothing sexually charged nothing that was not our seat no no

426
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,240
it's not like that like yell things like you're making great time yeah yeah this is your best

427
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,880
lap ever keep it healthy but we knew and still the facial reactions from the people were like

428
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,920
you yelled nice cans you know it's always like what fuck you because people just they're gonna

429
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,760
react that way because you're yelling at them you're yelling at them and you're in a car it's

430
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,600
like they're everybody's worst nightmare sentient car i also would say i would rather have someone

431
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,440
yell at me as they drive by then like pull up to the curb and slide to a stop and right so

432
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,040
that's talk to me that's a that's a horse of a different color entirely and i can't it's never

433
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:28,720
happened to me obviously every every every muscle and bone in your body is devoted to sending the

434
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,600
the visual signal that you were unapproachable even when griffin wears his sweet short shorts

435
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,880
no one's ever pulled out to the side of the right you want to wear champion pants nobody pulls up

436
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:45,440
there's never been a crossroads-esque scenario that has unfolded organically to me nobody's

437
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,680
even asked for directions because i always look lost i always have my phone up people just assume

438
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:56,240
i'm google mapping wherever i am um it's not happened to me so but i don't want the whole

439
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,560
podcast to become about that i've lived a good life full life i regret nothing i regret absolutely

440
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:10,160
nothing but i like if i was if the shoes were reversed the problem would be super uncomfortable

441
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:19,040
shoes are designed to go on a very specific way but don't hit on women outside of cars

442
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,680
you still can't you relationships are not available through drive-through this is the exact

443
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,920
same uh that you know what this reminds you it's like the same thing with the bank teller question

444
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,840
right can i hit on uh women who are working at the bank as i drive through and the answer is no

445
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:42,240
no like you cannot pick up anybody you can't ask someone out on a date if you have like

446
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,520
an immediate convenient means of egress like that's cheating yeah and everybody knows it's

447
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,960
also symbolically like symbolism there is very scary because it's saying like get in i'm gonna

448
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,160
take you away it's really frightening like it's a very intimidating position to try to be coming

449
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:07,200
from it's terrible um especially in this day and age because in every movie or like la law you know

450
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,200
law and order tv show sure someone pulling up in a car and going hey exactly that's exactly so

451
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,800
buffalo bill kind of fucking poisoned the well here for the rest of us because i bet you unless

452
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,200
you know their code word ours was duck tales oh well now that you fucking told everybody

453
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:31,200
what our kid code word that was our code word if our parents set someone to pick us up they had to

454
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,120
give us a specific code word which i am revealing this now uh i think we're safe i think we're out

455
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,880
of the woods they give us a specific code i'm gonna be honest with you guys if someone rolled

456
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,480
up right now i was like hey your dad's having to pick you up duck tales okay here we go man

457
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,560
wow our parents really went to the cryptographer with that one duck tales capital capital d and

458
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:02,480
the l is a one oh you got it perfect perfect swordfish unhackable yeah let's get in what did

459
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,640
you say your name was i don't think my dad knows anybody with that kind of mustache but you said

460
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,720
duck tales so let's fucking roll let's party you either know my dad or you know all about duck

461
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,280
tails either way we are hanging you know what i love is our parents set that up and then we walked

462
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,560
home from school every day so it was like you created a barrier and then you left the gate open

463
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:26,400
what i'm saying is that if you are if you are a child predator in the 90s and you know that you

464
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,080
have to hack that password it's got to be like you get you're walking home and you pull up and

465
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:40,080
you're like hey team and team ice cream got a tail spin muppets muppet babies duck tales yes

466
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:46,640
like our minds from mars yes yes yes yes yes i would get into an unmarked van in venezuela

467
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:53,360
if the person opened the door and said duck tails to me senior senior ducktales oh okay

468
00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:01,760
sure no problem are you gonna chop my head off and whoa you did what life really is like a hurricane

469
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,320
okay okay is that something that everybody had my stranger stranger password suggestion

470
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,800
didn't our parents didn't think that came from like gruff mcgruff whatever his name was our

471
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:24,240
parents the crime wolf take a chomp out of crime bite a criminal literally in west virginia we

472
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:37,920
couldn't afford the illegal wolf i'm i'm dale the justice bobcat don't don't be a pussy fight crime

473
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,800
that's my slogan get in the car coward

474
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,200
not riding over the strangers just admitting your weakness why don't you start hitting the gym

475
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:59,120
oh blast your belts and maybe you can take down attackers that candy does look pretty good

476
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,800
why don't you like candy i'm gonna come at you now i'm gonna come at you now and i need you to

477
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,480
flip me like you flip an attack there was what do you do you guys think there was one kid throughout

478
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:18,480
history that a did go for the candy got the candy and escaped what i'm saying to you is maybe instead

479
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,160
of a always terrible idea to get to go with strangers with candy maybe it's just a really

480
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,160
risky one that you really have to be able to follow through on like what are the house odds

481
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,840
there yes it doesn't there is no candy sweeter than the candy that you snag out of that bear

482
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,480
trap you know you gotta do that like uh that training montage take the pebble from my hand

483
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,000
kind of thing and you got the candy and you're out i think our parent i think we can all agree

484
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,840
that our parents did a bang-up job in every respect of child raising they they succeeded

485
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,360
but i do question the fact that they even had an addendum to the sentence don't get in a car with

486
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:06,160
a stranger unless uh this has been my brother my brother me it's an advice show for the modern era
