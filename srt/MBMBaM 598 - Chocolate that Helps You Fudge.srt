1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,380
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,780
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me the advice show for the modern era

8
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,100
And I am Travis the smooth

10
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,460
I and this is Griffin McElroy the sweet baby brother, but that's not important

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,220
What is important is happy birthday to all the presidents. Oh

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,740
Happy birthday to all of the presidents who all got together and said wouldn't it kick total ass if we all had

13
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,100
The same birthday and we called it Presidents Day and we just ripped shit up

14
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,540
and had ourselves a good time because just a time to put partisan politics aside and

15
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,500
Rip shit up rip shit with parties in politics. Yeah, there it goes

16
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,900
the only political parties I want to hear about are the ones with beer and babes and

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,820
We got a big pile of living presidents to fucking rock out with their cocks out to all

18
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,300
All of them great. No notes. Yep. Well, no, there's lots of real dookie shitheads in there, but I mean

19
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,980
We're out. We're out here

20
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,540
They know how to party unlike any other person on earth because they've know they've had the nuclear codes and so they know they've partied

21
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,420
With the aliens at Club 51. They've got it all baby. Who's all still alive?

22
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,100
I bet it was weird for Abe Lincoln when they gave him the nuclear codes and he's like what the fuck are these for?

23
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,300
What am I supposed to do with this? You'll find out

24
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,140
But they told George Washington, here's the football and he's like what is football? What does that even mean?

25
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,260
It's context. I don't understand any of the words. I'm gonna be honest. I'm confused by the case

26
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,380
It's in is this metal? What the fuck?

27
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,220
Anyway, metal wasn't invented. Well, they definitely weren't making briefcases out of it. If metal was invented yet

28
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,940
Why is he gots with teeth? Thank you. He could have metal chompers like jaws. That's a little

29
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Presidential trivia. It's from you know what it is at that point Justin metal teeth were unprecedented

30
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,820
You know what's funny about the president? Hey Justin, what the fuck?

31
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,060
unprecedented

32
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,500
Cuz he was a president. You didn't have to stop the flow. Yeah, but Justin just went right over it

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,260
Okay, there's two different kinds of bits in this world trap

34
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,780
There's the ones that you drive by and wave at though

35
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,060
There's the ones that are you park and you have a little picnic outside of them, but that was not a picnic joke

36
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,140
He didn't even huff at it or nothing, but if I stop and park the car at your joke

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah, it's gonna make people think that you don't have those all the time

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,560
But with your rapidity, you know what I mean? Yeah

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,840
In quality and quantity, I mean they're all good girl good

40
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Baseline, you know, yeah

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,680
This fucking Wikipedia article with all the presidents and it doesn't tell me which ones have biffed it

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,400
Which one guess who is best and who is unbiffed and it sucks cuz I like want to talk about this

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,520
I want to talk about this stuff. I know Ronald Reagan famously best

44
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Can I tell you them the one that always gets me Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter unbiffed?

45
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Badland hookworms building houses beaten ass beaten ass beaten ass worm ass, you know the good thing about you

46
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,180
Know this thing that I like about the US presidents. What is it? They've all been good. Yeah, no notes

47
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,020
I would say El Presidente you're getting it done. I would say me and maybe you know

48
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Their birth shared

49
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Communal birthdays not the best dated sort of past judgment. Yeah, but I would say a couple of them have been real stinkers

50
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,900
Oh, there are other thing about them is that they're all from Ohio

51
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Yeah, you guys heard this

52
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Cincinnati Joe

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,040
Joe is one of the greatest traveling presidents. Oh, okay

54
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah, we have a president of the rails and then the home president and there's one president that gets out there and gets it done

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,040
It's like, you know how baseball teams have like home uniforms and away uniforms

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,200
We have a home president and away president got away president never gets talked about it on these guys

57
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,840
I'd like to I wish they would get away. Oh, wow, Justin. It's their birthday. It's their birthday, dude

58
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,540
And was that these guys I wish they'd get away from me and my family and my guns

59
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,140
Wait, are they near your family? What president is near your family? I just like him to stay out of my business

60
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,260
You know citizen someone's fucked up guys. I'm still looking at this Wikipedia article. We've had like a group of presidents and

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,820
Most of them are most of them are dead. Yeah. Yeah, so it's like basically

62
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,900
Yeah, maybe this is the most dangerous. I know cops is always out there saying like or jobs the most dangerous. Uh

63
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,620
Uh looking at the stats. I think it might be presidents because we've had almost 50 of them and like

64
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,500
45 of them left a long time ago. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Some of them pretty

65
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,660
Like quickly, I was like in office. Yeah, I'm just saying that's eerie right? What are the odds?

66
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah, I'm finally president

67
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
I'd like to be president someday, but yeah

68
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,340
Do you think my birthday is not that day so like I can't do you are you have been in Ohio for quite a while

69
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,180
That is true. That is true. I do appreciate it. Thank you for that vote of confidence you guys saying I would make

70
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,180
Well, that's the only vote you'd get from me

71
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,060
You're my brother. You're my blood Justin. I would be such a good president brother

72
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,140
Don't you think that I would be a good like first brother black sheep like oh, yeah

73
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,860
That's the one that makes beer or gross peanuts or whatever. These guys are doing

74
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Hey, how dare you assume that if any one of us became president?

75
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,060
I wouldn't be the black sheep, but even if I was president they'd be like he's also the black sheep brother

76
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,160
Thank you very much. I have purple hair Justin. I'm edgy

77
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,140
Okay, fucking jughead. I'm the edgy one. I'm a weirdo. I'm a weirdo

78
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,420
Don't you see that my hair is not a natural human color. It's not a normal color

79
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,820
This isn't a color. I was born without the womb Justin. I chose this

80
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,060
I'm a guy who makes choices. I'm edgy

81
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,300
anyway

82
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,660
Happy birthday, everyone

83
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,840
I do think it is fucked up that this holiday did start off as a celebration of George Washington's birthday, which is February 22nd

84
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
but then at some point people were like

85
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,700
You sorry George. You got to share it. You got to share it with everyone today there. What are we doing this year?

86
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,140
When we sell I'm not gonna lie this fucking sucks

87
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:57,180
Suck shit. Missed it by a day this year. We're almost on top of it again, Georgie boy. I'm so sorry

88
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,780
Happy belated birthday. Happy belated birthday to all the presidents

89
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,020
William McKinley. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, our McKinley-est president

90
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Grover Cleveland?

91
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,580
That was pretty good. Yeah, I do a pretty kick-ass Grover. I do an okay Elmo. I do an okay Rutherford B. Hayes

92
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Can we hear it?

93
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm Rutherford B. Hayes

94
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
And I'm a president

95
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,940
I'm the president that um, hold on

96
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,660
Hold on. Let me Google. Just a moment, please. Uh-oh. I didn't do

97
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Let me see

98
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,260
No, how'd we do just looking over this?

99
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:46,460
Mmm, his critics to write his leniency toward the former Confederate states and his withdrawal of federal support for African Americans voting and civil rights

100
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay, never mind. I'm a big shithead

101
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
I'm a real piece of shit

102
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,260
I'm a real dick. Anyway, happy birthday to B

103
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,100
Can we start this show now?

104
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,420
We already did, bud. This is it. Your whole Rutherford B. Hayes bit is in there. Yeah, I wanted

105
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,380
This is not a bit. I just I saw this earlier this morning on Facebook. Thank you for clarifying that

106
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,140
This isn't a bit, Justin. This isn't a bit. I don't have like a whole bunch of funny things to say about it

107
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,060
I literally just wanted to tell you to and if the listener listening audience enjoys it

108
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,780
That's that's their business. It's not it's not mine. I just want to share with you guys

109
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,300
I saw the most West Virginia. Well one of the most like West Virginia headlines

110
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,540
On Facebook today breaking 13 news has learned that the current and former

111
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,460
Owners of the Charleston Town Center and the city of Charleston are being sued by the developer of the future hotel in the old Sears

112
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,260
Building. Oh boy. It's just that's that's us. That's us there, baby

113
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,100
That's everybody suing everybody in the future hotel of the old Sears Building. Yeah, buddy. I love it

114
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
I wish it was a futuristic hotel

115
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Same thing Justin

116
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,140
Just a big cube

117
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,620
Yeah, I'd love that. Um, I

118
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,820
May I permission to speak from the heart fellas? Yeah, sure

119
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,780
Um, so last week I did a riddle me piss. Yeah, and

120
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,980
Some folks made me cognizant of the fact that I had

121
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,740
Used that in the past episode 511. Yeah

122
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,380
That's not even that long. It's not that long ago. I was flabbergasted to find that out

123
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,140
And honestly, it made me moist and I don't want to obfuscate the point. Oh, no, I'm feeling

124
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,020
very exotic and actually substitute in actually apologizing for something you can't

125
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,620
make up for it by doing a much worse thing. And I want to postulate before you

126
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,480
Listen, honestly, I'm feeling very perspicacious right now. Justin, not at all. I'm a little bit ornery. Is there a way to mute him?

127
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,220
I like it now. I bring you I bring you this corduroy and this oubliette and I hope that you accept this ephemera

128
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,660
As my sincere globular. Okay. And and listen, I'm spackled over here

129
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,040
You know what I mean? And I hope that you all can widdershins me

130
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,420
That we can you know move past this can we just as long as we are lifting the fucking riddle me piss Jersey up to

131
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,020
The Raptors, which is what we're not. Oh, no, no, no

132
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,520
You actually I locked it I super glued it to the fucking ceiling

133
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,940
So as long as we've got those sort of just shut down with a crossbow

134
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,620
Hell yeah, it's falling as long as we got the rig out that we use for lifting jerseys up to the rafters

135
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Can we go ahead and just hook?

136
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,900
Sad libs up on there, too. Oh my god. That was a sad libs. I didn't even notice Griffin. Oh, wow

137
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,500
You know, I guess it just it comes so naturally, you know

138
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:53,420
What sucks is we actually have a real announcement, which is that in our sad sack state last week crying about smartless beating our asses

139
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,300
Up and down the street. We didn't talk very much about our live show that we have coming up this this week. Yeah

140
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,740
Yeah, it's this week. You can get tickets at bit.ly slash

141
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,380

And it's like a very fun time asking has been one this Griffin in very good sales job

144
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,300
So now he really missed it. I he biffed it. I want to say that these things are always wild

145
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,660
They're always fun. The more people that are there

146
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,980
You feel the energy in the crowd. It gets trending people are tweeting about what they're seeing

147
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,980
yeah, we'll have a lots of

148
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,940
Great surprises that tribes been working on and I'm

149
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,980
Fuck I gotta go guys. I'm gonna do a fucking backflip. I'm not doing any no characters

150
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,620
There won't be any Richard stink so that if that's a plus for you

151
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,500
You got that to look forward to oh, you know what I could do

152
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,860
I could do with musical guest and have the video clips play

153
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Yeah, I like that

154
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Please come please

155
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,100
Amanda got mad at us because we didn't talk about it last week when there were only two weeks to push it and we fucked

156
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,420
It up so bad. We feel really guilty. So if you go buy a ticket or two, that would be badass anyway

157
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,260
So this is a this is an advice show, I mean, I don't know how else to say it. Yeah, there it is

158
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,040
You know what? I mean? This is an advice show. Let's lay all our cards on the table. What does it say?

159
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,740
It's an advice show across all the cards gin

160
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
begin

161
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
When you're ready

162
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,660
Now Justin in your own time just if you would do your slate

163
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,780
Please announce who you are. What pieces you'll be doing

164
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,660
Hi

165
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,740
My name is Justin McElroy. I'll be doing a

166
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,700
Place don't say you'll be doing it. That makes it sound a little bit perverted if you could use a different

167
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,220
Yeah, it makes it sound like you're gonna try and have sex. I'll be I'll be humping this question

168
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,020
That's a little bit worse. So I work at a fancy legal office and I have to commute by bus

169
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,980
Say Boston legal we get it. We know where it is

170
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
You work with Denny Crane

171
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
Why do I know that?

172
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,740
There's so much shit you don't know Travis

173
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,060
Because the other day I was talking about how Boston legal and Boston public are in the same Boston verse

174
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,300
But Boston common is not and that makes me really mad. Sorry, go on

175
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Just go on I'm fairly new and not used to the 8 to 5 grind yet

176
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:52,100
So I find myself staying up far too late to be waking up at 645 every day and then getting to work exhausted now

177
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,860
I haven't finished this question, but so far there's a pretty good. Yeah answer for this

178
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,300
Yeah, I have an hour lunch break and really want to take a nap

179
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,900
Yes, would it be inappropriate to stack boxes in my cubicle to hide in and get some sleep?

180
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,380
I worry that someone might see me in there, but I'm just so tired right now

181
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,380
I decay if I can make it through the day, please help us from pooped in Portland now

182
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Listen, I've just been pointed out

183
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,660
Obviously obviously we could say go to bed earlier, but that's not one like that's not fun

184
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,460
And also like when you read when you reach a certain age

185
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,060
No amount of sleep is enough to get you through the day, right? Yeah

186
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
You could go to sleep right after you got up and you'd be tired

187
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,020
and it's also completely arbitrary because you'll also have days where you sleep for five hours and you wake up and you feel

188
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,900
Incredible and then you'll have days where you sleep nine hours and you feel like some sort of corpse person

189
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,580
Because the weird thing is your body has these weird cycles

190
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,420
But you don't fucking know when they are and you're in no control of it

191
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,060
And it's like oh you woke up in the middle one. I'm like, okay. Well whose fault is that?

192
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,900
Yeah, this is why this is why so many people have endorsed polyphasic sleep. Yes

193
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:12,220
Where you'll chunk it out you get some 90 minutes polyphasic sleep is my favorite thing to talk about and never do

194
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,060
Yep, so you do like sleep for 90 minutes and then you're up. Who's that creeper on the house at 430?

195
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,860
Well, it's Justin who's that taking a nap at 1130 during the morning meeting? That's Justin

196
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,220
He sleeps for 90 minutes and he's up for a while polyphasic sleep now

197
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm of two minds in the actual question here and I want you guys to gut check where you're at

198
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,380
I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a nap on your lunch break. That's your time

199
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,540
I think the problem is location location location, right? Yeah, right

200
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:45,280
I think you need to find within any office or warehouse or I don't care where it is

201
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,580
There is a location that somebody knows about

202
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,580
That's like the comfy spot where everyone sneaks away to nap. Well, I wouldn't want a nap

203
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,380
I wouldn't want a nap in the spot where everyone goes to nap

204
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,020
Do you know like I that's not necessarily something I want to share with my peers. Mmm. That's fair

205
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,980
I don't at the same time. I feel like if somebody is ever like, you know

206
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,420
Reorganizing the office and they move a file cabinet and then there's like a fucking

207
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Shawshank Redemption hole in the wall with like some some pillows and

208
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,300
Newspapers in there you they would that is no good man. If somebody's

209
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,620
Nest your Bruno nest has been discovered. You can't stay in there. No nest. Yeah

210
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
It's inappropriate

211
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,860
But I think if you just go to sleep on your fucking desk head down and if anybody walks in and it's like hey

212
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,340
Wake up leave that job. Oh, you know what?

213
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,900
We haven't done this in a while. What would a sign help? Oh

214
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,220
Seeping seeping because that's the problem right they come by they see you laying down

215
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,060
They're like gosh shirking their duties, but if you have a sign that's like this is my lunch break

216
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,540
This is how I choose to use it Derek. Yeah, right. Like what are they gonna do?

217
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Yeah, I ate so fast Eric and I have to sleep

218
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,820
I eat while I type out my reports so that I can have a snooze arena and it says all of this

219
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,820
There's like eight pieces. It's a daisy wheel printer. Just like yeah now all lined up and there's still reading it

220
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,900
By the time you wake up. That was my shit

221
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,260
I would eat lunch while I had like

222
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:28,100
Library duty during like third period in middle school and then when lunchtime came around I could keep hanging out in the library

223
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,220
Yeah, that's a sad story

224
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,060
Anyway, hey, do you guys want to approach the wizard?

225
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,900
Whatever you do. Yes, don't nap in the break room. Well, no

226
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Just stop napping no what

227
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,380
Yes, don't nap get out of here. You're you're up to it. Okay, you're having trouble going to sleep on time

228
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,380
So you can't yeah, it hurts to wake up at 645 you take a nap. You're continuing that terrible cycle break it

229
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,320
All right tired and then go to bed at night. No

230
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,700
Yes, mr. Polyphasic sleep who then turns around says, you know what though?

231
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,900
Hey, forget everything. I said don't nap. No, don't nap. Oh

232
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,580
Justin polyphasic sleep is just grown-up nap time. No, I don't endorse polyphasic sleep. It's just it may sound like you did

233
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,500
Normal time if you see Jimmy Fallon, you've gone too far. Yeah, that's it. Go to bed all the time. Wake up in all the time

234
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,220
Okay, so just just go to sleep at a normal time

235
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,940
Stop napping your day away. Oh my god, if the digital clock has four numbers on it

236
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,260
You know, there's love napping and it drives me fuck love napping

237
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,500
They'll be at my home having a family visit and they're like, well

238
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,540
That's the cuckoo clock on the wall says it's time for me to get my jammies and have a little nap nap

239
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,940
Yeah, and it's like come on, but you're together. We're having fun. Stop fucking napping

240
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,140
But you're willfully refusing to do it so that you can be unhappy for the rest

241
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,260
No, you do it one time and I one time and then you're on a good schedule

242
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,660
I think it's pretty fucked up whenever we're like partying and then you're like we need to eat

243
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,140
We haven't eaten in 14 hours because you won't stop partying and I'm like rude much

244
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Right trying to fulfill your body's needs while I'm trying to fucking party with you

245
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,100
I also when we're all hanging out as a family and you're like, well 730 p.m. Time for beddy-bye and I'm like what?

246
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm Justin's favorite game Justin's favorite game to play when we're all hanging out of this family is he waits until somebody is on their

247
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,740
Phone and then get gets to get this really slam them for it. Like yeah, we're only so rarely

248
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,340
I think that's what gives you guys are addicted to your devices. You're just constantly

249
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,420
Well, I'm just talking to my real friends and the babes

250
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Yeah, okay

251
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
Yeah, okay. So you're going to

252
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,280
Do a wizard of the cloud. I think we should definitely do that. Okay

253
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,640
All right. So this one is sent in by a lot of people. So thank you to everybody for your contributions

254
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,340
It's like they built a human staircase leading up to the Wizards

255
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
The wizard would love that

256
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,000
Yep, what's the pulp no pupit that's where he turns into a boot or fly

257
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,820
So this is how to prank in school school gets boring sometimes

258
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:19,740
So if you want to liven up a few pranks who could blame you? Thank you someone who catches you doing well

259
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,620
No, even that man. Okay. The question is driven and we haven't gotten into I'm sure we will but when it comes to you

260
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,020
Well, they blame you are they lovable pranks or are they like, oh, that's what I think

261
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,980
Well, they they run the gamut trap using your school supplies

262
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,780
It's a fun way to get started or you could just prank friends with food tricks or electronic tricks

263
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,700
Tronic trick, that's great. That's like Mysterio

264
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,460
Whenever anonymous drones involved whenever anonymous is in the news again, like oh shit. They leaked all the Pentagon's shit

265
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,780
I'll be like what an electronic trick. That's a great electronic trick. They oh no

266
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:00,220
Someone stole my identity and took all my bitcoins. What a brutal electronic trick bunch of stinkers

267
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,180
With blockchain it would be really difficult for someone to steal

268
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,060
Yeah, damn, you're right Trev. That's a good enough reason for me to put all my money into cyber coin

269
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Just like a bronze said to do

270
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,460
Yeah, Super Bowl using school supplies replace correcting fluid with lip tint

271
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,220
So there's some fucked up. Yeah white out with oh

272
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:30,540
Lip tint, I guess lip smackers lip smackers thoroughly clean out a bottle of correcting fluid then snip off the brush glue in an old

273
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,940
Lip tint applicator and pour lip tint into the bottle when your friend tries to borrow it. They'll be really confused

274
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,940
I mean that seems like a lot of work for a little payoff

275
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:47,820
Mmm, or even better payoff would be like while your friend's looking pull out the white out and apply it to your lips

276
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,540
Like your friends like what the fuck are you doing? That's way better than your friend like, okay

277
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,100
I guess this isn't white out the best part about that electronic trick is that

278
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:05,260
It definitely is worse for the friend who sees you put white out on your mouth then you the person who just put

279
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,260
Almost certainly extremely poisonous white out on your mouth. That's funny

280
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,100
No, I'm gonna go to the trouble of cleaning out the bottle to put your lip tint in there

281
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,540
Yeah, use it as lip tint. Anyway, make edible school supplies from sugar paste to confuse your friends

282
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Yeah, man, and then you start chowing down on your eraser or paperclips and your friends won't know what's happening

283
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,780
And they won't be your friends anymore. Probably not once they find out that you have been

284
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:38,340
Cooking pencils. I've seen a lot guys. I've seen a lot of these types of suggestions in like Troom Troom vids

285
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,740
and why my kids are obsessed trim trim, you know, they're like, um, Eastern European pals

286
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,560
And they make videos about how to like sneak candy in the school

287
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah, or one where you have to sneak a superhero into a movie theater. And yeah, exactly

288
00:23:53,060 --> 00:24:00,220
I like why we only eat orange things all that, you know trim trim. Okay, my kids just watch a lot of educational stuff

289
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,140
Oh, yeah, this is educational because if you want to sneak, you know, candy buttons in you can make a jacket

290
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,520
Decorated with candy buttons. Yeah, teacher won't know

291
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,460
You could be teaching your kids about cost-benefit analysis to realize that that's a stupid thing to do

292
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,780
But come on no cost of it

293
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,940
They know that the cost of the snacks in the movie theater is ridiculous

294
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,660
so high so they got a far more beforehand and they make a little like a beret out of

295
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
razzles

296
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
A

297
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,060
Never come back. This is a drive-by joke

298
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,740
Yeah

299
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,040
Use clear nail polish to make a pencil useless paint the tip of a pencil with clear nail polish on your friend borrow it when

300
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,880
They try to use it. It won't right. That's perfect. I like that one. That's a good cell phone to a good what?

301
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,140
Self-own. Oh, I think you said cell phone. I thought that too. I also thought that me if he's if you pencil

302
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
If

303
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,280
You had a pencil and you started talking to it like it was a cell phone. That's funny. Come on

304
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,380
Paint clear nail polish all over your friend's cell phone. That's cool. Oh, that's good, too

305
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,060
Then they try to put their finger to it. It won't work

306
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah, or they put it to their face to make a phone call and then they immediately huff it and pass out

307
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Polish on your nails

308
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,660
Your friends like my nails look healthy

309
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,980
Yeah, gotcha. Yeah, stupid. What is hot clear nail polish on your friend's nails and they're like, oh, thank you

310
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:34,180
Add hot glue to your sharpener before letting someone borrow it do people do we're done with pencils and sharpeners and yeah

311
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,520
Right add hot glue to your tablet, but it's school supplied or whatever these days probably

312
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Crank they'd be on the wall. Oh, yeah

313
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,860
I love that shit. Yeah had the crank. I loved that. Yeah. Oh with pencils. Yes

314
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,220
Manual pencil sharpeners. That's what we had to deal with

315
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,340
I had a sharpened a piece of obsidian, but I would use

316
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,820
And my teacher like where the fuck did you get that and I'd be like back off I got it from minecraft

317
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,500
Time to take out your test. Oh shit. Hold up. I gotta go minecraft myself a pen

318
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,100
Yeah, what I dig dig down deep for the flant. I make myself a pencil from my shit a creeper. No

319
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't say that. You don't say that about the janitor. He's cuby and green. Yeah

320
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,260
He's made of cues. Yeah. Yeah now give him up for the grace of God goes out. I don't I don't really

321
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,020
Even if he wasn't made of cubes and green I wouldn't do that. You're exploding

322
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,780
Janitor, oh, I hate that noise. He's making

323
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm not doing it

324
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,700
Make a crayon eraser for a pencil this one if you kill the janitor you get feathers and it's worth it

325
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,860
That is worth it and creepers drop going powder not feather. It's okay

326
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:03,060
What what create a retracting pin with a spring isn't that? Oh, wait, that's what I did. Yeah, you get those wonderful toys

327
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:10,300
That's a great prank cuz your friend will then be like hey your pins broken and you'll be I know I broke it

328
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:17,260
So confuse your teacher. This is a step to pulling pranks in the classroom have mechanical pencils. Let's just do it

329
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,060
Yeah, yeah, fuck it. Oh, no, let's read the bandage off

330
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,500
Why did someone invent a pencil lead destroyer because that's all they are they don't write

331
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,580
They just break and then you put more out and they break again. They made that shit so thin

332
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:37,020
It's so good and pointless. Yeah, it is good for pretending like you're giving yourself like I don't know an injection or something. Yeah

333
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,380
Prank, but you got to make sure you push the stopper down or it fucking hurts

334
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,820
We're getting into the good stuff now confuse your teacher by changing their wallpaper to a screenshot

335
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,140
So that when they try to click the icons, it doesn't work

336
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,060
But I'm sorry if you get caught doing anything on your teacher's laptop

337
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,420
Oh, yeah, you're going to fucking you're going down. You're done. You're going downtown

338
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,320
Ink your sleeping friend if they fall asleep in the library or class dip their fingers in an ink pad or makeup

339
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,140
You can also use a highlighter then tickle their nose with a feather or tissue when they go to scratch their nose

340
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,700
They'll get ink on their face

341
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,380
Why not if you want to help their face if you want to help them get it off try a little hand sanitizer

342
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,860
that's a great point Travis as long as you're

343
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,580
You're cut out the middleman right of the finger and just put ink on your friend's fucking face

344
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,100
Unless you're trying to convince that they got fingerprinted while they were asleep. That's that would work

345
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,220
It's like oh man, you've been gone for so long

346
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,540
They took you downtown and then like a matrix

347
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,700
They just dropped you back off and I think that there's some kind of mechanical worm in your tummy. We gotta get it out

348
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:47,220
Yeah, use a coffee cup to spill water on your teacher. That's what's gonna go over great. That is good

349
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,740
There's a description here of how to create a prank cup

350
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,500
Using cling wrap several layers of cling wrap and a rubber band and the more I read it the more

351
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,780
My brain

352
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,380
Rebels against itself. Yes, it's a it's a feat of engineering that I do not think is possible. But what do they suggest?

353
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,180
What I'm not gonna read it. That's what I'm saying is why no, we don't want to endorse too much

354
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,420
Can I just say a lot of these sound like something?

355
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,780
Have like middle school Travis would do not because he was a creative prank genius, but because he had impulse control issues

356
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,600
Not so much like pranks, but just more like oh, why did you do that? I don't I don't know

357
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,780
Yeah, I don't think spilling water on your teacher is a great prank

358
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,260
But I do love the little tip they've added at the end here

359
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,940
Which is to keep your teacher in a good mood after pulling this prank have a towel and a real cup of coffee on hand

360
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,700
For afterwards. Sorry Dolores. Here you go. Sorry here try yourself up. You look fucking ridiculous

361
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,620
I have access to coffee. So anyway, I got you take it with two creams with sugar. Am I right? Yeah, how about a back row?

362
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,660
Who's going to take a cup from you ever again when they say you do this?

363
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,900
This in feet of engineering that you've used to soak your teacher who's gonna just done an incredible prank

364
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,340
You have undermined any trust that teacher had for you for the rest of the year

365
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,660
You're gonna the next parent teacher conference here

366
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,100
She's gonna be like, listen, they're getting straight A's because of course rule number one keep your grades up

367
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,540
But they're like fucking Loki in here. Actually, you know, it's fucked up. It doesn't say anything about

368
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,500
Guess what? Wiggy house playing a prank on you. Oh, that's right

369
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,140
Because they're gonna have a hard time expelling you when you're valedictorian

370
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,020
Yeah, cover your teacher's desk and candy this prank will actually make your teacher smile

371
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,900
You can't even use candy to make a picture or spell out something for your teacher. Fuck you. Mr. Dennis

372
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,260
But also it's mentos, but it's mentos, baby

373
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:47,540
Fucking that's right. It is mentos in the picture in a picture. I wrote this one. Oh, okay. Hey take two

374
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,540
Textbook pages together so your Frank can't find them use double-sided tape to stick the front page to a chapter to a page before

375
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,140
Your friend won't be able to find it when they open their book

376
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,420
which is fun because they could be like man, why these two pages stuck together and be like I

377
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:09,580
I got really excited while reading about trigonometry and busted one and I'm sorry for that. I

378
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,820
Apologize trigonometry just does it for me. I know how big that triangle is and I guess my gets my noodle going

379
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Put balloons everywhere

380
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,620
Hallways classrooms cafeterias you name it you can even fill a whole room with balloons

381
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,820
People won't be able to move without running into balloons

382
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,280
Hey everywhere everywhere. Hey, um

383
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,020
Jimmy my son, but you seem so tired and stressed. I have a lot of my plate mom

384
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,900
I don't understand the pressure. It started simple. It started simple

385
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,140
I put some clear Nile plush on a pencil and everyone's like you're the prank King Jimmy and then I had to keep escalating and now

386
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
I'm blowing up millions of balloons

387
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,220
So I can what put him in the client the hallway everywhere mom. What have I done?

388
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:00,720
We need to move so I need to move schools mom. I promise. I'm not angry. I just need to know I have a

389
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:07,660
$2,500 charge from Party City. Yeah card. It's out of control mom. Okay, mom

390
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:14,300
I I pranked myself mom. It's okay. The ultimate prank was on Jimmy you pranked your future

391
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
You pranked your way out of that big scholarship

392
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,980
No, this one kicks ass bring watermelons to school. Hell, yeah

393
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,260
Gallagher got him this prank doesn't sound that crazy

394
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,420
But try to get a lot of people to bring at least two watermelons to school then have them leave them all over the school

395
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,140
Your school will be covered in watermelons

396
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,700
Now this assumes that you're of an age to purchase your own watermelons, right?

397
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,980
Because this is this prank carries the much more difficult step of convince your parents

398
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,340
You need to take two watermelons to school. Yeah, well home at

399
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Yeah, okay, but play that out Griffin

400
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:52,420
My mom I need to bring two watermelons to school for home economics. What are you guys doing in class?

401
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,580
What are you using them for chubby twins?

402
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,820
Chubby twin. Oh, this is we're taking care of babies and I got taking care of two

403
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,880
Extremely heavy babies at this our teacher wants that teachers are very specific lesson about responsibility

404
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,940
Yeah, and also we have to provide the watermelons their work

405
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,620
They're in cahoots with gym teacher who wants us to get fucking yelped. So we gotta carry these two big watermelons around

406
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,380
Well, then what do I pay taxes for shouldn't the school provide the watermelons young Jimmy trap?

407
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,700
That's I mean, we know the state of things

408
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,900
If you bring that up to your parents like well

409
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,180
I I just know that when miss Doris asked she was in tears cuz she was like, I'm sorry

410
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,260
We can't provide the melon. I'm sorry. That makes me so sad

411
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,420
Wrap your principal's car and plastic wrap whatever whatever whatever

412
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,100
Use toilet paper to cover the front of your school for a classic prank. Yeah, that's awesome. Why that's a lot of toilet paper

413
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,380
Yeah, well this one get your friends to help you cover the football field in plastic forks

414
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,180
The most trouble I ever saw anyone get in at my high school

415
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,940
Was a group of kids who forked the football field and they forked it fucking good

416
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,580
And like they had to miss like the team had to miss at practice that day

417
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Oh the worst thing that could happen

418
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,580
That's the worst thing that could happen at a high school not the 15 person fight

419
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
I saw on the first day of my freshman year

420
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,620
Well, that's how you I mean count that fast. Why could you even count that?

421
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,420
Well, five of them were teachers who waited in and then I think got caught up in the moment

422
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,300
Yeah, everybody knows that if you get the opportunity to pop a kid. It's like

423
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
So the prince showed up and said

424
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,820
Noble blood breaks to new mutiny and he separated the houses. It was awesome

425
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,660
Hey, here's just one quick question in the community Q&A

426
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,900
Could I go into the bathroom and go on my phone and call 9-1-1? Oh

427
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Could you

428
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:57,660
Way better go in the bathroom and then call your teacher from the bathroom and say like I'm the principal and you're you fired

429
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,340
That's awesome, hey, do you still have that copy of Jumanji in Spanish just put that on anyways

430
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm the principal and I gotta go fart to come and smell it

431
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
That's all time you could do like a

432
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,660
Mission impossible diarrhea poison and put that in the put that in the principal's cup

433
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,420
And then when he's like, oh I gotta go. I'm so sick you go into the principal's office

434
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,100
I was gonna smell my farts, but then it turned into that real

435
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,980
Yeah, and then you get on the secret like Mikey has that gets on the PA and you're like everybody

436
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,980
It's me principal stink and I said we're growing up what we did where? The only way you understand the product

437
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,580
X lax as a magical chocolate that makes people who yeah

438
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:50,620
Do you know how many times we saw X lax growing up as kids being snuck into teachers mugs and yeah

439
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,940
babysitters, yeah

440
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,900
Sandwiches, yeah instantly made them just like poop their brains out forever

441
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:04,420
What's dope works? I never saw anyone in incredible gastrointestinal distress because of like horrific constipation

442
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,660
And then they take X lax and then I like oh

443
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,060
Thank goodness. I'm glad I took that X lax intentionally

444
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,540
There was there was ever like like important business meeting at X lax HQ where they're like

445
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,700
Do we need to get out in front of this? Yeah, we need to we need to start like a public health campaign, right?

446
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,940
We're just like listen. I know what you all think right X lax. It's the diarrhea medicine, but that's not true

447
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,860
We have a lot. There's a lot of benefits more specifically. It's the chocolate that makes you shit forever. Yeah, right

448
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,300
Yeah

449
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:41,300
It's it there needs to be like a tide pod make good campaign where the tide got in trouble because they made the most delicious looking

450
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Candy shaped objects ever and then had to come out and be like, it's not it isn't candy

451
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,580
I know we're having a lot of fun here

452
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,420
But you could die and just have X lax get out there and be like look I know we even made it

453
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:01,900
Chocolate the most delicious thing we get it, but uh, it's uh, please no more jokes. This is serious diarrhea medicine

454
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,020
It's serious. Stop. I just got home from school. And when I told him what you did for a living they all laughed

455
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,940
It's not funny. It's my job helps people. I'm like a doctor. It's extremely serious

456
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:20,060
I make the dookie medicine that helps people can't dookie. I make the chocolate that helps you fudge

457
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,940
Anyway, I've been trying to pitch that as a new slogan, but so far

458
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
This has not been our brightest hour

459
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:40,560
And that's pretty sad considering we're we're only 35 minutes in oh no, okay. Well, let's go to the money zone. That's usually a good palate cleanser

460
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,160
All right, let's shake it off let's get back in the jimmy's out again listen

461
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
We've had a lot of wiggles now. It's time to focus up

462
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,240
We're back into it and it's time to deliver the goods

463
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,440
Justin take it. Don't think about it. Just go take the rock. Okay, a

464
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,640
lot of people use Squarespace these days and they want to use it to make a great website I

465
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,880
personally Justin McElroy have been using Squarespace for the past couple weeks to build a

466
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
website for my wife Sydney

467
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,040
Who is running for the House of Delegates here in West Virginia?

468
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,440
And I built her website with the help of a trusted friend mainly to tell me if the things looked bad

469
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
But I've been he built it and I've been editing

470
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,860
Editing it. Well now I'm sorry, but the story keeps changing

471
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,600
Yes, I feel like there is a shifting the point is I could have done it

472
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,960
Uh-huh. So that's where I got myself into trouble is once I started fooling around with it. I should have been intimidated

473
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,680
It's easy to do you can adjust the things you make a great look at website

474
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,240
So just be clear the fault is not with Squarespace. It is with Justin

475
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,060
And in our stars, yes, and I've built Squarespace websites before I guess

476
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,560
I just had the yips because I wanted it to be really good

477
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,480
Yeah, I mean I wanted to look great, but I should have trusted that Squarespace simplest would make everything look fantastic

478
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,800
That is what they do. So as Michael from from

479
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Drunks and Dragons like help me

480
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,520
Help me to build it. Yeah, and he did you need I could have done it on my own but I

481
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,600
Appreciate do you understand? Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. Like you could have done it, but you got scared

482
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
Yeah, don't get me scared. Don't get me wrong in the ad copy

483
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
It does want us to talk about how easy it is and that you could do it yourself

484
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,480
I could have I should have trusted that is what I'm saying. But at the same time, I really appreciate Michael's help

485
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,640
They offered 24-7 support but not 24-7 emotional support. Thank you

486
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,240
Which is what Justin needed. They don't tell you that the magic is inside you. So Justin could have used Squarespace

487
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,360
But he second-guessed himself and that's why he's here now to tell you don't make his mistakes

488
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,060
Right you be better than Justin use Squarespace yourself, right?

489
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,180
This is your chance to prove that you're a better person than Justin

490
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,480

Justin is of doing the wrong thing then let door-dash do it for you

499
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,060
I mean from now on all of my ad reads are gonna be about Justin being afraid

500
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,080
Cuz I think I fear is a powerful motivational tool, but I don't want to make it about our listeners being afraid

501
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,280
That's gonna use it about Justin sometimes Justin's afraid that he'll forget things at the store

502
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,200
And then he's like, what am I gonna do now?

503
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,580
Oh, whatever everyone finds out that I forgot the snacks and the drinks and the household essentials. Oh god

504
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,080
They're all gonna be so mad at me. Well good news Justin

505
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,400
You can use door-dash and they can have household essentials drinks and snacks delivered in

506
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,160
As little as 30 minutes right to your door and Justin don't be afraid about not being able to connect with the restaurants

507
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,240
You love door-dash. They can connect you with the restaurants you love so fear no more Justin and Justin Justin

511
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,960
Like a cozy mystery that doesn't have any blood or violence in it. Good news. That's a knife

512
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,080
No, well, is that for Justin to wield or the door-dash deliverer to bring?

513
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,040
I don't know that we should say that door-dash

514
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,440
Delivers bring a huge knife to your door when they come to do they won't wield it. They won't have it in their hand

515
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,600
Yeah, I mean that would be ridiculous, you know, would it be in a bag of sorts? So for a limited time?

523
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,800
I mean it could be any job that could be Justin Theroux

524
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,680
They could be talking about Justin Theroux. Yeah, so don't worry about it man

525
00:42:51,680 --> 00:43:00,720
Hi, I'm Janet Varney and just like you I survived high school and we're not alone on my podcast the JV club

526
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,720

We have wasted this world our magic put a storm in the sky that has rendered the surface of our planet

534
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Uninhabitable, but beneath the surface. Well, that's another story entirely

535
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:58,520
In a city built leagues below the apocalypse survivors of the storm forged paths through a strange new world

536
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,120
Some people say that the storm is the only way to survive

537
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Some seek salvation for their homeland above others seek to chart the vast undersea expanse outside the city's walls

538
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,120
And others still seek what else fortune and the glory

Hey Justin speaking of Justin Theroux

542
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Do you want to apologize for when we talked about smart list you talking about how smart list hand the the

543
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Prime Minister of Canada on Justin Theroux. I don't see any problem with that. Well Justin Trudeau

544
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Is the Prime Minister Justin Theroux is an actor who has been in many one nobody nobody at home caught that trap

545
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,120
One thing is it passes that comment from the two of you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

546
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,960
Yeah, if you hadn't realized the error you instantly would have I

547
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Mean that would've been the rest the episode. Yeah

548
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,960
Jennifer Aniston's

549
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
ex-husband

550
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,360
Recurrent husband ex-partner. Definitely. I think she wants to get back together with Brad Pitt last I read I

551
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,240
Don't want to talk about this anymore either some parks and rec. Oh, yeah

552
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,680
He's so good a good turn on parks on a good turn. They had it's not wild though. They had Kamala Harris

553
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,480
So it's like not why it's not wild. It's just that they're two individual human beings, right? Yeah. No, I know man

554
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,480
I know

555
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,400
Like it's just a macro if they had Richard Harris on and you were like they had the vice president of the country on it

556
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,960
It's just a half their name is a different name it's a one name in comma Thoreau and Trudeau is very similar

557
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,640
I mean, yeah, you could rhyme it in a poem. Absolutely. Hey, let's do let's do another question. Maybe

558
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Yeah, sure

559
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,080
Travis I cannot believe you put this next one in what I love listening to your show

560
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,200
However, awesome. Sometimes you fellows use large or unique words that I have to look up. I don't know the meaning irony

561
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,320
I was telling myself. I'm gonna remember those cool words and use them when I can however

562
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,520
I after I close my dictionary, I almost immediately forget those words and then fail to use them brothers

563
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,720
How can I get a cool vocabulary like you? Yeah

564
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,080
That's from vocabulary vexed in Vermont. Yeah, sometimes, you know, you know

565
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,240
we're trying to do the show and you feel that truculence and

566
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,320
You're like, oh, I don't remember and those words can be such a femora

567
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,360
You can't actually do that twice per episode it's illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to be personally you guys are right mean

568
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,080
What my recommendation would be to get a job where you have to talk about?

569
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,960
Everything all the time

570
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,840
yeah, and then eventually you get you start to hate the way that you say it and you think there must be a new way of

571
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:07,600
Saying these things because I hate the way I do it. Yeah, and that's so you inspire yourself to get some some new vocabulary

572
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,800
You know you look for opportunities to use in your day-to-day life. You don't even have to know what it means

573
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,560
That's the beauty of it. If you say it with confidence

574
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
We live in an ever-shifting

575
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,320
Linguist society now and so sometimes you can just say a word with confidence and someone could be like, I don't think it means that

576
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,060
You know like it does now actually because somebody used it on tick-tock and they can't disprove that. It's amazing

577
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,960
Oh to be alive in the world today. Oh

578
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Nothing means anything

579
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:44,280
You should change your life to use the word. So like if you learn a if you learn a new word like

580
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:52,480
Can't even think of any word juice think of any word pal, come on you can do it I use so many early in the episode

581
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,200
Come on

582
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,200
verisimilitude

583
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
from downtown I

584
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,000
Thought it was versus millitude versus. No, that's when you fight millitude

585
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,380
Then you should do things that were verisimilitude would be part of the

586
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,960
You know like you should I know it cuz Richard Donner used it when he was talking about the Superman movie

587
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,240
So like if you're making them really use their similitude like truth to be like

588
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:30,120
I wanted to seek out verisimilitude in the Superman movies a movie about a man who flies backward around the planet. Um

589
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,120
It's just it's it's here Travis, okay, you're gonna feel like a real horse's patoot when I send you my this is my Twitter banner

590
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
Okay

591
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,720
I'm not on I'm never on Twitter in slack. Okay. Okay. Oh

592
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:52,280
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's Superman the holding a banner says verisimilitude. Yeah. Okay, great

593
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:59,880
It's so I'm saying like find a time in a place in the world where that concept would be important and shift your life to meet

594
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,400
your vocabulary

595
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,560
You know, I mean, yeah

596
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,360
But sometimes also big words are like fucking overrated because like there's a word

597
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,240
Pocritudinous means like very beautiful and like beauty and shit. That's an ugly sounding word. It's a gross word

598
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,600
So who needs it just say bodacious way better way better

599
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,760
I think we could you're not gonna say like check out that poker tune in his ass, right?

600
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,800
You're not gonna say that but you know, I also wouldn't say check out that bodacious

601
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,240
Who would I be you wouldn't say you wouldn't say check out that bodacious a but who would I be saying that to Travis in?

602
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,200
My life. Well your son when he's older Griffin. Yeah, I forgot

603
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
So important to build your kids up

604
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,640
Sorry, I

605
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,360
Was saying you would say it to have a bonding moment with your son about a bodacious ass

606
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,920
Yeah, you saw we saw a babe a target. Yeah, and you want to talk about that bodacious ass

607
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,280
Yeah, what you're saying is like he's ready for his first like homecoming dance and you're like sniffling

608
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,280
Yeah, I'm just so proud of you

609
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,360
He's like dad don't come on

610
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:11,080
I'm gonna get me crying if I could say bodacious ass I love you

611
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,880
I love you so much. Dad. I love your bodacious ass today

612
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,400
I know that bodacious ass is the way you say I love you cuz you were raised in a different generation

613
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,440
You're wildly uncomfortable and every time you come in my bodacious ass because you love me bodacious ass son

614
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
But they just ask you to daddy

615
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
I

616
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Interesting

617
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
Yes

618
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,560
Okay

619
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,000
Little caesar's

620
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
not Batman related is

621
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,780
A pizza restaurant where you can get things at a drive through and you drive up you say give me pizza, please

622
00:50:53,780 --> 00:51:04,340
Can I also just say real quick, Little Caesars is a great example of a restaurant where I have no idea where we're at culturally, as to have they turned their shit around, is it still viewed as like...

623
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,540
It was the cheap pizza because you get two, and that's what we had at church all the time. It was always Little Caesars.

624
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,900
I fucking love Little Caesars.

625
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,100
But have they turned it around?

626
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,660
It was the awesome Little Caesars.

627
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,620
Because Domino's did a thing.

628
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:27,620
Yeah, this is interesting. See, that was my supposition, right? When I would get Pizza Hut or Domino's, I would think, oh, I'm really treating myself now because I'm not eating, or God forbid, like a backyard pizza.

629
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,300
Oh my God, who has the money?

630
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,420
Who's got the money?

631
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,460
In this economy?

632
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:42,900
I thought, let the common folk have Little Caesars, but then I tried it recently. It's been maybe a decade. Great. Great quality food. I really enjoyed it.

633
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,300
One of the best sausages in the game, frankly.

634
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,980
One of a great sausage. Not like you're going to get over at Monty's Pizza.

635
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,580
No, no, no, no. You get that crumble?

636
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,700
On 7th Avenue, that kind of crumble.

637
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,980
Oh, no, no, no. That's the shit. They cut the circle into squares. Love it.

638
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,540
Oh, come on.

639
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,780
Oh, forget about it. You throw some barbecue chips on there, you're living the dream.

640
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,300
Oh, now you're snacking.

641
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:01,860
Oh, boy, boy, boy.

642
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,740
You guys are narrowcasting to the people on this show.

643
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,460
Yeah.

644
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,580
To each other.

645
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,740
Sometimes I forget there's other people listening.

646
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:15,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little Caesars unveils a new superhero offering. The Batman Calzoni.

647
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,260
It is Batman.

648
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,020
Yeah, that's my-

649
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,180
That's why you did the Batman theme?

650
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:26,100
Yeah, but the Batman Calzoni. I saw a sign for this at the Little Caesars across from Fantastic Sam's over near the-

651
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,220
Oh, yeah, I know that one.

652
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:36,100
And I was like, I had to, I literally stopped my car to take a picture with my phone because I was like, what? It just said Batman Calzoni $7.99.

653
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:41,220
Now, can I just say that one does not look like a calzone. Two-

654
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,780
It's not a calzone, you idiot. It's Calzoni.

655
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,260
It looks more like Mothman than Batman.

656
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:52,740
Okay, well, like, maybe next time you make a half calzone, half pizza, you'll make it look more like Batman.

657
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,860
I'm just saying that is not the shape of either the Batman or his symbol.

658
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,780
That looks like the Bat symbol.

659
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:06,180
It does not look like the Bat symbol. The Bat symbol is much more oblong. This is a pizza that someone fucked up.

660
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,580
This is-

661
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,260
Okay, so I can just talk about it for a second.

662
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:08,820
Yeah, sure.

663
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:17,460
It's the Batman Calzoni. The Bat signal has been spotted in Detroit, but not the way you'd expect.

664
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,020
This is from MLive.com, which is a Michigan news source, I think.

665
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,940
The Bat signal has been spotted in Detroit, but not in the way you'd expect.

666
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:35,780
It comes courtesy of Little Caesars, which unveiled a super new food item on Monday, introducing the Batman Calzoni.

667
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,780
It's a bat-shaped product.

668
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,260
It's not.

669
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:40,740
Hold on one sec.

670
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:48,260
The bat-shaped product is a buttery-tasting calzone crust filled with garlic white sauce,

671
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:55,780
cheese, and julienned pepperoni combined with a pepperoni pizza

672
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,900
and served with a side of crazy sauce.

673
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,020
I'm staring at this, and the picture you have sent us, Justin,

674
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,180
the pepperoni are arranged in such a way that it feels like a magic eye poster,

675
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,780
and I'm transfixed by it, and I'm trying to find-

676
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,820
But they're perfect.

677
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,300
They are geometrically sort of aligned.

678
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,740
Yeah, I think they knew they were going to take a picture of this one, so they made it look good.

679
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,220
Because it's also really shiny and red.

680
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,300
It's $7.99.

681
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,180
That's a good price. And it says it's going to be available for a limited time, starting on Monday.

682
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,260
Now, normally that would stress me out, but in this case, I think that's probably good,

683
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,140
because I would hate to go into Little Caesars four years from now,

684
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,300
and I'm like, why do you guys have something called a Batman Calzoni?

685
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,260
They'd have to look at me dead in the eye and be like, I absolutely have no idea.

686
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,660
Well, you say that.

687
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,780
We just always had a Batman Calzoni, so we just always have it.

688
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,420
What about Superman ice cream and Baskin Robbins?

689
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,140
That's different.

690
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,700
That's different.

691
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,340
It's different.

692
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,060
Okay, all right.

693
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,420
It makes so much more sense.

694
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:56,900
Anyone can now bring superhero vibes to pizza night by trying the new Batman Calzoni,

695
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,340
said Jeff Klein, chief marketing officer at Little Caesars.

696
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,740
It's the most delicious part of our partnership with the upcoming film, The Batman.

697
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,940
What are the other delicious parts?

698
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,300
What's the least delicious part?

699
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,180
What else you got?

700
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,220
Yeah, what's the least?

701
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,940
Probably all the fucking-

702
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,860
And try the Batman sweat soda that tastes just like the inside of his cowl

703
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,620
after a hard night's butcher roll.

704
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,060
It's fucking gross, but Pattinson insisted.

705
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,380
Try the Riddler press freeze.

706
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,620
The only question you'll have is, why did I get this?

707
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,580
The Batman, which will feature the Cape Crusader uncovering corruption in Gotham City

708
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:37,140
that connects to his own family while facing a serial killer known as the Riddler-

709
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,700
The Riddler?

710
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,340
I've heard of this.

711
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:38,660
What?

712
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:44,180
A serial killer known as the Riddler will be released on March 4th.

713
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,100
What's happening with this crime wave?

714
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,900
There's a serial killer named the Riddler.

715
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,020
Did we name him that or did he name himself Unclear?

716
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,580
Do you guys think if you get killed by the Ridd-

717
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,180
If you live in Gotham City-

718
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:56,420
Yeah.

719
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,820
And then there's like an explosion and you're like,

720
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,100
oh shit, it's a Batman level crime that's happening.

721
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,420
And then the Riddler comes out and kills you.

722
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,420
You're like, fucking fuck.

723
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,820
The Riddles guy is killing me?

724
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,300
Couldn't even be like the Penguin or somebody?

725
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:18,740
That's got to be a really stressful thing about being Batman is when you are fighting the Riddler,

726
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,900
you're like, please don't let me die fighting the Riddler.

727
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,580
Yeah, he can't be like this, right?

728
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,060
Please.

729
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,020
Who killed Batman?

730
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,900
Who finally killed Batman?

731
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,460
Who got him?

732
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,020
Bane.

733
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,220
Oh, okay.

734
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,260
That actually makes sense.

735
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,140
I thought you were going to say the Riddler and I was going to be like, what'd he do?

736
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,380
Riddle him to death?

737
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,020
Yeah.

738
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,500
He riddled him with bullets and he laughed the whole time.

739
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,300
But then we were like, that's not anything.

740
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
That's not how the name-

741
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,300
I'm so excited that I get to watch Paul Dano fight-

742
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,780
Robert Pattinson.

743
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,380
My dear friend, Robert Pattinson.

744
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,180
Who will win that fight?

745
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,300
I have an answer.

746
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,780
Me.

747
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,420
I'm just glad that we're finally, finally bringing the Batman to the big screen.

748
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,540
Yeah.

749
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,380
Let his story be told.

750
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,060
How did he get where he is?

751
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,500
What's his whole deal?

752
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,380
Does he have some sort of butler man who helps him?

753
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,300
I don't know these things.

754
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,980
Are his parents cool?

755
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,620
Are they cool?

756
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,340
What do they do?

757
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:13,620
Right?

758
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,340
Does he connect with other human beings in an easy way?

759
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,380
Right?

760
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,860
Is he cool in social situations?

761
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,660
Is he at all haunted by some sort of dark past?

762
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,700
I don't know.

763
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,540
What's his financials like?

764
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:25,780
Yeah.

765
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,580
Where's he at?

766
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,980
Is he barely getting by?

767
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,020
Finding his free time?

768
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,580
He's going to fight some villains, but also got to pay the bills.

769
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,260
I don't know.

770
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:34,660
I don't know.

771
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,580
Now, it is worth noting that we're having a lot of fun here.

772
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:46,500
But of course, any permutation of Batman that comes up maybe in podcasts or whatever is great.

773
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,100
We're just more Batman stories the better out there.

774
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,420
Thank you.

775
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,460
Yeah, we do love that.

776
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,380
But here's the thing.

777
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,100
Audio Batman, that's where it's at, man.

778
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,420
That's where it's at.

779
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,420
Let me picture my own Batman.

780
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,340
And he's got, oh, he's got long curly blonde hair.

781
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,020
Hey guys, what's your perfect Batman?

782
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,380
This calzone does look like a minstrel pad, though.

783
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,660
And I don't know what they were thinking when they did it.

784
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,380
It's got wings.

785
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,860
Guys, I think I've, can I tell you something?

786
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,140
I had had a pause earlier.

787
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,660
I'm sure Rachel edited it out, but I had to pause earlier because I had a wave of nausea.

788
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,180
And I think that that was caused by the incredible hunger

789
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,020
that I feel looking at this incredible calzone.

790
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,260
You look at this and this makes you hungry.

791
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,020
I want nothing more than to eat this.

792
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,060
I would ravish this.

793
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,100
I find, can I tell you-

794
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,980
Unspeakable.

795
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,420
I find the symmetry of the pepperoni very off-putting.

796
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,260
Why?

797
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,820
Because I know-

798
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,380
It looks fantastic.

799
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,620
I know a human being touched this a lot.

800
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,220
Yeah, that's a good point.

801
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,420
This isn't somebody threw down a scattering of pepperonis.

802
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,380
This took somebody several minutes to-

803
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,060
A human being individually touched each of these ronis.

804
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,300
Yeah.

805
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,660
Why on earth do you assume that the calzone that you would buy at the Little Caesars for $7.99

806
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,580
available without pre-order Monday through Friday from 4 to 8 p.m.?

807
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,380
What on earth makes you think it would look anything like this?

808
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,820
No, I know that, Justin, but I can believe that that is a naturally occurring Batman calzone.

809
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,740
Or I look at this and I say, this is man-made.

810
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:15,860
This is a man-made.

811
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,100
God, I'm so hungry for this calzone.

812
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,100
I think that means it's time to stop the show.

813
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,500
Yeah, yeah, it's calzone time.

814
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,180
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

815
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,220
Oh boy, where to start?

816
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,500
Let's start by-

817
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,580
Again, we fucked up last week by not telling you all about this great virtual live show

818
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,540
we have coming up on the 26th.

819
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,820
Please come.

820
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,020
Man, don't be so mad.

821
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,980
Nobody's bought tickets to it.

822
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,340
We kind of messed up, okay?

823
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,620
It's at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

824
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,740
You can get tickets at bit.ly slash mabim-bam virtual.

825
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,180
It's Friday.

826
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,140
It's this Friday.

827
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,580
This Friday, so come on out.

828
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,460
This Saturday.

829
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,580
This Saturday, so come have a good time this Saturday with us.

830
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,340
It's weekend fun time with your-

831
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,220
Hey, but listen, can you just sound a little like it?

832
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,260
You're selling people on taking in more of you.

833
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,980
Can you just sound like you're not completely miserable?

834
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,820
I mean, I got-

835
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,260
Like you're excited to do it.

836
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,260
I mean, I got some personal stuff going on,

837
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,820
but I guess if you need me to amp up the volume a little bit-

838
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,380
If you could turn it up and turn it on and turn it loose.

839
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:15,780
Yeah, sure.

840
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,620
What's up, sickos?

841
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,180
Saturday, baby.

842
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,460
Bit.ly slash mabim-bam virtual, you fucking freaks.

843
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,340
Yep, there it is.

844
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,740
Oh, that's great.

845
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,180
Our dad wrote a kid's book.

846
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,420
It's called Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding.

847
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:42,660
And if you go to L-I-N-K-T-R dot E-E,

848
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:47,140
that's Linktree with a dot before the two E's slash Goldie's Guide.

849
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,020
G-O-L-D-I-E-S guide.

850
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:55,380
You can see some events that he's doing to promote that book,

851
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,020
and you can go pre-order the book and you should do it.

852
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,700
It's gonna be so cute.

853
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,540
And our dad wrote a book, and we're really proud of him.

854
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,260
So go get his book and go to his book events.

855
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:04,740
I love you, dad.

856
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,340
But just when you thought the best had passed,

857
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,900
we went and saved the best for last because we are doing it.

858
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,260
The 20 Rendezvous Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

859
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,380
Tickets on sale this Friday, February 25th,

860

And listen, yes, masks and proof of full vaccination

863
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,860
or negative COVID test within 72 hours of event are required.

864
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,700
One more time, you gotta wear a mask

865
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,340
and you gotta show proof of full vaccination

866
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,700
or negative COVID test within 72 hours of the event.

867
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,460
But we're coming to your city, maybe.

868
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,860
We're coming live in our own flesh.

869
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,740
Yeah, we'll be there.

870
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,700
For real this time.

871
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,940
Our beautiful human flesh.

872
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,340
I will be there.

873
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,620
We've threatened it a few times, but now we're serious.

874
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,740
This time for real.

875
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:01,700
I do need to say, I will have a sort of proxy homunculus guy.

876
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,700
But it will look just like Griffin.

877
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,100
Except under his indistinguishable-

878
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,300
He's very small.

879
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,060
Except it can't pronounce Ks.

880
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,620
Yeah.

881
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,340
So that's the only sort of problem with it.

882
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,940
But other than that, it's just like Griffin.

883
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,660
It's just like Griffin.

884
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,020
And he's about six inches tall.

885
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,020
He's not really, whoa, he's bigger?

886
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,500
Yeah.

887
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,060
Yeah.

888
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,340
And a little more mostly.

889
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,540
Oh, okay.

890
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,060
He's better than Griffin in every way,

891
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,900
except he can't pronounce the letter K.

892
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,220
Other than that though, one more time, tickets on sale.

893
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,460
Can you tell him to think C and just say a hard C?

894
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,980
Do a hard C or like a CH if that helps.

895
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,300
His mouth doesn't, just can't.

896
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,340
He won't do it.

897
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:36,580
Yeah.

898
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,140
We'll get there.

899
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,940
Tickets on sale this Friday, February 25th at noon local time,

900
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,100
bit.ly slash McElroy Tours.

901
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,340
So you're gonna do that and do the live show

902
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,300
and get dad's book and go to McElroyMerch.com.

903
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,420
We got a new Besties tiebreaker coin

904
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,100
featuring New York Giraffe, the one and only.

905
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,380
So that is at McElroyMerch.com.

906
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,580
We got the pin of the month.

907
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,740
We got the 20 rendezvous pins and we've got the

908
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,900
I'm Not Ashamed of My Clown Husband sticker.

909
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,500
It's all there.

910
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,580
Go, fly you fools.

911
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,700
Go, be free.

912
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,460
Thanks to Montaigne for these for a theme song.

913
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,660
My life is better with you.

914
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,860
It's a track that bumps in the night.

915
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,620
Yeah, bumps and humps and jumps.

916
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,220
Okay.

917
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,180
And I think that's the end of the show.

918
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,980
I'm on Twitch.

919
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,820
Yep.

920
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:25,140
Okay.

921
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,260
And Travis will just say that.

922
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,060
I'm on Twitch.

923
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,420
That's our new wrap up.

924
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,300
Where does that stop?

925
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,100
Where does that stop?

926
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,740
I wonder.

927
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,860
Oh, it sounds like twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

928
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,260
Right, right, right.

929
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,420
But when will you have achieved enough Twitch success

930
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,860
that it doesn't become-

931
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,980
When I'm up there with some of the greats

932
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,620
like Twitch Johnson and Twitch Jenkins and Twitch Johnson.

933
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,220
When I'm up in that echelon.

934
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,300
Twitch and Terry Peters.

935
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:49,460
Yeah.

936
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,740
When I'm up there, I think that'll be the movie

937
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,220
starring Will Smith, Twitch.

938
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,180
When I'm in that realm, I think that's probably

939
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:01,060
where I'll be able to take a year off, I think,

940
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,020
so I can come back hot.

941
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,740
Griffin, I was thinking maybe you could try to like,

942
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,100
instead of the yahoos, which I love,

943
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,300
maybe you could try to like-

944
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,580
Just tell a joke.

945
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,660
You could just like workshop a new Closer every week.

946
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,380
Oh, that's good.

947
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,100
Until you find something that lands.

948
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,060
Like a new bit that feels like a new little mini bit.

949
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,020
Like a sign.

950
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,780
I think that's like undeniably Griffin.

951
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,540
And can I be honest with everybody now?

952
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,380
I've been making them up.

953
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:23,700
What?

954
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,460
My life.

955
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,060
Sorry, that's not the butt I meant.

956
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:27,380
Oh yeah.

957
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:28,900
No, no, no, it's not that.

958
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,140
Okay.

959
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

960
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:31,460
Let me just-

961
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,020
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

962
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:32,260
Sorry.

963
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

964
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:35,940
It's the same way.

965
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,540
Oh, that got me good.

966
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,740
No, no, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

967
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,820
No, no, no, no, you need to really practice this

968
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,540
before you do it.

969
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,300
No, here, okay, say it again, say it again, say it again.

970
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,100
I'll just say it again.

971
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,500
I've been making them up.

972
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,700
This is a MBMBAM exclusive.

973
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,100
I mean, it's not something we should joke about.

974
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:06,020
I've been effectively lying this whole time.

975
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,020
Does your wife Rachel know?

976
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,380
She's the one that put me up to it.

977
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,580
Did it get quieter?

978
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,500
That was a lesser reveal.

979
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,100
Yeah, it wasn't as big as the other ones.

980
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,300
Yeah.

981
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,980
Well, that'll be the bit for this week.

982
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,420
That's what we did this week.

983
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,060
It'll be different next week, so you never know what you're gonna get.

984
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,020
There's no familiarity.

985
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,900
Do you want me to send you a list of words you can use to help apologize?

986
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,100
I want nothing less.

987
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,660
My name is Justin McRoy.

988
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,860
I'm Travis McRoy.

989
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:38,740
I'm Griffin McRoy.

990
01:05:38,740 --> 01:06:06,260
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.

991
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:20,260
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.
