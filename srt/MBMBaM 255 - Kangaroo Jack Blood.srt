1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,200
Hey everybody, it's- it's my brother, my brother and me,

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,080
I found these grubs in these berries, guys. Eat these grubs and berries, we need some protein.

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,880
Awesome, great.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,400
Sorry, I'm looped out from those berries we ate on the trail.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
That was a mistake.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,600
We are currently on the run, our faces ashen like Dekisian children.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,560
We're on the run for the Powerade factory slash gulag slash fitness center

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
that we escaped from after last week's debacle.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
We're trying to make it- we're trying to make it to upper Montana.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,680
We hear there's freedom there.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Raul is- Raul is dead. I bit him to death.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
I bit him and I just kept biting and biting and biting,

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,760
and Justin was like, go Griffin, go, go, go, bite.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,320
Or go, go Chaz, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
And I said, rule out it, in my dog voice.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,480
And then I bit him and he died from all the bites.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,960
Griffin's- Sorry?

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,760
A lot of people have noticed that Griffin slash Chaz-

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, no, I'm gonna explain what happened.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,680
A lot of people have noticed we've been referring to Chaz slash Griffin

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
intermittently as both Chaz and Griffin.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
Here's the really scary thing.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Griffin's human to dog surgery is starting to wear off.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
It's starting to fail.

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,120
It was a spell? Was it a spell?

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,840
I got a spell.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
Some kind of medical spell.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,480
I've got a- I got three paws, I got a foot,

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,560
and half of my face is human, but not the half you'd expect.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
The inside half.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
The inside half.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Oh God, oh God.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,760
My man guts.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
It's a slimy, furry prison, and I hate it.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,920
Please, please set me free.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
So I just do want to say real quick,

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
we are sponsored by Powerade, the thirst, the feeder.

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,640
They've got a lot of different flavors.

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
We're contractually obligated still.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,480
Why did we sign it?

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Why did we agree to do this?

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Why did we sign it in blood?

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,960
I'll tell you the worst-

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,600
It was weird that there was so much chanting and stuff, right?

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
Like that's not me.

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Like now, like looking back on it in the moment,

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,080
it didn't seem weird, but now that I look back on it,

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,560
it seems weird.

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,440
Yeah, like any sort of, from this point forward,

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,960
we gotta be more savvy about this stuff.

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Any sort of professional advertising arrangement

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
that involves the opening of a cosmic portal,

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
we just don't, maybe we pass on that one.

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
I know the money's good, but we just pass on that one.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
I'll tell you the real shame about all this is,

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
I genuinely enjoy the Powerade product.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
I do too.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
It defeats my thirst in a really, really satisfying,

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
in a way that I would say no other fluid is capable of doing.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,880
And now like, I don't know,

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
the whole thing's been solid for me a little bit.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,080
It's the worst part, it's genuinely refreshing.

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
It's genuinely, it blasts my flavor receptors.

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,160
It overwhelms me with its power, aid.

73
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,360
But anyway, this is still an advice show

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
for the modern era,

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,600
and I'm still your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm still your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy,

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
like I said earlier.

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm still just figuring myself out.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm the protagonist in a weird, weird

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,280
Judy Blume slash H.P. Lovecraft book.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,960
H.P. Blume.

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Judy Lovecraft?

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,360
Judy Lovecraft.

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Judy Lovecraft.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah, it was right there, damn it.

86
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
Anyway, it's an advice show, here we go.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Dear sweet, sweet brothers,

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
I need your assistance.

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
I started working in a small office setting

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
about nine months ago.

91
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
I have roughly five coworkers.

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
I've never had any run-ins with any of them

93
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
until recently.

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
One gentleman that has an office two cubicles down from me

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,080
has started snooping around my area

96
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,120
while I'm working to what I imagine

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
is make sure I'm working on some bologna like that.

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
No, you read that so bad.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
Let me try again.

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
You're working on that bologna, right?

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Hey, where you at on that bologna, Steve?

102
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,520
You're still working on it.

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
You're my top man for bologna projects.

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,400
No, working or some, but it is, okay.

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
It is literally, it's already hard enough

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,040
for me to read out loud.

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Do I really have to try to translate in my head

108
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,840
the letters in bologna to bologna like on the fly?

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,480
Like I'm supposed to be able to do that processing instantly?

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Yeah, what is this?

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
The talented and gifted program?

112
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,160
Come on, people.

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
I work hard, but take a minute or two every now and then

114
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,040
to turn on a new podcast.

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Oh, thank you.

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Or take a second to stretch out just like anybody else.

117
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
So how can I look like I'm working

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,640
without this guy coming at moments

119
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,560
where it looks like I'm not?

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
And that's from Annoyed in Atlanta.

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
Is this guy your boss?

122
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
Because you don't say that he's your boss.

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
And if he's not your boss, what's up?

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,760
What's up with that, I say.

125
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,800
Okay, then you just make eye contact with him and nod.

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Like, yeah, I am, do something.

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
If you're on a good website,

128
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
then they'll have a boss button

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
with like a zany picture of a boss next to it.

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:38,960
Yeah.

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
You'll click and it'll look like spreadsheets or something.

132
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
And what does a boss look like, Justin?

133
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
Give me an idea of what a boss in your mind.

134
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
He's got fat head, he's got that weird.

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Oh, so it's a man you're just gonna go ahead

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
and assume it is a man.

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm saying the boss, the stylized boss from the boss button.

138
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
The misogynistic web joke on the web portals.

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
He's got a cigar.

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,640
You know, the Dilbert mini game collection.

141
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
You guys remember the Dilbert mini game collection?

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,520
Oh, absolutely.

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I think I just got put in the video game hall of fame.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
It's in the video game hall of fame.

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
They're speed running it

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
during this year's Summer Games Sun Quick Event.

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm really excited about it.

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
It was a game that I think you got out of a Chex Mix bag.

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Yeah, Dilbert's desktop game was a family favorite.

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
Because we all, as pre-teens, we knew how hard it was

151
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,640
to be a wage slave in middle management,

152
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,000
office drone kind of thing.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
So we really appreciated those gags.

154
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,760
But the Dilbert desktop games had a boss button on it.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,720
But it would turn your desktop into spreadsheets,

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
which was good.

157
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,640
But there were still some Dilbert touches.

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't know how you would explain to your boss,

159
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
well, yeah, it's a Dilbert-centric spreadsheet, you see.

160
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,920
I got a theory I'm working on,

161
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,560
that the way we improve business is Dilbert.

162
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,960
I got some Dilbert futures that I'm looking into for investment.

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
Listen, boss, we need to invest heavily in Dilbert.

164
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,160
Please understand, these are Dilbert stickers

165
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
that are stuck permanently to my monitor.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,520
I can't get these things off.

167
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
They're all over my work.

168
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
They were here when I got here.

169
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,920
Here's a quick clip from the GameSpot review

170
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,160
of Dilbert's desktop games.

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
This reviewer finds CEO Simulator

172
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,320
the most disappointing of the functional actual mini-games.

173
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,120
What was promised to play out like a business simulator

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
is really nothing more than an effort

175
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
that can best be described as watering a plant

176
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
to see it bloom a huge but unimpressive flower.

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,640
Burn it down. Burn that game down.

178
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm canceling my reservation at the electronics boutique.

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm going to Babbage's,

180
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
and I'm going to have a firm conversation

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,200
with the manager there.

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
It's hard for me to advise in this situation

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
because I'm just so incensed at this narc,

184
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
at this work cop.

185
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Here's the thing, Griffin, all you need,

186
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,080
because this is the worst way this could play out, right?

187
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,360
Like the best case scenario for this snoop person

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
is they see you doing some non-work related activity.

189
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
They go tattle, like a little tattle baby,

190
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,400
and then the boss comes and you're back to working

191
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
and you're like, I don't know what he's talking about.

192
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
Maybe I checked my phone

193
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,120
because I'm waiting for a call from my father,

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,400
but is that it?

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,240
Is that what you're talking about, Steve?

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
And then Steve looks like an asshole.

197
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Unless Steve is like snapping paparazzo pictures of you,

198
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,400
like Googling your own name,

199
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,240
I think you're probably going to be fine.

200
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
As long as he's not like your boss.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
If he's like your supervisor

202
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
and he's trying to get like a gotcha moment,

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
you need to find a new job.

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
It's kind of like you're living in Utopia,

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
the television show that was short lived

206
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,520
but beloved on its time on this earth.

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
By two thirds of the world's population

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,840
as represented by this podcast.

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,360
Why would they cancel the show

210
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
if two thirds of the world was watching it?

211
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
The guy was so deep.

212
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
Do you guys want to know who?

213
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,640
Yeah, please.

214
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Oh wait, one other thing.

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
This reviewer and the friend

216
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
that introduced this game to this reviewer

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,840
have, it's written like this.

218
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,280
This reviewer and the friend

219
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,120
that introduced this game to this reviewer

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
have always been fans of Scott Adams' brainchild.

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
Therefore, it was much to this reviewer's delight

222
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
when given the chance to play the game

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
that he more or less sanctioned.

224
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,640
Oh boy.

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,840
Yahoo would be excellent.

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,560
Okay, here it comes.

227
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
This one was sent in by level 9,000.

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,240
Yahoo answers user Drew Davenport.

229
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,960
I forget all of his honorifics.

230
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Thank you, Drew.

231
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,800
It's by an anonymous Yahoo user who asks,

232
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
I want to become a freelance spy and have an agency.

233
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
How do I get missions?

234
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Brother, if you can figure that out,

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,600
you let me know.

236
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,400
You're talking right to 14-year-old Travis.

237
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,880
Slash 30-year-old Travis.

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
Slash the 14-year-old Travis

239
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,320
that lives in 31-year-old Travis

240
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
and wears him like an exoskeleton.

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,840
Man, there's a lot of exoskeleton talk in this area.

242
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Is this something that we're all really struggling with?

243
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
Because if so, we need to form some sort of support group.

244
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,280
How do you get missions for your freelance spy agency?

245
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,520
Let's go ahead and assume this person is 14.

246
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

247
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah, right.

248
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
So mean spy.

249
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
So I guess it depends on what kind of spy you want to be.

250
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
Because there's like two or three different kinds.

251
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
You've got like your James Bond,

252
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,840
who's like your smooth kind of cool person.

253
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,920
Okay, I was thinking more like Halloween candy was stolen

254
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,080
from Jennifer and now we're going to track it down.

255
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
Although that's more the attack.

256
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
It's me.

257
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,160
Smooth, cool person, Bond.

258
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,760
James Bond.

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
What is that?

260
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm trying to break down the classifications.

261
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
I haven't come up with labels or anything yet.

262
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,520
You've also got kind of like your robber spies, right?

263
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,800
Like your cat burglar spies.

264
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,080
But those are just cat burglars.

265
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
A spy is a very specific gig.

266
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
And it's not a-

267
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I would say like a, what's his name?

268
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
The Tom Cruise from those ghost protocol movies.

269
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah.

270
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,280
The Mission Impossible movies.

271
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Yeah, he's a spy.

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
There's Sutterfuge and Subtlety

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,520
and all kinds of sub-based words.

274
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,560
But I would say that he does a lot of cat burgling-esque stuff.

275
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,840
He lowers it on wires.

276
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
He kind of like wears masks, spoiler alert.

277
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,080
Are the Fast and the Furious crew spies?

278
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,400
I would say that they're spies by the later movies.

279
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,200
When you get into like the six, sevens, and eights,

280
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,200
they're contracted by the company.

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
The forbidden Fast and Furious, Fast 8.

282
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah, the non-canonical.

283
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,960
The Christmas special.

284
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Hey, we gotta steal Santa's sleigh.

285
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,960
It's armed with nuclear devices.

286
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,880
We gotta steal Santa's sleigh.

287
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,600
You got it.

288
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Saddle up, one last ride.

289
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,400
The Fast crew will return in Fast 9.

290
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,880
You literally just said it was your last ride.

291
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm currently watching Fast 5.

292
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
Quick diversion for Fast 5.

293
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,520
Like right this second?

294
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Objections?

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
Yeah, it's better than this.

296
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm currently watching-

297
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,760
No, I'm currently, what I mean by that is

298
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
I have a baby, so I watch it in 15 minute increments.

299
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm like literally, I'm reading Fast 5 chapter by chapter

300
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,800
is basically what I'm doing.

301
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,840
I've been watching Fast 5 for two weeks.

302
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
So I've had a lot of time to think about it.

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,840
The flip that the special agent The Rock makes

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,960
is basically just the most insane thing

305
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,400
I've ever seen on a television show.

306
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
I think he enters into a fugue state,

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,840
if I remember correctly.

308
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,600
Like does he get hit on the head and forget what morals are

309
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
is what I remember happens in the movie.

310
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
No, he just decides that instead of capturing the criminals

311
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
that he was sent to capture,

312
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
he's gonna kill a drug dealer on foreign soil.

313
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Like that's what he's gonna try that instead.

314
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,440
Like not even capture this dude.

315
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
He's just gonna go kill this drug dealer instead

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,280
with the criminals.

317
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,960
I've seen up through Fast 6 and they all bleed together

318
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,960
so much I can't remember movie to movie

319
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,040
what happens in which movie.

320
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,320
I just remember it as one kind of like Katamari Damacy.

321
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
It's all just rolled up into one big ball

322
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
of Fast and the Furious in my head

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,080
and I cannot separate out individual storylines.

324
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,240
Right, well that's the, it's all occurring simultaneously.

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
Yeah, they drove so fast that they broke the time barrier.

326
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,080
Time no longer works in the Fast 5 universe.

327
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
That makes so much sense.

328
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,680
How is this person gonna get missions?

329
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
The Furiverse.

330
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
The Fast and Furiverse.

331
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,360
How's this person gonna get freelance spy missions?

332
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,400
I feel like there's probably a website.

333
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,600
Craigslist?

334
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
Something like Daniel Craigslist.

335
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,200
That's good.

336
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,880
Thanks, excellent Travis.

337
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
If I were to, I mean I've written some spy fiction,

338
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
a series of novels titled Grant Andrews Kid Cop

339
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
that I think might be able to shine some light in this.

340
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
And in my-

341
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
Published by Rock Books, isn't it Griffin?

342
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,960
In the seminal chapter, the beginning,

343
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,920
the bestseller, Grant Andrews Kid Cop, no subtitle,

344
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,240
he just starts doing the cop's job for them.

345
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
Right, like they find a bomb in a bank

346
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,280
and he just takes it and he takes it to the park

347
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,200
and he throws it in a pond

348
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,360
and then when it detonates, nothing happens

349
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
and then he gets to be a cop for that.

350
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,640
So it may be, if you wanna be a kid spy,

351
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,400
you just start spying and then the cash flow will come later.

352
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
Don't worry about the cash flow now.

353
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
Well Griffin, do you think that with that advice,

354
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
do you think you start spying like on neighbors?

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,280
Like you start small and you kind of build up

356
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,280
to kind of spying on international heads of state?

357
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
If you're gonna go to town, you go into Lincoln

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
and you drive that Lincoln to Abu Dhabi or something

360
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
and then you just start spying on, you know.

361
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
So the first thing you need to do is get to Abu Dhabi.

362
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Yeah, easy.

363
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,560
And then just start spying on diplomats.

364
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,960
Yeah, just start paying, you keep saying spying

365
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,480
and spying is, I feel like you're saying it

366
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,200
like it's a bad word.

367
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,360
Just pay attention to what other people are doing.

368
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,640
Observe, observe.

369
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
Pay attention to what other people are doing

370
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
in their private times when they don't want you here.

371
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,840
Wait a minute, what if the dude

372
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
in the first question asker's office

373
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,720
was in like very, very basic rudimentary spy training?

374
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Oh my God.

375
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
He was in like, he was in remedial recon.

376
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,480
Yeah.

377
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah, exactly.

378
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,200
Grant Andrews job cop is actually,

379
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,080
oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

380
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
I wrote that one already.

381
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
That was the fourth book in the series.

382
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,640
Information Gathering Basics, otherwise known as 411101.

383
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm at work and I just ordered two medium pizzas.

384
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,280
Brag.

385
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,640
I would love that right now.

386
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Cause I want a pizza.

387
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,760
It's 11, it's 11 in the morning.

388
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
No, it's 1121.

389
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
We're cruising up on pizza time.

390
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay.

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,640
Raise your hand if you've been up since 530.

392
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,000
It's pizza time.

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
I want a pizza.

394
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,840
There was a deal on Pizza Hut's website.

395
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,800
When it gets here,

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,480
I fear the 13 people in the office with me will want some

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
or at the very least harshly judge me

398
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,760
for having ordered two pizzas for myself.

399
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,520
How could you fuck this up this bad?

400
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm happy to share,

401
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
but I don't want to send out an email to everyone

402
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
letting them all know that some of them could get a pizza.

403
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
They're quick.

404
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,720
And I've already eaten my fill.

405
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
You just toss in the scraps

406
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
and let them fight over it for your music.

407
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,760
No, I believe I have room for one final pepperoni.

408
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,880
Slide it between my slippery grease stained lips.

409
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,800
Deborah, kill Steven for this slice of cheese pizza.

410
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
Have I made a horrible mistake?

411
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,440
Yes.

412
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,080
What would you do if you were in my position?

413
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,400
Quit.

414
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,200
That's from Andy.

415
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,440
I wouldn't be in your position, Andrew.

416
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,840
That's, that's, that's like basic.

417
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,680
That's basics like classroom, bring enough gum, homie.

418
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
Your only chance now is to throw some sort of

419
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,600
survivor reward challenge there away

420
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,720
and call it some sort of like company wide bonding activity.

421
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,040
You could also, when the pizza delivery person shows up,

422
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,760
accuse them of being a liar and send them away.

423
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,480
That I didn't order.

424
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
Is this some kind of prank?

425
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
Who would order just two medium pizzas

426
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
for an office of 14 people?

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
Get this garbage out of here.

428
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
I like the idea that,

429
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
I like the idea that this person asked this question

430
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,400
and just cannot act until they've heard back.

431
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,480
The pizza's just molding on their desk.

432
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
No, don't you touch it.

433
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
Can you say it's your birthday

434
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,560
or perhaps some other very personal holiday

435
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
that's only for Andy, just an Andy specific.

436
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,880
Maybe, maybe I just got a vasectomy

437
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
and so I'm having myself a little pizza party for myself

438
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
and you can have my leftover vasectomy pizza

439
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
if you want, I guess.

440
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
It's a very, this is about as personal as a pan pizza gets.

441
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
I thought I deserved a slice for a slice.

442
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,080
Could you stack the pizzas, the two pizzas on top?

443
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh, here we go.

444
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,040
To make it look like you just ordered yourself

445
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
a double decker pizza.

446
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
It's new from Pizza Hut.

447
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Oh no, this is just a pizza sandwich.

448
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,080
You don't understand.

449
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,040
This, flip it upside down, you got calzone.

450
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,240
There you go, now you're working with fire.

451
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
Oh no, I just ordered an overfilled calzone.

452
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,600
I see, so take, dismantle one pizza

453
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
into its constituent slices.

454
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
Put all of those on top of the other pizza

455
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
in a footloose and fancy free manner.

456
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
Then you fold that pizza inside.

457
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Now it's secretly, shh, shh, shh,

458
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,920
tell no one there's another pizza up in here.

459
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,400
And then you close that over and all of a sudden

460
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,560
it's just a big calzone for one big boy

461
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
and that's you Andy, happy vasectomy day.

462
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,720
I cracked it.

463
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,560
You get a plate, okay?

464
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,600
You scrape all the cheese and sauce and toppings

465
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
onto the plate off of both pizzas

466
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
and you tell people you're on Atkins

467
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
and this is the only way you can get full

468
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
is to eat the top of the pizza

469
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
because it doesn't have carbs.

470
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,680
And then later, the next day,

471
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,280
you come into the office and you say,

472
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
you're trying a new thing.

473
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
It's called reverse Atkins and you eat the crusts.

474
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,400
Wait, so rather than enjoy your pizza,

475
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,760
you're now forcing yourself to eat a big, awesome cheese.

476
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
You're still enjoying your pizza,

477
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,680
you're just getting it in installments.

478
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
It's an installment plan.

479
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
Like the way I'm watching Fast Five.

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,960
Hey Mark, I need to use the company centrifuge real quick.

481
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
I need to divide these two pizzas up

482
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,120
into their molecular components.

483
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,760
Hey, we still got that large Hadron collider downstairs, right?

484
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,080
Right.

485
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, I need to borrow it for a minute.

486
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm gonna smash these two pizzas together

487
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
and just eat the carbon.

488
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
I'm gonna reduce these down to a carbon tablet.

489
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Oh, created a pizza black hole in the basement.

490
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
It's the most radical singularity.

491
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
Probably the best thing you could do with the second pizza

492
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,800
is to take seven of the slices.

493
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,560
Assuming you're leaving one extra for yourself

494
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
because after I finish a pizza,

495
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,920
I always think I could use one more slice of pizza

496
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,560
and now you have that.

497
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,640
So you have seven slices to divide up.

498
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,440
Take, put one slice on each of seven desks,

499
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,440
make no mention of it

500
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,960
and watch that office rip itself a fucking part.

501
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,400
Where did you, was there pizza?

502
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
Where did you get pizza?

503
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,320
Where's this pizza from?

504
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,680
Who got, where did you get pizza?

505
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
I want some pizza.

506
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,720
Fuck, it'll be Lord of the Flies in there

507
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,760
by the time Tammy comes back from her lunch break.

508
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,800
It'll be a nightmare.

509
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
I haven't worked in an office in my life.

510
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,560
It's, but it's like this though, right?

511
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,720
Like if one person has one tastation,

512
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,680
it's the end days.

513
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,040
I also, so the office I worked at was with the theater.

514
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,120
So there were also lots of like actors

515
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,640
and like young company members and everything.

516
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
So if somebody ordered a pizza,

517
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
you could watch them like hyenas

518
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
waiting for the person eating the pizza

519
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
to be done with the pizza

520
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,160
to see if there were any pizza remains.

521
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,560
So there was a lot of like-

522
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,240
Pizza smells in the air.

523
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,920
Are you done with, I see that there's some like pepperoni

524
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,760
stuck to the bottom of the box.

525
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
Can I eat those now?

526
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
Can I put my nose in your greasy mouth?

527
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,280
Every office has a weird DMZ, Griffin,

528
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
to educate you about this.

529
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
Every office has a weird food DMZ

530
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
where if you have a pizza on your desk,

531
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,840
no one will touch it.

532
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
It would be weird.

533
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,400
There is a table or a region in your office

534
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
where if you put a food product, it will disappear.

535
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
Have a pizza, give a pizza,

536
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
and eat a pizza, take a pizza.

537
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,320
Exactly.

538
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
This Yahoo that I'm going to read now

539
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,640
without permission because I don't need it.

540
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
Well, I want to read this one first.

541
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,040
It was sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

542
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,440
Thank you.

543
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
Just to continue the trend of us

544
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,520
eating the snake's tail that is Yahoo Answer.

545
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,000
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Zach K who asks,

546
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
who is your favorite McElroy?

547
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,160
Now, this is in entertainment and music celebrities.

548
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,080
Did you guys hear that?

549
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
Did you guys hear what Yahoo called us?

550
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,000
Zach says, mine is probably Justin,

551
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,120
but it's hard to say.

552
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,840
How about you?

553
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,900
Yeah.

554
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,160
And then this was sent in actually,

555
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,840
this was asked four years ago.

556
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
So we, I mean, we were just starting out.

557
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,480
I was evolved since then.

558
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,520
You can't compare Justin.

559
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah, I was gonna say,

560
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
we're completely different people.

561
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
I've got three new exoskeletons since then.

562
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
Yeah, that's true.

563
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
Samantha G responded and said,

564
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,200
what is a McElroy?

565
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,840
There it is.

566
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,760
That's appropriate.

567
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,680
That's the question right there, Samantha.

568
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,160
Woof.

569
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,520
Have you figured it out?

570
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,000
You tell me.

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm right to the quick.

572
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
How about this other Zoe Kinski one though?

573
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
It's asked by Yahoo Answers.

574
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
Nope, something went wrong.

575
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,600
Can't tell you who asked it.

576
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,800
Jerrsh asks.

577
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,760
It's me, Jerrshi.

578
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
Jerrshi asks,

579
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
what could happen to me if I mix my blood with kangaroo blood?

580
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
Please, I want to know.

581
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
That's one of two things.

582
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,760
One is you get super jumping powers.

583
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,960
Absolutely, or pouching powers, punching powers.

584
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
This is where you get the second option,

585
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
which is you start to take on physical characteristics

586
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
of a kangaroo.

587
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
So one is like you get kind of like

588
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
just the powers related to though you still remain human.

589
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,800
Okay.

590
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Second is you start to do like a fly

591
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,760
or island of Dr. Moreau style like transformation.

592
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Can I-

593
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh, the third option is you die.

594
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
Full body death.

595
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Just full, just complete full body death.

596
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,080
From-

597
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,640
Your soul escapes from your mortal coil.

598
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,120
From toe to tip, from stern to bow, fully dead.

599
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,000
But you know what?

600
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
There is no science without risk.

601
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,240
That's a good point.

602
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,960
Isn't this what Kangaroo Jack was about?

603
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,200
Yep.

604
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
I didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure-

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,560
No, Kangaroo Jack was about convincing a nation

606
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,640
that it was about a talking kangaroo

607
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,360
when it was not at all about a talking kangaroo.

608
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,920
No, it was about-

609
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,520
You're still really raw about this, huh?

610
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,480
It was about apartheid.

611
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,720
Just like Jaws isn't a movie about a shark.

612
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,360
It's about apartheid.

613
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
Kangaroo Jack, it's about apartheid.

614
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,000
A lot of movies about apartheid

615
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
and a lot of people miss out on that

616
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
because it's like sometimes it's just below the surface,

617
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
much like Jaws himself.

618
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
And Kangaroo Jack, nobody actually saw that flick

619
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,160
because they're like, they saw the trailers

620
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,560
and they said, I would rather do something else.

621
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,320
I've had my fill of Kangaroo Jack, thank you.

622
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,720
I think I get it, but you don't get it.

623
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
Because there's a lot,

624
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,320
that movie had a lot of really, really poignant stuff to say

625
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,560
about R.E. apartheid.

626
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,040
Excuse me, there's a Kangaroo Jack 2.

627
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,640
Alert, alert, alert.

628
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,160
There's a Kangaroo Jack 2.

629
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,920
It's a full-length animated film called Kangaroo Jack Good Day USA.

630
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Alert.

631
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,520
Does it mention why the kangaroo speaks?

632
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
That'd be a pretty bad movie, Travis.

633
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
Don't you think it would be a bad movie

634
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
if the protagonist didn't speak?

635
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
It would be more fun than what Kangaroo Jack actually was,

636
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,080
which is a kangaroo that like accidentally steals a bag

637
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,480
full of money from two bumbling idiots.

638
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
And then they chase the kangaroo through the desert.

639
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
There's no rapping, there's no dancing,

640
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,560
there's no talking as would be indicated by the trailer.

641
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,920
So no, Griffin, I think it would be a pretty good movie.

642
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,200
Thank you very much.

643
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,240
As near as I can tell, he does speak in the animated film.

644
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
I mean, he has an actor playing him.

645
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,600
Let's put it that way.

646
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
But that could just be making kangaroo noises.

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,800
That's true.

648
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,200
This is a good, I don't know why you pay somebody to do this.

649
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
Normally you just get like whoever's around.

650
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
Like Jimmy the intern.

651
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,720
Like, Jimmy, let me hear your kangaroo.

652
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
That's pretty convincing.

653
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
I guess my question is like,

654
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,080
why would they get an Australian animal

655
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,400
to do this movie about apartheid?

656
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm not sure Kangaroo Jack G'day USA is about apartheid.

657
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
No, no, no, the squeak will is not about apartheid,

658
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,960
which is weird.

659
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
That's why that one actually has a very low score

660
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,280
on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.

661
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,200
And it's just because people like the people

662
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
who saw Kangaroo Jack the first one were moved by it.

663
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
It was an important film that came out at just the right time.

664
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
And then the second one came out

665
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,480
and I think he played basketball or something.

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,560
And it was like, I don't, it's weird.

667
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
It's like if they made a Schindler's List too,

668
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,400
but like he opened up a yogurt shop or something.

669
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,520
And it was animated.

670
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,800
And it was animated.

671
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,840
Also, he's a kangaroo.

672
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
Alert, alert, I have a nine out of 10 review

673
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
for Kangaroo Jack G'day USA from an IMDb user.

674
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
Here it is right now.

675
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,400
This is from the reviewer 1204.

676
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,280
Just today, I've seen this movie on Cartoon Network by surprise

677
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
and knowing Kangaroo Jack,

678
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,760
I risked watching it to find it isn't utter crap,

679
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
which Cartoon Network and Nick often put on television.

680
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
As it was on Cartoon Network,

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,680
I found and knew it was going to be an animated course

682
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
on the KJ franchise.

683
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
First course this evening in a moose bush, if you will.

684
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,320
Kangaroo Jack 2, ballin' in the USA.

685
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,280
I watched this beginning to end

686
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,600
and found it very good in overall

687
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
and had no flaws to truly point out.

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,640
There were laughs.

689
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
Why wasn't it 10 out of 10?

690
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,600
There were laughs course, as well as other things in the movie.

691
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,080
The movie's beginning, I roughly missed though

692
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
and was led up into 10 minutes or so into the movie

693
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
and I really wouldn't want to watch it again

694
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,880
just for those few minutes.

695
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Wait, okay.

696
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,000
This person bobs and weaves between, eh,

697
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,680
and it was awesome so quickly that I'm like,

698
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,160
I either want to know why it wasn't 10 out of 10

699
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
or why it wasn't four out of 10.

700
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,280
Small disclaimer, I am a huge Scott Adams fan.

701
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,480
That's neither here nor there.

702
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
I just wanted to get it out there.

703
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
I truly hope they make a sequel or even a television series.

704
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,640
I'd watch it.

705
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
And I'm sure enough demand would be available.

706
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,320
Until then, I can only hope or even write.

707
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,400
Maybe a fan fiction is due, eh?

708
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Well, that's my comments.

709
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
It's time to run off for me.

710
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
It's time to die.

711
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,120
You know, there's not enough internet posts

712
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,960
where people are like, well, I've typed long enough, friends.

713
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,360
I must, uh, TTYL.

714
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,400
I must retire to my boudoir for the evening,

715
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,480
but thank you for joining me for my IMDB review

716
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
of Kangaroo Jack.

717
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Like, he would stop the sentence before that

718
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
and so he'd be like, there's gotta be more.

719
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
My concubines have drawn my evening bath.

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
I must, I must away.

721
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,960
Time to report to the White House for duty.

722
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,160
Goodbye, everybody.

723
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,840
I believe Jackson has your petticoat, Jackson.

724
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,000
Fetch this gentleman's outer garments.

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,160
I, I have expired all my energy for the evening.

726
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,520
Sir, you exhaust yourself writing these reviews.

727
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
They must know, Jackson.

728
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,560
They must know.

729
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,920
Sir, you're killing yourself.

730
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Sir, think of your consumption.

731
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
Come for a rest in the drawing room.

732
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,240
Nay, I say.

733
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,560
I have so little time left on this earth.

734
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,400
I must get the word out about Kangaroo Jack to good day.

735
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,800
To good day, USA.

736
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,200
I am, there's a, there's a lot of discussion

737
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,280
about this film on the message boards of IMDB,

738
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,720
by which I mean one post titled Gay Day USA.

739
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
That's how my mind read it before I look closer.

740
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,800
It's always funny when I barely glance at things.

741
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,160
So somebody was like, well, that was funny

742
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,880
what just happened to me.

743
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,640
I've gotta get this on the internet.

744
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
You know who would love this?

745
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,640
Everyone.

746
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,760
This episode has been a real treatise on modern criticism.

747
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,520
You think about it.

748
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,320
Who's doing it best?

749
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,440
Who's doing it right?

750
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
Chelsea Loves Reliant K is her name.

751
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
Should we take it to the money zone?

752
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,720
Yeah, I think we should.

753
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
What are we on the money zone today, Travis?

754
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,040
Well, first, my brother, my brother and me are sponsored by Harry's.

755
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
We've talked about Harry's.com before,

756
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
and we'll talk about it again right now.

757
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Harry's.com offers razors that are so high quality

758
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,000
that it will blow your face off, except not.

759
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,040
Don't say that.

760
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
That's not a thing they want to be said.

761
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,320
It'll make your face look awesome.

762
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,800
How about that?

763
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,840
Is that better?

764
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,920
It's better for your face and your wallet.

765
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
That's the twist.

766
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,600
What about my legs and my butt?

767
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280
It's good for your legs, good for your butt,

768
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,680
good for your pits, good for your forearms,

769
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,440
good for your unibrow, good for the back of your neck,

770
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,800
good for your back.

771
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,280
What about the inside of my dog body?

772
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,560
Done.

773
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:44,880
Okay.

774
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
All of it, all of it.

775
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,720
And here's the thing, Griffin.

776
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
You can get a starter set, which includes a razor,

777
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,800
foaming shave gel or shave cream,

778
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,400
and three razor blades, plus free shipping for $15.

779
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,320
Oh, shit.

780
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,800
If you've ever bought a razor in a store before,

781
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,520
you know how ridiculously inexpensive that is by comparison.

782
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
You could expect to spend that much

783
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,160
just buying a set of blades.

784
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,560
Sorry, Trav, nothing doing.

785
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
Still too much.

786
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,880
Still too much?

787
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Still too expensive.

788
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Okay, Justin, what if through some, I don't know, magic,

789
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
some kind of financial wizardry,

790
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I was able to shave one third of the price off?

791
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,640
It's me, the deals warlock.

792
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
I have appeared.

793
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,280
I have heard your wish and I have appeared from the ether.

794
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Don't make the deal with him.

795
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,760
It always turns bad.

796
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,280
I shall sell you cheaper blades.

797
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
What are you looking for?

798
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,480
Justin, don't do it.

799
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
Would you like a scimitar?

800
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,200
An epi?

801
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,160
What's this here about?

802
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,480
What kind of blade are you in the market for, dear sirs?

803
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,840
From me, Garfield, the deals warlock.

804
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,320
Well, deals warlock, what I-

805
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,160
Call me Garfield, shimity-bippity-sippity-shee.

806
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
I have cast a spell on all of your belongings

807
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,920
and now they all cost less.

808
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
If you try to trade it, don't try and sell your car now

809
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,400
for I have reduced its price in the blue books.

810
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,880
So Garfield, I would like to pay $10 for this starter kit.

811
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,800
Call me the deals warlock.

812
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
No, hold on just a darn minute.

813
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
Did I say something to offend you?

814
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,960
No, you just change it every time.

815
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
I am inscrutable.

816
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,920
I'll try to keep up.

817
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,280
So how can I save $5 off this starter set?

818
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,880
I shall prepare the incantation kit.

819
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,000
Or you could just go to harrys.com

820
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,200
and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word,

821
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,280
and you could get that starter kit for $10.

822
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,080
I just controlled Travis's brain to make him say that.

823
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,080
I have conjured the spell into his brain and his mouth.

824
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,760
I was inside of his mouth and it was very clean.

825
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,440
I was gonna say it anyways.

826
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm inside your mouth.

827
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
My Brother, My Brother, Me is also supported

828
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,920
in part by Squarespace, the all-in-one website platform

829
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,480
that makes it easy and fast

830
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,280
to create your own professional website.

831
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,040
Squarespace has beautiful templates.

832
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,440
They've got integration with Google apps and Getty Images

833
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
and a feature called Cover Pages.

834
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I've actually been thinking about making a website

835
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,880
with Squarespace myself

836
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,040
for YouTube serious things about it sheets.

837
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm holding off until they have integration with Getty Lee.

838
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,520
You can get a free trial with no credit card required.

839
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,400
You could use the coupon code MYBROTHER, all one word,

840
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,880
for 10% off your first purchase.

841
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,720
And now I away.

842
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,240
Farewell.

843
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,520
Save the cat life.

844
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,880
No, you stay here.

845
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,560
You read the next one, wizard.

846
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,400
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

847
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,440
I must, but I must away.

848
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,480
No, Warlock, what is our next, what's our next ad?

849
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,280
There's a red Tad saying let's Michael's.

850
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,440
Hey guys, it's Griffin, I'm back.

851
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,080
Oh, thank God.

852
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,000
This message is for Illustration.

853
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,840
I think it's Illustrate Ian.

854
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
Illustrate Ian.

855
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,800
Well, it's spelled like illustration,

856
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,120
but with an A at the end instead of an O.

857
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,720
Because the guy who does it is named Ian.

858
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,200
Well, agree to disagree.

859
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Okay, Illustrate Ian is doing portrait commissions,

860
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
which make great gifts.

861
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
He specializes in D&D character portraits.

862
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,600
He won our adventure zone art contest

863
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,360
and he made my Twitter avatar,

864
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,840
which actually, no, that's no longer true

865
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,080
because now my Twitter avatar is Chaz the dog,

866
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,400
but he made my former Twitter avatar,

867
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,880
which was me floating surrounded by dice

868
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,080
and I have like bony rock protrusions coming out of my body.

869
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,360
It was totally radical.

870
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,160
It was really great.

871
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,400
He's available for freelance illustration work.

872
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,800
If you want it drawed, he will draw it.

873
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,680
Again, that's Illustrate Ian, I-A-N.

874
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,880
If you go to illustration.com slash commish

875
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
and subscribe to Illustrate Ian on Instagram,

876
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
you can enter for a chance to win

877
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
a monthly full body portrait giveaway.

878
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,840
Go check it out.

879
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,600
It really is good artworks.

880
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,920
And I liked it for a very, very long time,

881
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
and now I'm a dog and I didn't want to confuse people.

882
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
Our next message is for Gracie Girl.

883
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,440
And it's from your man.

884
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,760
And your man says,

885
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,040
for our anniversary,

886
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,720
I got the brothers to shout your name

887
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,840
from the microphone tops

888
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,480
and acknowledge you as the long lost sister.

889
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm using the brothers

890
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
for what they were originally intended for

891
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,520
and best suited to as a mouthpiece for love.

892
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,880
I've enjoyed nothing more than the last five years together.

893
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Here is to infinity more.

894
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720
P.S. Moe is the best dog.

895
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,800
Is the dog gonna-

896
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
I feel like that was like the last sentence.

897
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,480
That was all very sweet.

898
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,880
And the last sentence was like a hidden secret,

899
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,160
like barb in an ongoing argument about best dogs.

900
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
Also fuck your dog.

901
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
My dog's the best.

902
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
Nana Nana Boo Boo.

903
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
P.S. Moe rules and Bethany drools.

904
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,560
Bethany is a great name for a dog, Justin.

905
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
You should be a professional dog namer.

906
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,000
Thank you.

907
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,200
You should work at a pound

908
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
and just walk down the line going like,

909
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,680
that's a Bethany.

910
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,520
That's a Michelle.

911
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,120
Name any dog and I will rename it for you.

912
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,680
Buttercup.

913
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,280
Cup butter.

914
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
That was way better.

915
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,480
Next.

916
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Comet from Full House.

917
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,400
Air Bud.

918
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay.

919
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,560
Was that the same dog?

920
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,360
Air Bud.

921
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,320
Spiritually at least.

922
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,040
Air Bud the dog.

923
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,440
No it was.

924
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,080
It was the same dog.

925
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,160
Air Bud the dog's from Air Bud.

926
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,720
They replaced Air Bud for Golden Receiver

927
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,040
because the original Air Bud slash Comet got paw cancer.

928
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,640
Oh Justin.

929
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,920
Welcome to our comedy show.

930
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,280
Those are the two saddest words I've ever heard put together

931
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,160
before in my life.

932
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,600
I could meditate for years on a mountaintop in a cave

933
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,960
trying to think of two sad words

934
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,080
and I would come out

935
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,240
and I would be like child disease

936
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
and you'd be like no paw cancer.

937
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,240
What's up?

938
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,040
Sadder than that.

939
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,400
That wasn't a joke.

940
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
It's actually what happened.

941
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
I know it's not a joke.

942
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,560
Jokes make you laugh typically.

943
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,280
This is Biz.

944
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,160
And I'm Teresa.

945
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
And we host a show called One Bad Mother,

946
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
a comedy podcast about parenting.

947
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Not a parenting podcast.

948
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,440
Guess what?

949
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,040
We both just had babies.

950
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Again.

951
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike

952
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

953
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
I recently started a new job

954
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,320
and I have been trained by an older and more experienced co-worker.

955
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,680
She recently spent a great deal,

956
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
wait a lady boss?

957
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
That wasn't gonna fit anywhere on my button.

958
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760
Gonna redesign my whole button now.

959
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,400
Thanks a lot.

960
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
She recently spent a great deal of time

961
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,880
showing me how to complete our billing process

962
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,600
the old fashioned way with pen and paper.

963
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,160
That's right.

964
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,960
Afterwards, I quickly created an Excel spreadsheet

965
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
that completed all the work almost instantly.

966
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,760
I feel like I should show her how

967
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
she could be doing her work more efficiently

968
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,360
but I'm worried I might hurt her feelings

969
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,160
or make her feel stupid as she's not very tech savvy.

970
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,080
Should I let her keep doing things her way

971
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,920
or bring her into the 21st century?

972
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,120
Important context.

973
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,840
We are funded by your tax dollars.

974
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,760
That's from cautious kid in Chicago.

975
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Shit.

976
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,400
Oh, this is tough.

977
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,440
Think of it this way though.

978
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,560
If you get her on this system and this is her whole job,

979
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,320
it sounds like if she's spending this much time spreading sheets

980
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,760
and you can teach her to knock that shit out

981
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
in like 15 minutes with Excel

982
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
and that saves her from a whole day's work.

983
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,160
She can spend the rest of that day

984
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
just like blazing it and playing Halo.

985
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,320
But Griffin, counterpoint,

986
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
what if you start to show it to her

987
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,400
and she just like can't like,

988
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,360
she's like, no, I don't like Excel.

989
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
I don't want to do this.

990
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,160
And now she knows that there's a better way

991
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,320
that she cannot like do

992
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,760
and she's stuck in a pen and paper prison.

993
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
Then she'll be swallowed up

994
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
and devoured by the free market

995
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,960
and digested and turned into the fuel

996
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
that burns to power our economy, Travis.

997
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,440
In case you have never worked anywhere,

998
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,960
let me tell you how this short story ends.

999
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,120
You show her how to make the quicker spreadsheets.

1000
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,200
She starts making the quicker spreadsheets.

1001
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Her bosses realize that she's not doing anything all day.

1002
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,200
She gets fired.

1003
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
You end up doing all the spreadsheets.

1004
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,280
Guaranteed, this is how it shakes out.

1005
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Just let her keep doing her thing,

1006
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,080
wasting your tax dollars.

1007
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,560
Think of it, for every week or so of work

1008
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,840
that we pay this woman for

1009
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,000
that she could be doing with computers,

1010
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,920
that's another drone the government can't buy.

1011
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,240
So you're like helping.

1012
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,520
You're helping in a way, in a weird sort of way.

1013
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,560
Maybe.

1014
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
There is also something to be said.

1015
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
Or maybe you're taking fuel out of the rocket to Mars.

1016
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
I have no idea.

1017
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,680
There's also something to be said though

1018
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,840
for the fact that this person was doing their job

1019
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
before you got there.

1020
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,520
And like, unless every day the boss was walking up to her

1021
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
and saying like, still taking forever, huh Deborah?

1022
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,560
Okay.

1023
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,160
Like she's was doing this before you got there

1024
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,920
and seemingly was doing fine.

1025
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
So it's super cool that you have a way

1026
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
that moves much faster.

1027
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,240
And if the opportunity presents itself,

1028
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,200
if she's ever like,

1029
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,280
how do you seem to be getting it done so much quicker?

1030
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,120
Be like, oh, I use this Excel spreadsheet.

1031
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Do you want me to show you how to do it?

1032
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,760
Great, awesome.

1033
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,840
Now you've totally gotten in and you could do that.

1034
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
But until that happens,

1035
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,680
she seems like she was perfectly happy doing it her way.

1036
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
You know how in that one episode of Doug,

1037
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
Doug's dad makes him a boring kite

1038
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
and all the other kids have cool kites?

1039
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,040
Yeah.

1040
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
And Doug thinks the kite sucks.

1041
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,280
So he tries to add like wings and flare to it.

1042
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,600
Classic.

1043
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
And his dad's like,

1044
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
do you remember what his dad says it actually was Trav?

1045
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,120
It was a racing kite.

1046
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,240
It was a fighter kite.

1047
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,280
Fighter kite, that's right.

1048
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,320
A fighter kite.

1049
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Maybe this is that sort of scenario.

1050
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
She knows about your computer method.

1051
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
She's got a fighter spreadsheet.

1052
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
And with your method, she's like,

1053
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
oh yeah, I've heard about that.

1054
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,760
Go check the files you already done.

1055
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
I can't find them.

1056
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,040
That's right.

1057
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
Our computers delete everything every day.

1058
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:00,880
Right.

1059
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
That's why you've been wasting your time.

1060
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,600
Oh, our computers turned against us in 2008.

1061
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,640
When Y2KXV happens and it's happening.

1062
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,080
Oh, read the literature.

1063
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Oh my God, get online, read the literature.

1064
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,880
Lose change three.

1065
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
Lose change three.

1066
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
Kim Trails and Y2KXV.

1067
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
It's gonna happen.

1068
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,120
And then when that happens, what happened to your spreadsheets?

1069
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,120
They got gobbled up by the internet's Satan demons.

1070
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,400
But what happened to hers?

1071
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,720
Nothing.

1072
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,680
They're fine.

1073
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,560
You'll be visiting her on a throne of spreadsheets.

1074
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,400
She'll be trading spreadsheets for sexual favors with her war boys.

1075
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,360
Beautiful concubines.

1076
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
These aren't spreadsheets.

1077
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,440
These are fuck coupons.

1078
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,560
If I give you two pages of the Anderson file, we're doing it in the butt.

1079
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,040
That's the deal.

1080
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
That's the deal, Sandwalker.

1081
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,480
Take it or leave it.

1082
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1083
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,400
Sure.

1084
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
This Yahoo was also sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1085
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,720
Thank you.

1086
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,080
Climbing that ladder, Zoe Kinski.

1087
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Smart Stuff, who asks,

1088
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,080
My husband is jealous of Guy Fieri.

1089
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,760
I absolutely love watching the Triple D.

1090
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,760
My husband thinks it's because I have a crush on Guy Fieri,

1091
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,200
which I do, but that's not why I watch it.

1092
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,560
Good eye, husband.

1093
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
I mean, he nailed it in one.

1094
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,920
He has diagnosed my Fieri desires.

1095
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
My question-

1096
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,840
Wait, my deep dark desire, my Triple D.

1097
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,640
My question, why is it that men get jealous of people on TV?

1098
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
I don't get jealous if he thinks someone is hot on a show.

1099
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,440
Do I stop watching out of respect to him?

1100
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
He's never been insecure in our marriage.

1101
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,880
And I really don't want him to think I'm being insensitive to his feelings.

1102
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,320
Also, this is posted in entertainment and music horror scopes.

1103
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,280
There it is.

1104
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
I think that the real problem here is not that your husband is jealous of someone on TV.

1105
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,760
He's deeply confused and disturbed by your choice of sexual fantasy.

1106
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
If you have a crush on, say, a George Clooney-esque person who-

1107
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
I can't be that.

1108
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
No, you see George Clooney and you think, I could be that someday.

1109
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
If my wife formed a crush on an Elijah Wood, I would be like, okay, I could probably swing that.

1110
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
You're Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

1111
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,080
You're Joseph-

1112
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,680
Well, no, now we're reaching for the stars.

1113
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,440
But on Elijah Wood, I could scratch that itch maybe someday if I drop a few LBs.

1114
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,080
I could do that.

1115
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,960
I could do that.

1116
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,080
I could do that.

1117
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,000
Guy Fieri, I can't become that.

1118
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
And I've become a dog.

1119
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,600
That's not doable.

1120
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't know what sort of chemical peel action I will need.

1121
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,280
I saw somebody on Instagram post a picture of them sitting next to Guy Fieri on a plane,

1122
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,840
and that dude was passed out, sleeping forward, which, how does a body do that?

1123
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,000
I will never possess a body that can do that.

1124
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
Not only that, he had a trucker cap, and he had taken his trucker cap,

1125
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,920
and he had wedged it up into the cover for the plane's window

1126
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,080
so that his hat was in the window like he's giving his hat special treatment.

1127
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,960
Look at the sky.

1128
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,400
Look at the sky, you beautiful trucker hat.

1129
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,320
And what sort of mind thinks to do that?

1130
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,360
I'm on a plane, so I'm going to jam my hat into a window.

1131
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,640
I can never become Guy Fieri.

1132
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,600
I think it's the same sort of mind that thinks about making cheesecake with mozzarella bites

1133
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,320
or whatever the fuck that is.

1134
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
Right, that's what I'm saying.

1135
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,560
Let's make a margarita with the nachos already in it.

1136
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,240
Saves you time.

1137
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:50,480
If I take Guy Fieri's blood and I inject it into myself, I'll be burned from the inside out.

1138
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,840
To your question as to whether or not you should stop watching Guy Fieri, I mean, you can try.

1139
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,160
Yeah.

1140
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,240
As I've chronicled on my day-by-day life blog, Fieri Walk With Me, about my Guy Fieri addiction,

1141
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,640
I have tried many times to give him up, but it is impossible.

1142
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,760
Also, if you leave any show on the Food Network, once it concludes, Guy Fieri will appear.

1143
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah.

1144
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,280
Guy Fieri is the one who shakes you out of your food hypnosis.

1145
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
Oh, were you having a good time?

1146
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,440
Not anymore.

1147
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,640
People give Fieri a hard time, but he's a really good reminder that you should probably get out

1148
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,600
of the house today.

1149
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,680
Like, hey, it's 2 p.m. and you're still wearing pajamas.

1150
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,080
Maybe it's time to do something with this Saturday.

1151
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,560
Look at me, I'm incredibly successful for no other reason than I put on real clothes

1152
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,840
and left the house.

1153
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,760
This is the end of the Spring Baking Challenge marathon has arrived, and now maybe you should

1154
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,400
go out and do something in the garden.

1155
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
Have you called your loved ones?

1156
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,200
Hey, this is Guy Fieri and I just jumped into the barefoot contest's body like Agent Smith.

1157
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,680
Are you okay?

1158
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,920
I miss Alton Brown.

1159
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,600
It's too bad that his body got jumped into by Guy Fieri like Agent Smith,

1160
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,240
and he took over the show and he called it Bad Eats.

1161
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,360
And he called it like a version of Bad to the Bone when it came on.

1162
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,440
He changed the show's name to Not Eats, No Longer Eats.

1163
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,280
That's more of a warning than anything else.

1164
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,040
I'm a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty job at a shooty restaurant.

1165
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,840
Wow, Jesus, Justin, you got like six of those words wrong, buddy.

1166
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
There are like 12 words in there and you gotta have one wrong.

1167
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:39,680
Okay, I'm a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty day job at a sushi resta-

1168
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,000
You still didn't do great, yeah, yeah.

1169
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,560
It's a day job at a sushi restaurant.

1170
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,120
That's hard.

1171
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,720
Okay, you guys right now read that line.

1172
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,440
Travis, cold, go.

1173
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,200
A pretty shitty day job at a sushi restaurant.

1174
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,720
No, the whole sentence, the whole sentence.

1175
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,720
I am a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty day job at a sushi restaurant.

1176
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,920
Fine, okay.

1177
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,640
It's both boring and hectic and it makes me incredibly anxious.

1178
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,040
I just got offered a job at a candy shop.

1179
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,640
It pays more, has better hours, and will be far less stressful.

1180
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,600
So here's my question.

1181
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,240
Why is there a question?

1182
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,040
Since the working hours for both jobs don't overlap,

1183
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,480
should I do both at once for a while and test the waters at the candy store?

1184
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,600
I don't want to leave this restaurant and find out the candy store is even rougher.

1185
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,040
And that's from I got 99 problems and two of them are jobs.

1186
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,040
Okay, this is my immediate takeaway from this.

1187
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,720
Your biggest concern about working at a candy store is going to have to be dealing with like

1188
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,080
shitty kids, right?

1189
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,200
Kids running around and like spoiled breath and that kind of thing, right?

1190
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,880
Now let me pose this.

1191
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,160
What sounds worse, that or the shitty people you would face working at a sushi restaurant

1192
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,840
who like ask way too many questions and are really spoiled adults?

1193
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,720
I'd rather deal with shitty kids.

1194
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,800
Is that what you think people who eat sushi are like?

1195
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,160
No, no, no.

1196
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,200
But I'm saying that like if you're talking about the negative, bad part of it.

1197
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,320
The bad seeds.

1198
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,600
Yeah, I'm saying if you're just talking about the shitty part of the job,

1199
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,920
it's the shitty people at the sushi store versus the shitty people at the candy store.

1200
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,840
I'd rather deal with the shitty people at the candy store because then you're still

1201
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,040
surrounded by candy.

1202
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,680
The last time I was at Candy Craze at the Huntington Mall, I was trying to find a certain

1203
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,840
kind of candy and it was, I didn't know the name of it, but I had like the texture and

1204
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,040
the flavor in my mind and I found something that I thought was it.

1205
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,320
A taste I remember from my childhood, right?

1206
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,200
I thought it was it.

1207
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,160
What I found out I was looking for was seafoam candy, but that's neither here nor there.

1208
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,880
This is not it.

1209
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,640
But I took a piece out before making, had this been the right candy, a considerable

1210
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,440
bulk purchase.

1211
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,240
And as I did it, the woman who was running the shop from the back, who I was sure I was

1212
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:50,480
out of eyesight, the woman running the shop from the back noscoped me and said, you gotta

1213
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,600
you gotta pay for the candy before you eat it.

1214
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, Justin, how did you feel in that moment?

1215
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,800
Take me inside.

1216
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,080
How did I feel for it?

1217
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,360
Let me take you inside.

1218
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,560
I have not been back.

1219
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,720
It's been eight months and I have to walk past a store called Candy Craze when I'm

1220
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,640
at my favorite place, the Huntington Mall.

1221
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,040
I have to walk past Candy Craze sheepishly.

1222
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,880
But in my head, I'm thinking I would have bought a lot of candy that day.

1223
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,520
You don't even know.

1224
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,440
You need to go in there and be like, listen, madam, if you would let me steal just a little

1225
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,920
bit of candy, if you had let me steal that initial piece of candy, I would have.

1226
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,200
Oh, the investment would have been so much bigger.

1227
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Every other thing you on Earth, you could try before you buy.

1228
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,400
Check the margins on this.

1229
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,560
OK, I wanted a candy trailer.

1230
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,760
That's all I was looking for.

1231
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,000
OK, I wanted one sampler.

1232
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,160
Right.

1233
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,360
But you don't go to I was you don't go to Best Buy and be like, oh, I do want to buy

1234
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,040
that 52 inch plasma screen.

1235
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,840
But first, I'm going to steal these headphones.

1236
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,480
Is that OK?

1237
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,760
You know, but you go to the best.

1238
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,360
Nobody can look at the TV on the wall and you steal the remote control.

1239
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,640
And you take that home and now you've got to eat it.

1240
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,040
I would have spent I mean, I would have spent Plasma TV money on Seafoam candy.

1241
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,640
Give me three thousand dollars of Seafoam candy.

1242
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,880
I want to bathe in it like Scrooge McDuck.

1243
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,920
P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1244
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,960
And if anybody can see if you can find pickle gum, send us that too, because I've been looking

1245
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,480
for it since I was like 12.

1246
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,640
If now I'll give you a warning, if it's melted Seafoam, I will hunt you down and kill you.

1247
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,120
Here it is.

1248
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,880
So here's the last thing I'll say about this question.

1249
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,160
The situation I feel bad for you in that situation, Justin, because you must have felt so,

1250
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,600
so very small.

1251
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,200
Oh, you must have felt like a borrower.

1252
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,640
I did feel small.

1253
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,120
Come on.

1254
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,840
I'm I'm a white, straight male in America.

1255
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,360
I've never heard no before.

1256
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,000
Right.

1257
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,800
Exactly.

1258
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,960
But think about how many white, straight males that woman had to say.

1259
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,120
You got to buy the candy before you can eat it, sir.

1260
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,560
That day.

1261
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh, you think she goes home to her husband and she's like, I had to do it again.

1262
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,720
I had to.

1263
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,520
That was my point.

1264
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,120
I was getting around to it.

1265
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,360
Shit.

1266
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,760
Thank you.

1267
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,440
That could be you.

1268
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,320
I mean, that's the thing you got to remember is you're going to have to be the one who's

1269
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,200
like basically causing people, I can testify, the worst day of their lives.

1270
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,920
Right.

1271
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,640
A hundred percent.

1272
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,200
And you're going to be the one doing it.

1273
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,400
Probably every couple of minutes, I would imagine.

1274
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,360
But you got to be careful if you're going to do both jobs, though, because if you show

1275
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,400
up to the sushi job and you're in your candy job uniform, they're going to know that you

1276
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:26,480
are cheating on them or or or you say, well, here's my idea, you guys.

1277
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,200
Candy sushi.

1278
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,080
Oh, my God.

1279
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,640
What's the right?

1280
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,800
Like, obviously the top can be like sour tape.

1281
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,000
But what's what's the rice?

1282
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,880
I'm thinking the rice is maybe like a rice crispy treat.

1283
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,440
Like I was going to say rice crispy or like a jelly belly, like buttered popcorn.

1284
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,160
That's little though.

1285
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,920
That's that's all kind of mush.

1286
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,800
But you get a bunch of them.

1287
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,080
You mush them together.

1288
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,800
My my wife will sometimes have chocolate and fruit candies in the same bag.

1289
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,000
What?

1290
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,720
What?

1291
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,000
Well, she's a monster.

1292
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,720
Can you imagine?

1293
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,120
Can you even imagine?

1294
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,800
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

1295
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,680
My brother, my brother, me.

1296
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
It's an advice show for the modern era.

1297
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,280
Hey, if you're not listening to it already, we do another podcast with our daddy called

1298
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,080
the Adventure Zone.

1299
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,440
It's a D&D podcast.

1300
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,000
And you can go and you can find it on Maximumfun.org.

1301
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
You can find it on iTunes.

1302
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,320
We just released our, I guess, our 15th episode.

1303
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,040
16th.

1304
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,400
Yeah, we're from 16th.

1305
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
It's a story based show.

1306
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,200
So you want to start back at the beginning, I think.

1307
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,120
But Travis has made that even easier for you.

1308
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,160
Travis, can you explain how?

1309
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,240
So our first episode, it's great if you love D&D, if you've played before.

1310
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,400
And we talk a lot about how fifth edition is different from previous editions and how

1311
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,520
gameplay works.

1312
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,120
But we heard from a couple of people that, like, they just wanted to get into the story

1313
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,960
and they weren't really interested in gameplay.

1314
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,880
So we re-edited the first episode and edited it from two hours down to 52 minutes.

1315
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,160
So it's just the storyline, the funny parts and the character development.

1316
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,560
So if you've got a friend that you know would love the show, but maybe you think would

1317
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,600
be turned off by all the gameplay stuff, then play episode 1.5 for them.

1318
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,880
Or maybe it's you and you're like, oh, man, I really want to get into it.

1319
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,000
But, like, they started talking about, like, how saving throws work and I just don't care.

1320
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,560
Great.

1321
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,080
Listen to episode 1.5.

1322
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,600
That's going to be your end.

1323
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,680
There are other podcasts, too, on Maximum Fun that we do and don't do.

1324
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,120
Justin does a show with his wife, Sydney, called Saw Bones, and it's a medical history

1325
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,760
show.

1326
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,560
And Travis does a show with his buddy, Andy, called Bunker Buddies.

1327
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,640
And Travis has another show that's not on Maximum Fun that he just launched with his

1328
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,240
buddy, Brent, called Trends Like These.

1329
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,400
And then there's other shows on Maximum Fun that we're not a part of, like Judge John

1330
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Hodgman, and Stop Podcasting Yourself, and Lady 2 Lady, and One Bad Mother, Throwing Shade,

1331
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,960
and The Flophouse.

1332
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,920
They're all really, really great.

1333
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,160
So go to MaximumFun.org and you can find all those shows.

1334
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,640
They're terrific.

1335
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,680
Go listen to them.

1336
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,160
Awesome.

1337
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,440
We've got a Pacific Northwest tour coming up at the end of August.

1338
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,560
Tickets are still on sale for Seattle and Vancouver.

1339
00:53:52,560 --> 00:54:01,360
If you go to bit.ly forward slash mbmbamseattle and bit.ly forward slash vanmbmbam, you can

1340
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,320
find those tickets there.

1341
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,880
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1342
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,720
a Departure, off the album, But In the Days to Bed.

1343
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,800
Do you guys realize that like this time next week, we'll be saying that in front of John

1344
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,360
Roderick?

1345
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,240
Yeah, or like sitting on his lap, giving him gentle kisses on his cheek.

1346
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,800
Well, probably not that one.

1347
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,680
Thank you, John Roderick.

1348
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,480
Thank you, Daddy.

1349
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,360
Thank you, Daddy Roderick.

1350
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:30,160
I also want to plug Justin's hit web series, Things I Bought at Sheets, which you can find

1351
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:37,440
at sheetsshow.com, it's Sheets, S-H-E-E-T-Z show.com, that he does with his buddy Dwight.

1352
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
It's like the best video series.

1353
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,960
It comes out just about every day, and I cannot wait for every episode.

1354
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,440
It's a roller coaster.

1355
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,240
Every episode is a treat.

1356
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,920
I really like it, Travis, I've been meaning to ask you if you really like it.

1357
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,120
I do, I really love it.

1358
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,720
Teresa and I watch it every morning.

1359
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,360
Justin and I also play video games for Polygon in a series that we launched recently called

1360
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,680
Monster Factory, that I'm very, very proud of.

1361
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,360
I watched all the Monster Factory videos.

1362
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,240
They're good, they're like 30.

1363
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,040
What did you think of them?

1364
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,360
I enjoyed them deeply.

1365
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,720
Squirtle was one of my favorites, but the Fallout one-

1366
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,840
The Fallout one turned out pretty good.

1367
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,960
You guys outdid yourselves.

1368
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,840
Man, we got our fingers in a lot of pies, huh, boys?

1369
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,400
We do have-

1370
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,040
A lot of pies.

1371
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,000
Oh, we're sorry about that.

1372
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,360
I feel guilty about my Twitter feed right now, because it's just like, I made something

1373
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,520
else, look at it, Dad.

1374
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,200
Well, you should also check out-

1375
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,200
John Roderick, look at my goof-em-ups.

1376
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,240
Are you proud of me now?

1377
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,920
John Roderick, you proud of me?

1378
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,200
I made a Fallout goof-em-up, Daddy Roderick.

1379
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,240
Daddy's actually over here watching the puddle for me, and I literally said to him out loud,

1380
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,680
hey, Daddy, you want to watch my Things About It Sheets videos I made this week?

1381
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,720
Oh, man.

1382
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,560
You want to pat my head while you tell me how good that is?

1383
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,280
Did I do a good job?

1384
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,960
I know I just tweeted this out to tens of thousands of people, but I need your approval,

1385
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,680
desperately.

1386
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,560
Please, Daddy.

1387
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,400
Do you guys want a Final Yahoo?

1388
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,440
Yes, please.

1389
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,680
Final Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

1390
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,320
Thank you, Rachel.

1391
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:06,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kamal, who asks, what medicine is for longtime sex?

1392
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,240
I'm Justin McElroy.

1393
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1394
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,320
