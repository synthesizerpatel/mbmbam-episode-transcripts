1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me picks the Oscars.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm going to start with the grouch. Oh, no, don't. Don't make that joke. Oh, fuck.

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,080
You're going to start with what?

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
The grouch.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
He said the grouch. What's your favorite Oscar, Travis?

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Mine is Oscar from The Odd Couple, and you should say, like, your name.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Nope. I don't want to be associated with this goof.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I like that spring-legged murderer.

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Sorry, which one?

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
Pardon?

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,360
The one that the blade-footed wife killer.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,800
Blade-footed wife killer Oscar.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
Oscar Pistorius.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,400
Pistorius.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
Oh, no!

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,680
Blade-footed wife killer Oscar Pistorius is your favorite Oscar?

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,320
See, I thought you were talking about Spring-heeled Jack,

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,520
and it turned into a much worse thing.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,560
I know that's why I was confused. I was very lost as to the direction Griffin was taking it.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,800
This summer, in The Fugitive 2, Oscar Pistorius is on the run from the law

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,960
as he races against time to find the two-legged man that killed his wife.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
I literally made that joke last week and on last week's Besties.

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,720
I did it. It's never made it to press.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
That is a three-peat.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,160
It's never made it to press. It's never made it to press.

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
It's always been before.

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
That is a three-peat.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,680
Griffin, you edit both those shows. Has that ever made it to press?

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,280
It's made it to my ears three times.

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Then just leave it in the show for once.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Tragedy plus time equals comedy, and comedy plus time equals whatever that was.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
It circles back around and turns back to tragedy again.

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
This is my brother. My brother reads an advice show for the modern era.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
The Oscars are over. Congratulations to Argo.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
You really think Argo's going to take it?

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
I just haven't seen that many of them.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,920
Can I be honest with you guys? I don't even know who's nominated for Best Picture.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,880
God, you uncultured gilbers.

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,280
The only movies I saw this year are Argo and the training DVD for my blender.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Unless Lady Mixing Up Strawberries is nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,560
It's picking up a lot of buzz with the foreign press, though.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
I mean, but they'll fucking watch anything.

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,000
Have you guys seen Amour?

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,360
It's like, oh, we get it. They're old and they're dying slow.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
It's like cocoon if the aliens didn't come down.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
It's just non-plot driven cocoon.

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
It's like, you know how Waking Ned Divide is about old Irish people?

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
It's like if you took cocoon and took out all the action sequences.

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,360
Right.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,440
Take out Ned Beatty and Warren Beatty and Diabetes.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
What's his name?

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,920
Diabetes Beatty.

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,560
Diabetes Beatty.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
No, what's that, what's that, what's that?

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Woodrow Wilson.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
You're thinking of Ed Grimley.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Oh my God, just give me a straight answer.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,640
Alfred Grimley, you son of a bitch.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,960
Okay, you guys talk one at a time, all right?

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,520
Travis, what is Wilford Brimley's name?

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,960
William Howard Taft.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,240
Okay, bad.

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
Griffin, what is Wilford Brimley's name?

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Um, I fucking know this.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
What is cocoon?

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,360
Fuck!

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Correct, that is correct.

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,640
You did get it right with under the wire to go.

73
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,080
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,840
It's an advice show for the modern era.

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
That's right, we're ready to help you.

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,440
We've got our own stuff together and now we're gonna help you do the same thing.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
Is Wilford Brimley nominated for an Oscar this year?

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
He's nominated for best dead person forever.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
He's not dead.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
He's dead as fuck.

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,200
God, is he not dead?

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,120
Wilford Brimley?

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Is he not dead?

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,360
No.

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Wilford Brimley's alive as fuck.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,480
I know.

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,960
That oatmeal is getting it done for you.

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,000
It's true.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
He loves it.

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
He stirs in a spoonful of insulin every day, keeps him going.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
Do you guys hear his voice when you eat oatmeal?

92
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
Like, I think of that like,

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,760
it's good, it's got good for your stuff in it to keep you going all day long.

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,440
Like, oh, that's really good.

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,080
I eat it.

96
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,040
I hear really erotic things in Wilford Brimley's voice.

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
Shove that right in.

98
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
You know what else is rich and creamy and has flakes of oats in it?

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,160
Oatmeal.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
Also might come.

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm a hundred.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,360
Okay, good, good show today.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Over the last 15 months, I've lost around 100 pounds,

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,040
built muscle and gotten more fit all around

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
using just exercise and willpower.

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,080
I now find myself with a tiny bit of something I never had,

107
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
self-confidence.

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
Are there any steps I can take to nurture and grow this confidence

109
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
in the continuing attempt to be a better me?

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Thanks in advance, progressing in Pittsburgh.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
First of all, congratulations.

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
That's fantastic.

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,720
Way to go.

114
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm proud of you.

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Unless you weighed like 120 pounds beforehand and then like-

116
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm down to just a skull at this point, basically.

117
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,120
This is beyond like a level of Kate Moss unhealthiness.

118
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
This is like thinner.

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
This is fucking bad news.

120
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
You look fantastic.

121
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
We're really worried about you.

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
You weigh less than eight pairs of shoes.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
I'm really worried.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,280
Justin, why do you continue to insist on comparing things to shoe weight?

126
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
Because when I was in school, they told us that one pair of shoes weighs a kilogram.

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,640
And so I somehow got it in my head that that's a pretty good system for measurement.

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,920
That seems flawed because every shoe is different.

129
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,600
Is that like one pair of adult male cowboy boots or like one stiletto heel?

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Every shoe is different, Travis.

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,760
I think we would all do well to remember that.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,680
But they all have beautiful soles.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Travis, you're such a carry.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,760
You guys.

135
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,880
I would, man, it sounds like you got enough.

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,160
You just wrote into a podcast to brag about how fucking super healthy you are.

137
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
And that's great and everything.

138
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
I wouldn't get any more confident than that.

139
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,160
I think I think you go any further than that.

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
You're bordering on Hitler.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Well, I'm not sure Hitler though.

143
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm saying that he gains a little bit more confidence.

144
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Pretty soon he's going to sleep through the world.

145
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,320
No, I don't think so.

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
No, I guess maybe.

147
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
To be fair, I may not know the origins of Hitler.

148
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Hitler lost like a hundred pounds.

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
What his whole scene is.

150
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Sort of what his place in history was.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Like who the guy who the guy is.

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Any of it at all.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
It was that he did some paintings and got really confident.

154
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,280
And turned that confidence into like a dictatorship.

155
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah, that's true.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,820
Right?

157
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,260
I mean, I am proud of you.

158
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,020
It's just you don't want to...

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,340
Do you want to be the next Jared?

160
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,620
Like I hate to bring up Jared every fucking week on this show.

161
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,020
But it does seem that way lately, doesn't it?

162
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,060
It does kind of seem.

163
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,500
Jared is the new ghosts.

164
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,700
And like I worry because every time that dude comes on your TV.

165
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,820
Like here it comes again.

166
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm getting another fucking earful from Jared about how eating nothing but Subway sandwiches

167
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,580
turned his fucking life around.

168
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,940
But he says it now in a way.

169
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,060
He's like, I ate sandwiches until I half disappeared.

170
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,580
And it's like, we get it, dude.

171
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,300
And it's doubly irritating because you know now he has like the money to like pay someone for that.

172
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,540
Right.

173
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,100
You know what I mean?

174
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,060
Like he has the money to hire a personal chef.

175
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,540
Yeah, I don't think he's rolling into Subway and buying those sandwiches anymore.

176
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,500
More importantly, he's got enough money that he can just put the weight back on again.

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,100
Because like he has so much money.

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,380
Even if he goes on like an eating spree, becomes the Burger King spokesperson for a year

179
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,140
and then blimpos back up.

180
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,940
He's still going to be extremely, extremely fuckable because all that skrill.

181
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,380
We're losing the narrative of Jared.

182
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,140
The narrative has lost its impact.

183
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:14,340
I think he needs to put on like two Hyundai and be a spokesperson for Butterburger for a while.

184
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,180
He needs a spiral is what you're saying.

185
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,780
Yeah, he needs an arc.

186
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,740
Specifically, he needs two arcs on either side of his body that represent his coming back.

187
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,820
As goes Jared, so goes the country.

188
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,260
I think if Jared becomes the BK spokesman, comes out, does a press conference says,

189
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm done with this healthy living.

190
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,660
You only get one trip around this beautiful blue orb and I'm going to spend mine eating

191
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,140
a sloppy dog or whatever they have at Burger King.

192
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,580
I mean, they get some chicken.

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,700
Mainly sloppy dogs.

194
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm going to get myself a sloppy dog chicken slipper combo, which is like an actual footwear

195
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,260
made of fried chicken.

196
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,940
He just really, really loses himself.

197
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:06,740
Then a year later, he's back up to 450, flips back to Subway for Prodigal Son, comes back,

198
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,540
and says, I'm doing it again, America, getting healthy for you.

199
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,740
We didn't see him lose the weight the first time.

200
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,180
We were just like, all we got was a skinny, nerd-ass looking dude with some big old pants.

201
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm not sure that that's good evidence for me.

202
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,980
Did he start the big pants movement?

203
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,540
I know, but it's one of my favorite things in weight loss commercials where it's like,

204
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,740
I've got big pants.

205
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh, good for you.

206
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,100
Because maybe what you don't see is he's got giant legs when he was fat, but his torso

207
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,220
is completely normal.

208
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,780
I saw Norbert, you know?

209
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,420
Yeah, sure.

210
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,180
This is not Jermaine, you just wanted to brag that you-

211
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,340
You were one of the three people in the country that saw Norbert.

212
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,060
I did see Norbert.

213
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm not ashamed.

214
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,420
If you were to ask if I've seen Norbert or not, the answer is yes.

215
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,060
I saw it.

216
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
I don't know how to tell somebody to have comp-

217
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,820
When somebody walks up and says, how would you evaluate yourself?

218
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,580
Just go pretty good, I guess.

219
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,460
That's it.

220
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,420
And then you have confidence.

221
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,020
Moving on up, getting better.

222
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,940
I don't know, it's just one of those things where it's like, you could, I don't know,

223
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,620
is it a fake it till you make it thing or just keep taking care of yourself?

224
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,420
But the more you care for yourself, the more you like yourself and the more confidence

225
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,920
you'll have.

226
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,740
That's what I have to assume.

227
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,500
I don't think you just wake up one day and be like, I'm confident now.

228
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:43,780
I have noticed that, maybe not, this may not be necessarily confidence, but in terms of

229
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:52,260
just keeping yourself going, I think that I've had some success with doing a little

230
00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:00,260
bit of exercise in the mornings, kind of sending yourself the signal that it's worth taking

231
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,980
care of yourself.

232
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,180
And I think that if you do a little bit of that kind of stuff every day, you do stuff

233
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,260
like increase your water intake and just take a couple seconds out of your day to

234
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,460
look after yourself, take care of yourself, do something for you for once.

235
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,340
Do some sit ups, put a mirror on the floor and then squat over it and then like really

236
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,780
get a good look in there.

237
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,700
In where?

238
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,820
Where?

239
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,820
In your gay-per?

240
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,420
Is that what you're saying to me?

241
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,420
I say, you know, in the deep dark pit that is your chain.

242
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,260
You gotta love, you gotta love the skin you're in, Dove.

243
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,020
I think everybody has had the experience of maybe getting out of the shower or something

244
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,620
or being nude for some reason and getting up or going to like change or something and

245
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,620
you get a look of yourself, like you get a look of yourself in the mirror that's like,

246
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,820
I did not know I had that angle, you know, like I did not know that was part of my look.

247
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,540
Yeah, I feel like I, yes, for me I feel like it's precipitously just getting, I feel like

248
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,420
I've aged like 10 years in the past three months.

249
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,540
I don't know what it is, I just look at my skin and it's just sallow and I don't feel

250
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,700
great about myself, I guess is what I'm saying.

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,660
Well, you know what I do, I have rampant narcissism and so I just think I'm fucking awesome.

252
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Yeah, that helps, I guess.

253
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,300
It does, it helps so much.

254
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,820
Yeah, Travis is a man that is very familiar with bathroom floor mirrors.

255
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,860
Oh God, yes.

256
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,420
In fact, my entire bathroom floor is just made of mirrors.

257
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,460
Yeah, cut out the middle man.

258
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,100
Yeah, the problem is it's really slippery.

259
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Oh man, do you guys want to Yahoo?

260
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,700
Yes, please.

261
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,500
Crab-solutely.

262
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,860
What?

263
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,500
That's my new thing where I pretend I'm a crab.

264
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,300
Uh-huh.

265
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,780
Is this going to be the-

266
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,940
Crab-solutely, it's all like crab puns, like crab-solutely and you got to be crabbing me

267
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
and I'm feeling kind of crabby.

268
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how is you got to be crabbing me a pun?

269
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,460
It's a pun on shitting.

270
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,420
Is that like smurfing me?

271
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,900
Uh-huh.

272
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,460
I got you.

273
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,540
Oh, okay, so I see, so it's like crabbing is like a noun and a verb and an adverb and an adjective

274
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,260
and-

275
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah.

276
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,940
I'm tired of all these crabbing crabsikins taking all our jobs.

277
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,140
Oh, it's also racist.

278
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,380
Like a racist crab.

279
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,180
Guys, my boyfriend wants me to crab on him.

280
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,680
What?

281
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,800
What?

282
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,980
Oscar Pistorius crabbed his wife.

283
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,220
No.

284
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,500
Crabbed his crab.

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,180
Is that funny?

286
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,460
And then they put him in the crab electric chair.

287
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,940
But you just said electric on the end of crab.

288
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,400
Okay.

289
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,260
Griffin, do you want to go ahead and crab this question?

290
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,860
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

291
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,300
The prodigal son returns.

292
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,460
Why did you say it like a creepy accountant?

293
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,500
Well, because that's his punishment for not making it on the show lately.

294
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,500
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user, Risha, who asks, are there any phone apps that you

295
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,420
can download to make your butt look bigger or make your butt bigger?

296
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,260
To make your butt look bigger or make your butt bigger?

297
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,900
What a wide gulf between perception and reality.

298
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,980
This person does not seem to grasp it.

299
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,700
Are you saying like an application that can bend reality to your-

300
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,300
Like, okay, what if she's asking to make it appear bigger or something?

301
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
It makes your butt bigger, but it does not appear bigger.

302
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,820
She's fine either way.

303
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,780
Man, we're getting into some string theory shit, though.

304
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,060
That's some Schrodinger's cat.

305
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,460
If Schrodinger's cat had a fat ass-

306
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,300
Just put your ass in a box.

307
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,220
And then depending on if somebody looks at it or not, it may or may not be bigger.

308
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,020
It is dead in both universes.

309
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,820
Or wait, it's alive.

310
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,660
How is Schrodinger's-

311
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,020
One butt cheek is alive and one butt cheek is dead.

312
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,500
I get like that sometimes when I sit weird at the movies.

313
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,460
What you gotta watch out for is when one butt cheek consumes the other one within the box.

314
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,060
Let's make this simpler.

315
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course there are 5,000 iPhone apps that make your butt look bigger.

316
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,260
There are 5,000 competing companies.

317
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:18,660
There's a startup company that began in San Francisco that was completely originated.

318
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,380
Somebody's full-time employment is Funny Butt Cam, which is an app.

319
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,460
There's Funny Butt Cam, there's iButt.

320
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,540
There's iButt, which is fighting against it.

321
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,980
And they actually have a copyright suit against it.

322
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,540
It's a lot of Silicon Valley politicking.

323
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,420
I don't-

324
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,580
Let's take quick odds on iButt being an actual app available right now in the App Store.

325
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,620
One to one.

326
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:43,860
Okay.

327
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,020
It is a statistical-

328
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,460
I would say zero to one.

329
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,780
Let's do a parlay.

330
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,100
What does it do?

331
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,020
Is it just another fart piano?

332
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,620
Is it a Funny Butt Cam?

333
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,300
What are we talking about?

334
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,620
I bet it's something that you could take pictures of your friends

335
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,500
and somehow superimpose butts onto their faces.

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,060
Oh, I see.

337
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,460
Or maybe it just erases their shorts.

338
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,300
I think you would just call that Butt Head, right?

339
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,700
Yeah.

340
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,140
Oh, that's a better name.

341
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,020
Or Butt Face.

342
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,060
Butt Face is probably-

343
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,540
Butt Facebook is probably a good way to go.

344
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,740
Butt Facebook!

345
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,540
Sure, why not?

346
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,020
This is an untapped market.

347
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,820
Yeah.

348
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,060
I guess I feel like this is like a quantum thing

349
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,380
where as we even consider the possibility of these different things,

350
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,100
they simultaneously become extant.

351
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,380
Okay, super quick.

352
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,740
I tried to search for iButt and it suggested I search instead for

353
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,020
iButterfly, which is very different.

354
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,260
Yeah.

355
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,380
A much different approach to the whole big fat ass thing.

356
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,180
There are no apps called iButt, which I assume has to be old Steve.

357
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,860
But what Travis is saying is that by saying it,

358
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,860
there is a JavaScript programmer right now furiously typing out

359
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,340
what he needs to get iButt on the market before the episode is over.

360
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,460
Uh-huh.

361
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,140
Who's listening in though?

362
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,500
That's their fucking spies everywhere, man.

363
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,020
Thanks, WikiLeaks.

364
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,140
Thanks, WikiLeaks.

365
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,500
I've been using my fitness pal to help me shed the LBs.

366
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,420
17 LBs in 2013 as of last Wednesday.

367
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,700
That's so dope.

368
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,740
Thank you very much.

369
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,340
Why don't you get my fitness enemy?

370
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,100
Okay, my fitness enemy not only tracks the special kind of foods that you eat

371
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,620
to get that fat ass, because we know it's out there.

372
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,060
We know those foods exist.

373
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,100
A lot of legumes.

374
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,260
And then also the exercises that you don't do

375
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,660
and the special way that you sit at the movies that makes your butt cheeks bigger.

376
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,500
I would like to play that game where it's like,

377
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,500
today I didn't do a million squats and I definitely didn't do a thousand sit-ups.

378
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,900
We can-

379
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
Oh, good work.

380
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,700
That's a half a point each.

381
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,940
You have a billion points now.

382
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,580
We could somehow work the gyroscope inside the iPhone into the app.

383
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,900
So if it detects that you're moving around, it's like,

384
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,100
chill the fuck out, skinny, skinny person.

385
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,340
And there's like a Siri-like voice that sometimes just comes on and goes,

386
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,780
yeah, have some pizza.

387
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:14,660
What?

388
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,060
Don't worry about it.

389
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,580
Finish your plate, Daniel.

390
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,700
Daniel, Daniel, it's your fitness enemy.

391
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,860
Finish your plate, Daniel.

392
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,780
It's also got a pedometer function that shocks you every time you take a step.

393
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,260
Yeah.

394
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,500
So with every step-

395
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,260
The electrodes are attached to your butt cheeks.

396
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,740
It's double function because when you zap them,

397
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,020
it tenses and releases and it strengthens and tones.

398
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,660
I bet you that there is also an app out there that vibrates at a certain frequency

399
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
that like the creator of the app says,

400
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,140
if you put this on your butt, it'll get bigger.

401
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,460
Or your pee- or your pee-pee or like whatever.

402
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Oh, definitely, yeah.

403
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,180
It's just sending him pictures of your butt.

404
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,540
Mm-hmm, but like super close up.

405
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,460
It would just be a black screen, but they would know.

406
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,660
He knows.

407
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,860
I know exactly what that is.

408
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,540
I believe that's fifth quadrant, if I'm not mistaken.

409
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Why?

410
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,380
Why?

411
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,220
Travis has cut the human butt into butcher-style cuts.

412
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,260
I also want to say that there's someone out there right now listening going,

413
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,180
quadrants are in fours, you asshole.

414
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,180
Hence, fifth quadrant.

415
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,860
Fifth quadrant is the secret tasty part of the butt.

416
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,580
That's the part, you can't get that from the butcher unless you know him real well.

417
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,340
And only then you've got to have already been going there for like two or three years.

418
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,180
You have to have an apple corer and the will to never give up.

419
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,860
And then finally get to the fifth quadrant.

420
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,060
You get to the fifth quadrant.

421
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,180
You eat that piece of butt.

422
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,500
It's like the alien surgery scene in Independence Day.

423
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,100
The problem is it is like the fugu fish where if you get the wrong cut of butt, you're dead.

424
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,980
If you eat even a portion of the fourth quadrant of the butt, kiss it goodbye.

425
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,700
Quite literally.

426
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,140
You will have a butt there.

427
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,660
A portion of the first quadrant, well that's just social suicide.

428
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,180
What are you, a poor person?

429
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,820
Now if you get in that second quadrant, sex.

430
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,860
That as we all know is the athrodisiac quantity of the butt.

431
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,740
No, I meant like that's a butthole.

432
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,420
Okay, good.

433
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,460
Good, wonderful.

434
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,820
Just saying people do that.

435
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Wait, people actually can't technically, like from a physics point of view,

436
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,100
people can't eat buttholes.

437
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,380
It's very, that's why.

438
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,460
They can't eat the absence of thing.

439
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,980
They can't eat the absence of butt.

440
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,380
I guess you ate my butthole.

441
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,700
You can, but you're so hungry after it.

442
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,300
I don't have a hole down there anymore.

443
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,300
It's just a continuum of flesh.

444
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,020
The only thing they can eat buttholes is the langoliers.

445
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,300
Because they can actually, they bend space and time.

446
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,580
You know Alfred Hitchcock doesn't have a belly button.

447
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,180
Is that true?

448
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,700
Yeah, it's true.

449
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
That's because he's dead.

450
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,420
Well, okay.

451
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,460
Yeah, okay.

452
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,220
He doesn't have a lot of things anymore.

453
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Okay, but no, yeah, he had surgery when he was a kid

454
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,100
and they sewed up his belly button.

455
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,300
So he didn't have a belly button.

456
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,900
So he's just like a matryoshka doll or whatever it's called.

457
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,540
You can just stack multiple Alfred Hitchcock inside one of them.

458
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,980
Um, man, I bet that they're, I feel like most of the people

459
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,860
that buy apps, and like I buy a shit ton of apps,

460
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,660
but like I just have this feeling that most of the people

461
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,260
that buy apps are dumb.

462
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,660
And so I really do think that this vibration,

463
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,540
we could get like a doctor to sign off on it and be like,

464
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,220
yeah, put that on your dip, on your dipstick,

465
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,580
and it's going to increase in size.

466
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,340
Take it from me, doctor, doctor.

467
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,140
Wait, so we've somehow veered from edible butt parts

468
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,980
to an app that makes your dick bigger?

469
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,820
Or your butt or whatever you put on it.

470
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,260
Maybe you put it on your muscle.

471
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,860
It vibrates it and the doctor says it works.

472
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,460
With that kind of power, what if you like left it on your pinky

473
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,220
for too long and then you got a giant pinky finger.

474
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,700
Oh yeah, oh man, it'd be rough.

475
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,820
It'd be like the end of Akira.

476
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,900
You'd just flood a whole city with your body.

477
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,100
Do you think there's a metal detector app?

478
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,500
See, that's exactly the kind of shit I'm talking about.

479
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,940
Like, point your camera at the ground.

480
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,220
We can tell when there's metal in it.

481
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,820
Like you suit, you wicked can't.

482
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,740
You totally can't.

483
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,300
Okay, there definitely is.

484
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,020
And it says for fun only.

485
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah, okay.

486
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,340
So no business, no business applications?

487
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,300
No business applications for this imaginary metal detector.

488
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,260
Okay, fine.

489
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,020
But I was gonna do science.

490
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,140
Ah, damn it.

491
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,260
Quiet, I'm downloading it.

492
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,980
And you need full focus to do that?

493
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,940
How do you download stuff on your iPhone?

494
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,780
Hold on, I have to stare at it to make it work.

495
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,460
I gotta remember my password.

496
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,300
He hand checks each bit and bite.

497
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,900
Yes, yeah.

498
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,100
I made my password deliberately difficult to remember and enter

499
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,420
to prevent myself from drunk buying any more apps.

500
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,860
I need a metal detector.

501
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
An online textbook, $60.

502
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,700
Sure thing.

503
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,900
First review.

504
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

505
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,740
First review, it is a fake.

506
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,300
It goes by the way you tilt your iPhone.

507
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,180
Second review, works for most metals.

508
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,460
Okay, guys.

509
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,140
That is obviously like a plant.

510
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,420
But if you're gonna get a plant, why is that plant like,

511
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,260
I don't know, it's cobalt, just fine.

512
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,460
But 10, it can't seem to, doesn't seem to grok 10.

513
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,980
But it got cobalt for me, so.

514
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,420
Oh my God.

515
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,220
Here's a great review, delete it.

516
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,980
Does not work on any iPad touch and that is five stars.

517
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,820
Perfect.

518
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
It is great in its horribleness.

519
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,500
Oh man.

520
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,700
Let's get another question from one of our beloved readers.

521
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,060
What do you guys say?

522
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,460
No.

523
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm a straight lady that happens to be very picky about the guys I date.

524
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,940
So I've been single for a long time.

525
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,580
My bestie, who's significantly less picky,

526
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,620
interpreted my longstanding singleness as asexuality.

527
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,980
Or at least I think she has.

528
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,900
Anytime someone hits on me or I hit on someone around her,

529
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,300
she practically shouts out I'm asexual until they go away.

530
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,540
She expects me to thank her for saving me from them.

531
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,740
She also makes jokes about how asexual I am constantly.

532
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,180
I don't want her shoving guys in my face, but this is out of control.

533
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,660
How can I explain to her that I'm not asexual

534
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,060
without her thinking I'm hiding in the closet?

535
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,500
That's from Persnickety in Ohio.

536
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,860
Why don't you just say it?

537
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,260
Why don't you just say get the fuck?

538
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,580
What the fuck are you doing there misery?

539
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,340
Because you're fucking creeping me out.

540
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Hey Sharon, maybe don't bring it up.

541
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,700
You can feel that way all you want to,

542
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,340
but maybe that's not the opening line when you see me talking to a fella.

543
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,460
Hey, maybe like you've had kind of a cold streak

544
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,260
because your friend Sharon tells everybody you're asexual.

545
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,740
Yeah, you dug that your vagina grew over.

546
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,100
Maybe that's the issue.

547
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm not like a relationship scientist or anything, but that seems probable.

548
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,260
I will also say that it's kind of offensive that there's a population,

549
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,780
the segment of the population that is actually living with asexuality.

550
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,980
This is like a group of people.

551
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,860
It's not like a goof.

552
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,420
There's like actual asexual people.

553
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Yeah, it's not like a cool thing for you to be like,

554
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,540
oh, she doesn't sleep with anyone.

555
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,900
She's totally asexual.

556
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,660
That's like an actual thing.

557
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,460
Hey dog.

558
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,340
You know, they've got their own struggles trying to get accepted in society

559
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,980
without your friend Sharon trying to pussy block you at every turn.

560
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,300
Yeah.

561
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,260
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,460
Is that like the acceptable thing for cock blocking?

563
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,940
I could come up with way worse terms.

564
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,340
I know you could.

565
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,260
No, I want to hear like three of them.

566
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh God.

567
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,500
Lip zipping.

568
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,260
No, I don't want to hear half of one.

569
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,220
Ladies and gentlemen, Travis Patrick McElroy.

570
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,940
Thank you very much.

571
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,100
Thank you.

572
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,620
Oh no, they can find a social now.

573
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,700
Social, social.

574
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,460
Oh, that's rough.

575
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,900
This is so fucking sta-

576
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,140
This seems like this isn't even to me a conundrum.

577
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Just say the fucking shit and be like,

578
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,540
hey, I need you to cut that shit out.

579
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,860
Yeah.

580
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,580
Not only is it not cool,

581
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,620
but it's also making me less likely to find someone

582
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,940
that I actually meets my high standards.

583
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,140
You know what I mean?

584
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,540
Like, your friend is unless.

585
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,340
Unless.

586
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,380
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

587
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,060
She's trying to Mulholland drive you.

588
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,860
Oh no.

589
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
That's probably not true though.

590
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,220
Well, there's also the possibility that you,

591
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,060
okay, this is awful,

592
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:48,500
but I'm going to tell you that maybe you are unconsciously wing manning Sharon.

593
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,980
Wait a minute.

594
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,540
What?

595
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,780
You're going out to these bars together.

596
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,100
Shit.

597
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,500
Okay.

598
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,700
So, no, this one pretty much doesn't even have a vagina.

599
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,060
I'm Sharon, by the way.

600
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,500
This is what, oh man.

601
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,300
I'm just saying that Sharon may enjoy having someone

602
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
that is not on the pursuit.

603
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,620
They're just talking her up and making her look good.

604
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,220
So you're getting the guys all heated up, right?

605
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,620
Sharon is poaching.

606
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,220
Oh my God, you're right.

607
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm just saying, like, she likes you as her partner in crime going out on the town

608
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
because you're not a threat to her game.

609
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,100
That all makes perfect sense to me.

610
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,900
It does it though.

611
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,380
But I'm upset that maybe we've been doing this show for too long as a result.

612
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
Should that make sense?

613
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,220
Now we have to ask a question.

614
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,500
It totally makes sense.

615
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,540
Yeah, okay.

616
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,580
Yeah, it's because everyone in the world is devious.

617
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,660
Everybody's got secrets.

618
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,140
Well, I'm okay.

619
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,700
Okay, everybody does have secret.

620
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,180
I mean, like, she probably just thinks, okay.

621
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,780
We are all so sort of lost with how to behave in public

622
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,460
that I think that there's part of us that likes having like a bit, you know, that you can do.

623
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,980
Like a routine, something that's comfortable where you kind of like,

624
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,260
oh yeah, that's kind of our bit.

625
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:12,180
So when we go out, our bit is I, you know, I pretend she's asexual and she's not.

626
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,020
I don't actually know what the conclusion of the bit is, but...

627
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,740
The person fucks the guy that this girl was trying to hook up with.

628
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,940
That's the conclusion.

629
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,460
That's how it shakes out, right?

630
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,900
Yeah, I don't know.

631
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,300
I think it just sucks no matter what.

632
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,940
Even if she thinks she's being harmless, like it's still kind of a bitchy thing to do.

633
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,900
It is, it sucks.

634
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,340
Yeah, I think you just need to...

635
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,700
Unless, unless she's trying to set you up as like, can't fuck this.

636
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,220
You know what I mean?

637
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,980
Oh, she's putting her on a pedestal preemptively.

638
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,300
This is what I'm saying.

639
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,620
It's not what I'm saying though, cause it's the dumbest.

640
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,580
Let's just say it.

641
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,300
Get it out there.

642
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,300
I, if you say that this person doesn't have sexual, then the person, if the person is

643
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,980
the right kind of person, or by which I mean the wrongest person ever, they might say,

644
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,540
well, I can get some sexual in there.

645
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:13,940
I bet.

646
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,500
Let me see.

647
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,060
I bet I can.

648
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,620
Let me, you haven't seen what I do in there up and around it.

649
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,900
Let me find out.

650
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,060
Maybe you're just Dansexual and hold on.

651
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,940
Let Dan find out what's going on in there.

652
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,540
Maybe this whole time you've been Dansexual.

653
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,740
Might I suggest Dan?

654
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,660
Hey, don't be Danphobic.

655
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:32,980
This is...

656
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,580
Let me break you off some Dan, just real quick.

657
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,660
Just the taste of the flavor.

658
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:48,180
You know what they say, once you go Dan, hey, did you try the flan?

659
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,820
Cause Dan makes flan for you after he makes love to you.

660
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
Dan's the flan man, don't even worry about it.

661
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,260
That's basically Dan's calling card.

662
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,580
If you smell flan, you know Dan's been fucking.

663
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,420
Do you want to fuck Dan and eat some flan?

664
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,980
Oh, what's that?

665
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,020
You don't like flan?

666
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,740
I understand.

667
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
The weirdest Dr. Seuss book ever.

668
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,300
Dan the man with the flan plan, fucking.

669
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,540
Dan's about two things, fucking and eating flan and we're all out of flan.

670
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,420
On his deathbed, Dr. Seuss handed that book to his publisher, like, wait till you-

671
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,060
Dr. Seuss is like, listen, I know, I know I told you that I didn't have any more books.

672
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,860
I said I was out the game, but wait till you hear my new shit.

673
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,460
I know I've been battling with mild dementia, but I believe this is my magnum opus.

674
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,220
That bitch is fine.

675
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,180
Let me know what you think.

676
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,340
It's like that scene in Proof.

677
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,740
It's from the notebook.

678
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,220
This is just pictures of a guy fucking some flan.

679
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,180
He had so many characters, Dan the flan fucking man.

680
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,100
What do you think?

681
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
What do you think, Seuss Incorporated?

682
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,060
Can I get another hit?

683
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,020
No.

684
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,380
We are already building the ride at Universal.

685
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,020
We're about to edit this more than the original story for Hop on Pop.

686
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,220
You're on fire today.

687
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,700
I know.

688
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,380
Absolutely.

689
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,820
Just keep passing him the rock.

690
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,620
Speaking of fucking flan, do you guys want to go to the Money Zone?

691
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,580
That's who I am.

692
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,860
We got a message from Marissa Yoko Hankins.

693
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,060
Either that's her actual name or she told her group of friends.

694
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,980
We'll probably never know the truth.

695
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,420
Now she's OG.

696
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,180
I recognize that Twitter tag.

697
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,220
Cassie Rosenbrock is who this message is from and she says, happy 26, Marissa.

698
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,660
She's hilarious and kind.

699
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,180
She works with nuns and she doesn't even use swears around them.

700
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,940
She has a complicated dog named Tofu.

701
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,180
She's converted everyone she knows to an NBNBAM fan, presumably not the nuns.

702
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,540
Well, yes, I don't see anything wrong with this.

703
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,220
And she deserves the best NBNBAM wish money can buy.

704
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,060
So happy birthday.

705
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,740
Happy birthday, Marissa.

706
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,060
Happy birthday, here's your flan.

707
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,020
I hope you have a crab-solutely wonderful birthday.

708
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,900
No, no.

709
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,660
Trav, hit me with this new one.

710
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,420
Hey, do you guys like iPhone games?

711
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,140
Yeah.

712
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,940
How about Bowt?

713
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,100
Tell me about it.

714
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,140
It sounds cool.

715
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,340
Wait, wait, hold on.

716
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,220
Tell me Bowt it.

717
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,820
I'll tell you Bowt Bowt.

718
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,700
Bowt is a photo taking game you play with friends.

719
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,180
It's made by Awkward Hug and College Humor.

720
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,940
So that's pretty awesome right there.

721
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,380
And Awkward Hug are huge My Brother, My Brother, and Me fans.

722
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,580
I wrote a post about this game the other day.

723
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,380
I had no idea that they were part of the-

724
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,580
Oh, shit.

725
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,380
Cross Pro.

726
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,780
I know.

727
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,540
The NBNBAM Illuminati group.

728
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,260
I don't know.

729
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,980
Skulls and Bonin.

730
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,820
What do we call our secret fans?

731
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,140
Like our fans-

732
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,900
I said Skulls and Bonin.

733
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,940
Okay, Skulls and Bonin.

734
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,020
The Illuma- The Illuma-naughty.

735
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,500
So in Bowt, I'll explain the rules because they just didn't do it.

736
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,260
But luckily, I have that knowledge.

737
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,020
By the way, maybe you should hire some marketing PR because

738
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,500
you obviously don't know how to write promotional spots on comedy podcasts.

739
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,460
You set up a category like do your best Spider-Man

740
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,420
and then all your friends take pictures of themselves doing the best Spider-Man

741
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,500
and then the judge votes on the best picture.

742
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,820
That's such a good idea.

743
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,060
Yeah.

744
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,540
I like that a lot.

745
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,180
It's fun.

746
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,020
So it's just B-O-U-T?

747
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,300
Check it out.

748
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,420
Get it on the iTunes store.

749
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,740
Yeah.

750
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,060
I'm gonna-

751
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,060
You're gonna be bad about it.

752
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,420
This next one, I'm gonna say I'm very excited about.

753
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,780
Oh, hit me, Trav.

754
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm ready.

755
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,660
You need to visit corndogday.com and order your party pack.

756
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,100
Click on party pack button and get it.

757
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Seriously, get it.

758
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Happy National Corn Dog Day, everybody.

759
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,300
National Corn Dog Day is March 23rd.

760
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,020
What's that?

761
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,540
It's a day to gather friends,

762
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,220
watch the college basketball tournament,

763
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,460
and eat fucking corndogs.

764
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,780
Lots and lots of corndogs.

765
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,380
Forget feats of strength.

766
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,900
Try the triple double.

767
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,860
Ten corndogs, ten beer, and eight hun-

768
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,900
No, sorry.

769
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,140
And a hundred tater tots.

770
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,640
Four.

771
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,260
I heard everything.

772
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,540
Susan, it happened again.

773
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
God damn this holiday.

774
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,420
Ten corndogs, ten beers, a hundred tater tots,

775
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,940
in a single afternoon.

776
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,980
Many have tried.

777
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,180
Few have achieved.

778
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,380
Ramp up the ultimate celebration on meat on sticks

779
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,700
by ordering a corndog day party pack.

780
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,900
The party pack have coupons for free boxes of corndogs,

781
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,540
posters, t-shirts, and other fun stuff.

782
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,940
So go to corndogday.com and get it.

783
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
What the fuck, you guys?

784
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,620
Isn't that awesome?

785
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,060
It's- but it doesn't make-

786
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
I get like the national dairy farmers

787
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
like doing commercials for milk and shit,

788
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,780
but like corndog seems pretty esoteric

789
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,500
to have its own-

790
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,700
Brought to you by the council for corndogs.

791
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,180
I guess.

792
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,900
I mean, man, I haven't eaten a corndog

793
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,580
in a fucking grip though.

794
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:10,980
I know.

795
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,860
Oh, man.

796
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,380
I want one really bad now.

797
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,660
Yeah, like when you-

798
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,780
corndogs are one of those things

799
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,340
where if you don't think about them a lot,

800
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,540
well, you're like most people,

801
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,500
but when you do think about them,

802
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,260
sometimes you just get fixated.

803
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,980
Yeah, it's like when you hear hooves

804
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,860
and you think zebra, then you're-

805
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,060
You wanna eat a zebra dog.

806
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,500
You're legally insane.

807
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,900
Look at this art on the front page of corndog day

808
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,740
that I just put in the Skype window, guys.

809
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,420
It's like giant, this brawny woodman

810
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,860
is airlifting giant corndogs into a truck.

811
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,780
And now all I can think about is eating a corndog.

812
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,740
They'll kill you in a day,

813
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,420
but now I want 10 corndogs,

814
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,300
10 beers and 800 datadogs.

815
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,460
So we hear you wanna make your butt bigger.

816
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,420
Well, we've got a recipe for you.

817
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,620
It's the Ass Stopper XXL Butt Plug

818
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,260
brought to you by ExtremeRestraints.com.

819
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,500
Now for just $55, we're gonna get you into a butt plug.

820
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,300
Well, no, sorry.

821
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,380
We're gonna get a butt plug in you.

822
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,020
What's it gonna take for me to get this butt plug in you?

823
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,220
Mom, dark it down.

824
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,420
Before you leave our storeroom floor today,

825
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,260
I wanna put this butt plug in you.

826
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,420
Now let me give you guys some perspective here

827
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,220
because I feel like as we mature,

828
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,620
that is the most valuable thing we glean.

829
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,060
The Ass Stopper is a super huge butt plug.

830
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,020
Now this is from the experts.

831
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,900
That's its gauge.

832
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,580
That's its official gauge, right?

833
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,220
That's its gauge.

834
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,700
That's from the experts at ExtremeRestraints.com.

835
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,180
It's a super huge butt plug

836
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,220
and it stands about nine inches high

837
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,540
and its widest point is five inches wide.

838
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,500
Justin, no kidding.

839
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,420
This thing is enormous.

840
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,620
This thing looks like a...

841
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,580
I'm looking at it

842
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,460
and there's an unshirted gentleman holding it

843
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,100
and he looks like he's accepting a CableAce award.

844
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,620
It is a massive...

845
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,900
He looks tired.

846
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,460
He looks like he's suffering back problems from...

847
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,860
You see his tendons straining under the weight

848
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,540
of this three pound butt plug

849
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,300
and yes, I did say three pounds of filling pleasure.

850
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,580

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
If you're not supposed to show it in public,

857
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,460
ExtremeRestraints has got something to stick in it

858
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,420

So if you wanna do it raw and real...

865
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,020
Have you been searching all over the internet

866
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,780
for videos of people having sex

867
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,460
but just haven't been able to find them?

868
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,940
Don't worry.

869
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,180
There's a whole video about dominant diva.

870
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,260
There's one about male chastity.

871
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,740
There's one which actually I think I saw that

872
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,780
in church camp once, that male chastity video.

873
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,700
I think we signed a pledge and got some rings

874
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,740
if I remember correctly.

875
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,580
Right, but the ring wasn't a tiny cage

876
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,740
that you put around your penis with a sign on it.

877
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,460
It says bad.

878
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,860
It might've been, I didn't look.

879
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,700

Good luck not jerking off.

883
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,060
Next question.

884
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,700
Friends are constantly telling me

885
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,140
I should move away from Oklahoma

886
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,820
cause there's nothing here for me.

887
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,420
I understand there's a lot to do

888
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,940
and experience in other parts of the country

889
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,460
but I spent my whole life here.

890
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,980
Currently planning on going back to school

891
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,700
getting a master's in education, teaching English

892
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,740
which would give me plenty of time

893
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,940
during the summer, winter, spring breaks

894
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,380
to travel and see the better states.

895
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,540
That's better in quotes by the way.

896
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,220
Will I regret not moving out of okay

897
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,340
and seeing what else is out there?

898
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,060
Additional details.

899
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,020
I'm a musician.

900
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,300
People tell me I'll never have the chance

901
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,340
to blow up if I stay here

902
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,740
but I think I get to play plenty.

903
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,620
Are people just projecting their ambitions on me?

904
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
That's from OK Oklahoma.

905
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Man, this is gonna get real.

906
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,580
Yeah, they are projecting their ambitions onto you

907
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,900
which is what we are about to do also.

908
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,540
Brace your ears.

909
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,340
Maybe.

910
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,420
Travis, give us some perspective on Oklahoma first.

911
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,820
I'm gonna say this because having been from,

912
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,980
lived in both Oklahoma and West Virginia

913
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,940
two of the most shatter upon states in the union.

914
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,020
I think that my take on it is that

915
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,700
every state is more or less the same.

916
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
If you discount California and New York

917
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,340
every state is just about the same.

918
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,540
They have big cities like two or three,

919
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,940
you know, maybe more big cities

920
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,100
and then lots of open space in between.

921
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,940
You know what I mean?

922
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,060
Like I look at Ohio and it's got, you know

923
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,980
Columbus and Cincinnati and Cleveland

924
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,420
which are huge cities.

925
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,100
If you drive like 10 minutes

926
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,180
or they're relatively large cities.

927
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,580
If you drive 10 minutes outside of Cincinnati

928
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,620
there ain't nothing.

929
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,060
Yeah, it's a fart hole.

930
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,860
I mean, it's the same driving into Chicago and Illinois.

931
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,780
You know, you drive from Cincinnati to there.

932
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,300
You hit Chicago, it's gigantic

933
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,140
but like 20 miles outside of Chicago, it's farmland.

934
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,060
Yeah, but I think what's more important

935
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,700
than just Oklahoma.

936
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,540
I think that the point of,

937
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,060
if you are, if you are, here's what I'll say.

938
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,460
If you are having any doubts at all about it

939
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,820
you definitely, definitely need to look around.

940
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,660
Like you definitely need to do a tour

941
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,460
like you're planning on.

942
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,980
Cause like you really won't know

943
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,380
what is best for you out there

944
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,180
until you, until you look

945
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,580
like that's the only way that you can check it out

946
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,620
and look in earnest.

947
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,460
I think it's a great point, Griffin.

948
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,340
I think you can, you can get conditioned to one area

949
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,060
and think that other areas are,

950
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,300
they become more foreign to you

951
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,220
and that you think, well, I could never be at home there.

952
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,100
So I would heartily recommend,

953
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,780
I mean, like obviously I've decided to,

954
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,580
to settle here in West Virginia.

955
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,020
I've been all over.

956
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,500
I mean, I've been to most of the major American cities

957
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,460
and I've, I've checked it out.

958
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,580
I've seen what's going on

959
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,020
and I've, I've, you know, I've always wanted to come back here.

960
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,940
You got, you got scared by all the cars.

961
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,020
It's like, what are the, what are these Triceratops?

962
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,660
Like, I don't know.

963
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,820
What are these fire breathing?

964
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,620
I don't know.

965
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,100
The thing is, is like, I think the important thing

966
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,220
to keep in mind is end up where the best,

967
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,220
like the best setting for what you want to do.

968
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,700
You know what I mean?

969
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,780
So for example, if you want to teach,

970
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,340
you know, college English,

971
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,300
make sure you settle down near a college

972
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,900
that has a good English department.

973
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,340
And not in Chicago,

974
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,900
because it's very hard to get a teaching job there.

975
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,220
Yeah, but if you want to do music,

976
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,900
if you want to go the music route,

977
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,500
then yeah, you probably don't want to end up

978
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,540
in Norman, Oklahoma.

979
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,100
Yeah.

980
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,340
That said, that said, like, you know,

981
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,780
I know lots of people that they live in smaller towns

982
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,060
and they play at bars and they play music festivals.

983
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,140
And maybe that's like fun for you.

984
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,980
Like you can just, I mean, yeah,

985
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,820
you're not going to blow up. Like, do you want to?

986
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,340
That seems really hard.

987
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,620
It seems really hard to be like a big, gigantic rock star.

988
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,140
It seems like the odds are probably,

989
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,820
see that, that is my only problem

990
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,980
with people moving to giant cities,

991
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,180
banking, like a huge, a very unlikely career on them.

992
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,020
You know, like if you want to,

993
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,620
first off with the internet,

994
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,780
now you can have a music career outside of New York,

995
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,660
LA, Chicago.

996
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,460
I mean, you can sell music direct to people

997
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,940
and build a following that way.

998
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,500
And yeah, I mean, eventually you'll probably need to tour

999
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,860
if you start to catch on.

1000
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,140
But like, you look at a musician like Jonathan Colton,

1001
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,100
he built his following completely online

1002
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,140
before he ever started.

1003
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,660
Well, that's what Brent did.

1004
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,220
Sure, yeah.

1005
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah, that's what Brent did.

1006
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,380
Well, he started on YouTube

1007
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,820
and now he very rarely actually performs in New York.

1008
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,780
He travels to conferences and does all that.

1009
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,180
You know, I reminded my friend Maggie,

1010
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,940
her dad is a standup comic.

1011
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,420
He started when he was like 30, 35, kind of late,

1012
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,140
a little bit late.

1013
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,860
And he makes his living entirely off of doing standup comedy

1014
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,540
and he just tours, you know?

1015
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,460
He'll stop and play a week somewhere

1016
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,620
and then go home and, you know, be home for a while

1017
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,060
and that's how he makes his living.

1018
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,620
And he, you know, lives in Oklahoma

1019
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,100
and, you know, you just tour to other places.

1020
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,580
He's got kids all up and down 66, I bet.

1021
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,100
I'm saying your friend's dad is an adulterer.

1022
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,020
No, no, I picked that up after I agreed with it.

1023
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,820
Now I feel awful.

1024
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,540
Yeah.

1025
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,060
But it's one of those things where,

1026
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,580
like, you make your own scenario, dude.

1027
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,460
You know what I mean?

1028
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,340
So if you want to stay in Oklahoma and do other things,

1029
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,060
do it, you know?

1030
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,860
But that said, there are better environments

1031
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,060
for certain things.

1032
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,140
Like, if you want to work in the film industry,

1033
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,140
yeah, you probably shouldn't stay, you know, in Oklahoma.

1034
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,900
It's so hard to be happy.

1035
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,460
It is.

1036
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,700
And if you're happy in Oklahoma,

1037
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,260
like, fucking ride that comet, little prince.

1038
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,460
It couldn't be, like, that couldn't be,

1039
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,060
that's the most important thing.

1040
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,500
And it seems like such an obvious thing,

1041
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,340
but I had so many friends that left college or high school

1042
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,620
and said, like, I'm just going to move to this place

1043
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,140
because, you know, I think I could find a job there

1044
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,820
and be very successful.

1045
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,060
And none of them were especially happy.

1046
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,060
I don't know.

1047
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,180
That's why I kept moving around after I graduated

1048
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,900
because, I don't know, I just couldn't,

1049
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,380
I wasn't as happy as I am now in Austin.

1050
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,700
And I, like, I knew that it was out there.

1051
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,380
I just, it wasn't for me in Huntington or Cincinnati

1052
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,180
or Chicago.

1053
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,340
Like, I had to come here to find it.

1054
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,100
You know, Teresa and I have had a lot of discussions

1055
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,180
about this and I apologize to our listeners

1056
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,780
because, like, none of this is really funny.

1057
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,740
But Teresa and I had a conversation about this

1058
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,460
very early on.

1059
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,380
And the idea is, like, the thing to keep in mind is

1060
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,820
places don't make you happy.

1061
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,060
No.

1062
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,420
Like, you got to be happy in the place.

1063
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,580
The place can have shit that makes you happy.

1064
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,340
But, ultimately, humans, like, we don't need that much shit.

1065
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,420
Like, I need a few nice restaurants

1066
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,500
and a bar that I can go to that doesn't give me the creepos

1067
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,940
and a movie theater where all the people don't talk.

1068
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,100
And, literally, if I have all that shit

1069
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,620
and I'm basically set.

1070
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,420
Even if you talk to people who are in New York,

1071
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,260
you know, you ask them about, you know,

1072
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,260
what's your favorite Thai place?

1073
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,300
Well, there is the Thai place that is within two blocks of me.

1074
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,620
Right.

1075
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,980
And you'll ask about someplace else.

1076
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,300
I don't know.

1077
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,260
That's three blocks away.

1078
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,380
How can I know where that is?

1079
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,780
I don't know.

1080
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,820
What am I, a millionaire?

1081
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,540
I can't travel.

1082
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,260
You know, it's just like, you know,

1083
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,620
find a place that makes you happy.

1084
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,780
Now, if Oklahoma makes you happy, then, yeah,

1085
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,580
don't worry about it, dude.

1086
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,860
But if you find yourself, like, sighing out the window,

1087
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,060
then, yeah, maybe go explore.

1088
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,380
We're not.

1089
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,260
Go rambling.

1090
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,340
I don't mean to make it sound like we're shitting on New York.

1091
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,100
It's just like, I don't know.

1092
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,540
I think that it really does come down to the type of person

1093
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,420
you are.

1094
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,100
If you can put up with having way, way, way, way, way more shit

1095
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,940
in the place you live than you could possibly ever see,

1096
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,300
and as a result, sort of pay a convenience tax on that shit,

1097
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,540
like, yeah, there are 100 Thai places to go to.

1098
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,740
But like, buying groceries fucking sucks.

1099
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,300
Like, I think that if you are that kind of person,

1100
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,100
you can make that trade off.

1101
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,740
Go for it.

1102
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,820
Seriously, though, you have to look around.

1103
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,140
And I know that this has been kind of long and not funny,

1104
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,060
but I feel like this is, like, a huge issue that a lot of people

1105
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,780
We're a more mobile society than we've ever been before.

1106
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,260
Yes.

1107
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,660
It makes more sense than ever before, I think, too.

1108
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,820
It's never been easier to, like, stay in con—

1109
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,220
I mean, stay connected to the place you grew up

1110
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,820
and to the people that you love.

1111
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,540
And I think that makes us feel a lot more, you know,

1112
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,260
I think it puts more of an onus on you sometimes to travel

1113
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,180
because it, you know, you can still stay tethered to—

1114
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,460
Yeah, and I think it's also—

1115
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,940
I also think it's a social, you know, thing

1116
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,260
where there's kind of an understanding that, like,

1117
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,340
oh, if you really want to live it up,

1118
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,940
then you got to move somewhere bigger.

1119
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,580
Yeah, fuck that.

1120
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,460
Yeah, I think that's bullshit.

1121
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,860
There is no best city, like, period, except for Austin.

1122
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,540
You just have to find the best city for you,

1123
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,900
which is probably Austin.

1124
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,380
Okay, let's move on.

1125
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,060
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question for me?

1126
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,700
Yeah, I sure do.

1127
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,140
I've been waiting for it, and I think you know the one I need.

1128
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,660
Oh, I don't.

1129
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,220
This one was sent in by Brian Root.

1130
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,860
Thanks, Brian.

1131
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Machi, who asks,

1132
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,220
what are the consequences of brandishing a samurai sword in public?

1133
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,220
Can I just walk downtown with it without troubling anyone?

1134
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,980
I don't know, can you?

1135
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,580
I don't know.

1136
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,420
Since that's never happened before ever,

1137
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,460
it's hard to answer.

1138
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,660
I don't know, Time Ninja.

1139
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,980
Can you fucking keep it under wraps and keep your heels cool

1140
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,060
while you're walking down the street with that samurai sword?

1141
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,300
Wait, okay, wait, wait, wait.

1142
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,020
When he says brandishing, does he mean, like,

1143
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,020
on his belt?

1144
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,940
Or is he, like, he's walking around carrying it?

1145
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,340
He's walking full blown.

1146
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,500
Like, brandishing is out of the scabbard.

1147
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,420
Yeah, brandishing is out of the scabbard, like, shaking it at people.

1148
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,220
Right, scabbard in one hand, samurai sword in the other.

1149
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,260
I'm not troubling you.

1150
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,420
Holding them out, holding them aloft, full blown Michonne,

1151
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,700
just, like, ready to, looking like he's about to wreck shit.

1152
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:40,420
I think that I've never seen someone with a samurai sword

1153
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,660
scabbarded or unscabbarded.

1154
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,020
There, I wasn't troubled.

1155
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,060
I will be troubled.

1156
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,900
The trouble is inherent to having the samurai sword there.

1157
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,380
Unless you are a block away from San Diego Comic Con.

1158
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,940
But even then, it's like, go back to your fucking zoo.

1159
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,460
Then if you go half a block more,

1160
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,620
just a guy with a shotgun goes head on back now.

1161
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,500
Yep, nope, turn, turn right back around.

1162
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,740
He's going head on right on back.

1163
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,220
All right.

1164
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,620
Prison, I think, is a pretty, pretty solid consequence.

1165
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,780
See, I disagree, Griffin, and I think it's psychiatric counseling.

1166
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,380
I go, hey, so why did you think that was a good idea?

1167
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,340
Holy shit.

1168
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:29,060
This would be, like, an amazing movement against, like, gun nut people.

1169
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,820
As if, like, if people who don't like guns,

1170
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,460
why are they called anti-gun people?

1171
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,380
Just carrying around giant swords in public.

1172
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,420
And then the gun people are like, hey, you're making me super uncomfortable.

1173
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,740
And it's like, that's how that little thing in your belt makes me feel.

1174
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,300
I think what you have to do is you got to make sure,

1175
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,220
is there, like, some kind of government agency

1176
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,980
you go to to get a permit to carry your sword?

1177
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,380
There's got to be, right?

1178
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,140
You get a concealed carry for your gun.

1179
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,220
I think the True Love Weights card works pretty much the same way.

1180
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,420
Promise not to have sex.

1181
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,220
Yep.

1182
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,940
You got it.

1183
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,580
You got it.

1184
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,220
Here's your sword.

1185
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,220
That's what they should hand out at True Love Weights.

1186
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,100
Instead of a promise ring, you get a promise samurai sword

1187
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,700
because you are not having sex tonight.

1188
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,340
And here's either this or these steampunk goggles or this gesture hat.

1189
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,260
Man, fucking my kids will never believe high school in the aughts.

1190
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,940
There's a story called Hot Topic.

1191
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,980
It fucking sucked.

1192
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,580
No, surely that's just a story of legends.

1193
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,260
It was real.

1194
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:38,740
It sucked.

1195
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,500
Everything was really, really bad.

1196
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,500
It was a bad, bad time.

1197
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,660
It was a bad time, basically, for everybody.

1198
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,020
Nobody fucked.

1199
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,740
That's why the population dropped so significantly.

1200
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,020
Now hand me some of those MREs and some of the boiler water

1201
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,380
so we can continue to thrive in the Outlands.

1202
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,020
Let's see it.

1203
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,220
Thanks for nothing, Hot Topic.

1204
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,340
Here we wear our goggles unironically to protect ourselves from the radiation.

1205
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,860
That's in the death tornadoes.

1206
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,300
I wish we had samurai swords now because of the mutants.

1207
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,180
Hot Topic is going to sponsor children of men, too.

1208
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,740
And it's going to be like, no babies have been born.

1209
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,500
It's not because we stop fucking.

1210
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,540
It's just like, who wants to look at him?

1211
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,180
Look at him.

1212
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,700
He looks like a cyber clown.

1213
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,420
Clive Owen wearing ironic Super Mario t-shirt.

1214
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,340
Well, we're not fucking.

1215
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,300
His shirt has cat dog on it.

1216
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,740
It smells like Funyuns.

1217
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,300
I hate him.

1218
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,580
What happened to you, Clive Owen?

1219
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,660
You were in shoot him up.

1220
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,940
But now you're bracing that spikes on it.

1221
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,140
It's four inches wide.

1222
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,180
I'm having a hard time thinking about fucking you

1223
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,180
because you're playing Dance Dance Revolution.

1224
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:54,660
Can we go?

1225
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,220
Can we go?

1226
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,900
Can you put me in your giant black denim jean pocket and carry me away?

1227
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,140
Like a kangaroo.

1228
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,100
We done?

1229
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,420
Yep.

1230
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,060
Is that it?

1231
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,860
Enough jokes?

1232
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,180
All right.

1233
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,620
This has been My Brother, My Brother Meets an Advice Show for the Modern Era.

1234
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,620
We thank you so much for listening to it and enjoying it.

1235
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,340
Thank you to people tweeting about our program using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1236
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,780
I would ask that you, if you're going to tweet about our show,

1237
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:31,540
throw in some links to our sampler.

1238
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,500
It's bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

1239
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,980
How's the second chapter of that coming out?

1240
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,620
The second one is like I'm sort of in the works.

1241
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,220
Justin's, it's been done for months.

1242
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,780
Justin's just whittling every precious millisecond off of it.

1243
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,900
He's trying to hone it down to the perfect.

1244
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,380
I just want to get it perfect and done.

1245
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,260
So that's coming along.

1246
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,980
I'm getting there.

1247
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,460
And thank you for sharing the show.

1248
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,960
Yeah.

1249
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,300
Hey, we need to get real serious for a moment.

1250
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:05,800
Okay.

1251
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,560
So there's this whole issue going around with podcasts.

1252
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,520
And there are some patent trolls that are really just being assholes.

1253
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,480
They're jerks.

1254
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,800
Yeah.

1255
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,960
Basically what it is, is they're claiming that they invented podcasts

1256
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,880
and everything that people do is illegal and infringing on their copyright.

1257
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,800
Our friends at Stuff You Should Know have been hit by it.

1258
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,080
Adam Kroll has been hit by it.

1259
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,120
It's a bunch of really shitty dudes doing this.

1260
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,200
Our only hope is right now going through Congress.

1261
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,680
It's what's called the Shield Act,

1262
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,760
which basically says that if this frivolous lawsuit comes up,

1263
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,160
if the podcast wins, if the defendant wins,

1264
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,800
the patent troll is forced to pay the legal fees.

1265
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,040
Right.

1266
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,000
It's the odds of us losing is negligible,

1267
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,600
but the legal fees would be, they would be crippling to,

1268
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,040
you know, if it hit us, it would be like pretty much the end of,

1269
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,360
like I don't think we could pay for what it would take to do it.

1270
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,680
And I think if Maximum Fun got hit, like it would be devastating.

1271
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,080
So we'd have to just start emailing you.

1272
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,760
We'd have to start mailing cassette tapes.

1273
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:18,920
Right.

1274
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,480
It would become a whole underground podcast movement.

1275
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,880
Do you know those email chains that your stepdad forwards to you

1276
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,080
and they kind of say some offensive stuff about Justice Sotomayor?

1277
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,920
And you're like, I don't know how to feel about this.

1278
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,040
That is basically what would be reduced to is email chains

1279
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,120
that we would send through your stepdad.

1280
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,200
So we're going to be posting a link for it today.

1281
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,640
We're working with the Electronic Frontier Foundation

1282
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,520
to mobilize podcast fans to contact their congresspeople about the Shield Act

1283
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,560
and tell them to, you know, pass it and help us.

1284
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,960
And it's really, it's important to us.

1285
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,880
It's important to Maximum Fun, but more than anything,

1286
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,480
it's kind of important to the podcast medium in general.

1287
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,120
So, you know, you guys are fans.

1288
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,240
Let's stop this thing together, I guess.

1289
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,160
So when we post that URL, I'm not sure you click it and do what you need to do.

1290
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,960
Yes, we can.

1291
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,800
Yes, we can.

1292
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Finally.

1293
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,000
Change.

1294
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,200
Change.

1295
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,080
Changing to believe in.

1296
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,640
So that's going to do it for us here.

1297
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,840
I'm my brother, my brother and me.

1298
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,480
Thanks to John Roderick and a lot of winners for letting us use their song.

1299
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,040
It's a departure of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1300
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,000
You can go get that on iTunes and make sure you join us again next Monday

1301
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,040
for my brother and my brother and me.

1302
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,640
Oh, if you want to email us your questions, your quandaries, your queries,

1303
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,640
you send them to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

1304
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,400
And if you want to get a birthday announcement or whatever,

1305
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,800
congratulate someone in a shout out.

1306
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,480
It's at maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1307
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,680
It's finally out.

1308
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,120
Who was sent in by Ira Ray?

1309
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,360
Are you Ira Ray?

1310
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,880
See, I just tried to sing it, like sing the first part

1311
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,840
so that we could just like get through it as fast as we could.

1312
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,560
No dice.

1313
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,120
OK.

1314
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,760
Thanks, Ira Ray.

1315
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user moremots who asks,

1316
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,280
what around the house stuff can I use to make my daughter

1317
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,640
look like Benjamin Franklin?

1318
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,640
He's Justin McElroy.

1319
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

1320
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1321
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:30,600
This has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad.
