1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, meat advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm your sweet brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,960
Welcome to McElroy Master Class. Here in McElroy Master Class,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,200
these three experts will take something that they are the masters of,

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,320
and we'll be teaching you about it. I, for example, will be teaching

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
sourdough bread making. Griffin, what will you be teaching?

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,080
I was gonna do sourdough bread making, but I guess I'll switch.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,040
I can switch mine.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
No, you said it first, and so I think it's only fair.

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,640
Can I do, wouldn't it be fucking hysterical if it was like sourdough bread eating?

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,160
That's pretty good.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Stop the podcast, I wanna get off.

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,960
I want you to be completely honest with yourself and with our listeners and with us.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,160
Are you a master at eating sourdough?

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
That's a good point.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,680
Do you know, what are some of the mastery points?

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
One is like selection is huge.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,160
Don't cut yourself on the crust.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,680
You're gonna cut yourself on the crust.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
So I think it's mostly a sort of biological,

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,400
bioorganic sort of toughening of the gums,

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,160
whether that is through snus and snuff,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,920
or whether that is through a sort of DNA alteration,

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,600
radiation, pills, surgery, gums surgery,

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,800
to make it tough getting turtle shell put on there.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
What about pairing? What about pairings? Knowing the exact pairings.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,920
What does this sourdough bread go with? What kind of moment?

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Which ones are aphrodisiacs?

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,640
That's a fucking trap, Justin, because a true sourdough master,

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,640
the only thing that pairs well with sourdough is even more sourdough, baby.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,360
That is true.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,160
Now, Justin, I assume that for this masterclass, you will be teaching carpentry.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
No, I'll do something else. I'll come up with something.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Hold on, let me think about it.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
My wallet's pretty organized.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,080
It's slim as hell.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,520
I just got the essentials in there.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I got scans of things that I don't need to swipe.

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,680
I have no cash because I'm unmuggable.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Wait, you have scans of things you don't need to swipe?

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
Like my SAG card, right?

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm not going to carry that around with me.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't need to prove that I have SAG credits at any moment in my life,

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
but I do need the number to be able to pay my dues.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,080
So I scan that. Don't carry it around with me on my wallet.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
Oh, I thought you meant like a photocopy of it in your wallet,

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
and I didn't see how that was better.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,120
I mean, that's actually not a bad tip.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
If you don't need to swipe it, but you do want it all you at all times,

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
get something thinner.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Some sort of translucent parchment perhaps.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,040
We're deep. We're knuckle deep inquire right now.

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
And so like, I have not needed my wallet in a long, long time.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
I put on socks and shoes yesterday to do some yard work.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
And your feet screamed in pain.

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,960
I realized I had not worn socks in literally three months.

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,840
And so that was a challenge for me.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,520
Justin, I know you've been doing some great wood projects

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,320
and you did suggest to us literally before we record

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
that you didn't want to talk about it.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, I just said I didn't.

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,760
I said before we, I was telling you guys about the bench I just finished.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,240
And then I said, I didn't want to talk about it on the book.

70
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,720
And you said you wanted it to be private.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,160
And I wanted to say, but son of a bench, that's good.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
And you took that from Travis.

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
And I'm curious why you're ashamed of this incredible bench.

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,240
It's not that I'm ashamed.

75
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,320
I just want something for me.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
And I think that should be okay.

77
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,840
I don't have to share every aspect of my life with the people.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
I can have a little something for me.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
I don't want to talk about woodwork.

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Like I don't want to, first, I've just begun learning the craft.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,840
So I don't want to be treated like some sort of expert in it

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
and say something silly.

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,000
But also, if I talk about anything on earth enough,

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll accidentally start a podcast about it.

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,200
That's true.

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
I don't want to do that.

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Maybe you should start another masterclass, Justin, about baking.

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,760
Because I think you're serving up a big tasty slice of humble pie right now.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,120
My friend, look at this bench.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
This is the bench.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
This is the bench of a master carpenter.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
This is the kind of bench that Christ would make.

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,760
It's just a simple-

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
Griffin, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Nowhere in the Bible to say that Jesus was a master carpenter.

96
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
He might have been very bad at it.

97
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
He may have been just okay, but he-

98
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,640
If he was that great at it, he probably would have stuck with it.

99
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,560
That's what I was saying.

100
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
Anyway, Justin, what is your class going to be?

101
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Because it can't be the thing you said about the wallet,

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
because that's not anything.

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,160
I guess I eat a lot of beans still.

104
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,480
Kind of different bean preps.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,960
Dang it.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
We did establish a super precedent that we can just talk about eating stuff good.

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,840
Shit.

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
Can I go back to that?

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
Because I can eat a lot of M&Ms in one sitting.

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
No, Travis, you've already done-

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Bean cookery, listen to this.

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
I got lesson one, okay?

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
You're booting it up.

114
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,720
Hello, I'm sitting behind the table.

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Hold on, booting it up?

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Is it on fucking floppy disk?

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,320
Yeah, you have to preload all of them into your Commodore 64 and then run them.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,200
Hi, it's me, Justin McElroy.

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
If you get a cup of red lentils

120
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,520
and then soak them in two cups of water overnight with some salt

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
and then blend them in a blender and make a dough,

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,040
and then you can make a tortilla out of red lentils,

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,560
that's all lentil tortillas.

124
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,760
It's delicious.

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,480
Should you, though?

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
Is it better that way?

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,240
You never stop to ask, should I do this?

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,040
I mean, it's better than a lot of different ways you can eat lentils.

129
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,520
Sure.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,080
That's fair.

131
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,200
Okay, sure.

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,640
There's many more unpleasant ways to eat lentils.

133
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Here is a brief summation of those.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeah.

135
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,640
Candied, like sunflowers, just raw.

136
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
Chewing your teeth down to nubs.

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,320
Juice.

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
Trying to enjoy raw cauliflower.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,040
J-Dog.

140
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Raw lentils, yes.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,480
You do, you did twice there, say, eat sunflowers.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
Are you talking about the seeds

143
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,200
or have you just been just sort of walking up to these bastards in the field

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,240
and just opening your mouth and running into them?

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I wouldn't know the plant that makes lentils if it was my uncle.

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
I would not be able to identify this plant.

147
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
I know they come in a bag.

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,280
And fun fact about lentils.

149
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
Ooh, the one?

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Here's like a bonus.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,440
If you click down at the bottom, there's a hidden pixel.

152
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
And if you click on it, you get a bonus lesson.

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,200
If you read and you don't wash lentils,

154
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,680
apparently, in every bag of lentils, there's usually like a couple of pebbles.

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
Just to keep it fucking fresh and fun.

156
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
There's usually just like a couple of small pebbles.

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
And people say like, now make sure you wash these thoroughly

158
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
because there's probably some fucking pebbles in there.

159
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,360
As though that is a standard for any other food that we consume that is acceptable.

160
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,640
It's like lentils DRM that they put in there

161
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,280
to make sure you legally purchased these lentils.

162
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,480
How about just don't do that?

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,920
How about just get them out?

164
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
What do you want, Justin?

165
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,280
Someone to go through your lentils before they're in the bag and get the pebbles out?

166
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
Then what would you do?

167
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
One thing that's part of your responsibility with these lentils

168
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
is to make sure you get all the pebbles out of it.

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
It doesn't make any sense.

170
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,680
I don't want to.

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Those are the prize.

172
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Like a little toy in the cereal.

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
No, I know that doesn't track.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
It doesn't work like that.

175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Should we do questions?

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes, I would love that.

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,320
I have a fun new game.

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,960
Oh, good.

179
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh, this is good.

180
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Is it good?

181
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh, it's good.

182
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,560
You'll like this.

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,400
This is actually, the idea was given to me by Moment of Magic Pod,

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,560
which you should check out.

185
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you mean you stole it from them?

186
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,520
No, they tweeted it at me.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,800
Okay.

188
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
I thought it was a great idea.

189
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,960
Okay.

190
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
And so I got a couple different things here first.

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
And I think Griffin, you might get this.

192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,040
That's a hint.

193
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Wait, is this another fucking quiz show?

194
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,960
Because you can't just say it's a different game

195
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
if it's play along at home.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,960
No, this is a different game.

197
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,600
This is not-

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay, so this is a quiz show where if you're listening at home

199
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
and you try to fucking answer this,

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,120
you have to delete the podcast

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
because you're not allowed to play at home.

202
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
I mean, listen, there are questions.

203
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Then this is play along at home.

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
What's the difference between this and play along at home?

205
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Hey, Griffin, can I talk to you over here for a second?

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah, sure.

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
How come every time I bring a game,

208
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
you just assume it's going to be bad?

209
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
Good question.

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
That's the first question of the quiz.

211
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
Okay, listen.

212
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm not saying that because you don't even know.

213
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,680
Hey, Griffin, we're still over here.

214
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,400
You haven't even heard what the quiz is based on yet.

215
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Okay, but it's a fucking...

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
If Alec Trebek showed up to the set of Jeopardy

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
and was like, what up, everybody?

218
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
I got a bunch of cool questions for you all

219
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
in my new game, Quisms,

220
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
and you feel like, what?

221
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Yeah, this game's called Quisms.

222
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm going to ask you answers

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
and you have to give me the forms of the questions.

224
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,320
And people will be like, bud, that's Jeopardy.

225
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
You can't just say this is a different,

226
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
welcome to my new game, Wheel of Letters.

227
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Do you mean Wheel of Fortune?

228
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
It's similar in a lot of ways.

229
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
Hey, Griffin?

230
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
Yeah, fucking, okay, go.

231
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
You haven't even heard what it's about.

232
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay, let's hear it.

233
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,040
We're going to talk about Cameo, the service Cameo.

234
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Okay.

235
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Now, let me start off the bat right here.

236
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
If you don't know what it is, Cameo is a really fun service.

237
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
This is not a paid advertisement.

238
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
It's very fun where you go

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
and you pay celebrities different amounts of money

240
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,400
to say a birthday wish or something like that.

241
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,960
Happy anniversary message, something like that.

242
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,760
You can get Richard Karn to flip off your principle.

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Right.

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,400
I tried to get Richard Karn to do a message

245
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,160
for our 500th episode.

246
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
He said, and I just got a message back

247
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
and I was like, sorry, don't do paid ads.

248
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
Smiley face emoji.

249
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
And I was like, that sucks.

250
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,240
But I did also just get a free email from Richard Karn.

251
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,480
Nice.

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
Fucking cool.

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
I will be talking about Richard Karn in this segment.

254
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, fantastic, fantastic.

255
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
He seems nice as hell, by the way.

256
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah, we have a lot of friends on Cameo,

257
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,360
including Matt Doyle to go buy a Cameo for Matt Doyle,

258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
support some actors and performers

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
during these off work times.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
So, Lance Bass is on there.

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
Sure.

262
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm going to read his bio

263
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,960
and you're going to try to guess the amount

264
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
to get Cameo from Lance Bass.

265
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,640
Okay, this is a good game.

266
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
I've turned around on it.

267
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,520
Okay, now let's start here.

268
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,880
Kudos to Lance Bass.

269
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,160
Proceed from Lance's cameos are donated to charity.

270
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,120
Cool.

271
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Now this is his bio.

272
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,240
Insinker, host of At The Daily Popcast,

273
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
foodie, filmmaker, OG Sephiroth.

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Whoa, hold on, what?

275
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
The original Sephiroth was Lance Bass?

276
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah, dude.

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
I had to look that up.

278
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,280
He did the voice of Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts.

279
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, okay.

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
Well, okay, I mean, that's fucking wild.

281
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,040
Not quite as wild as him being, you know,

282
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
fucking one-winged angel destroyer of worlds.

283
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,400
I guess it makes more sense that he did a voice of him.

284
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,720
And it does make it seem like he originated the concept.

285
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I was Sephiroth and they based it off me.

286
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,080
Beloved torso stabber, Sephiroth, me.

287
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,200
Frosted tips survivor, an animal rescuer, Lance Bass.

288
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
Can I say something?

289
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm gonna say something about Lance Bass

290
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
before we move on to Lance Bass.

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,480
Lance Bass in 2002 wanted to join a Russian mission

292
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
to the ISS, to the International Space Station,

293
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
and became certified by both NASA

294
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
and the Russian space program

295
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,680
after several months of cosmonaut training.

296
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,160
Cool.

297
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
Do you want to know the rest of that that I really enjoy?

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,520
What's that?

299
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
He, at the last minute, was not able to go,

300
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,840
but they calibrated everything for his weight.

301
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
So they had to put a barrel full of stuff

302
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,440
equal to Lance Bass' weight in the shuttle.

303
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
What, what, holy shit.

304
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
How much, what?

305
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,280
Okay, fuck this.

306
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,640
I don't care about how much it takes to,

307
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
how much it costs to get a cameo from him.

308
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
I want to know how much it costs to get the Lance Bass barrel

309
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
that I can just kind of put in my living room.

310
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
That is the, oh, what's with that fucking barrel?

311
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,400
It has nothing to do with anything else in the room.

312
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,280
Well, let me tell you.

313
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,360
Do you want to know how much Lance Bass weighs?

314
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
The barrel.

315
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,200
He lays a barrel with his face.

316
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Can I keep talking about Lance Bass, please?

317
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,920
Yeah.

318
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay, during his cosmonaut training,

319
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
he had to get a thorough physical

320
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,000
and it was discovered that he had a cardiac arrhythmia

321
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
that he had to undergo surgery for

322
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
and it saved his life.

323
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,080
His desire to be, he would not have become discovered

324
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,480
had he not gone into cosmonaut training.

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Absolutely baffling.

326
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
My man, Lance Bass, by the way,

327
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
if I could just keep talking about Lance Bass for a second,

328
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,720
has retained fucking fluent Russian

329
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
that he learned as part of his cosmonaut training.

330
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,200
Are you kidding me?

331
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,160
50 dollars.

332
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Early, early cosmonaut training saves lives.

333
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,160
This is what I'm saying.

334
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
Yes, yes, absolutely.

335
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,200
What an absolute, this guy rules.

336
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,240
Kicks ass.

337
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
But how much money to get him to flip off your principal?

338
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,400
Whatever it is, it's too low.

339
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm going to say 200 dollars.

340
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
I don't even know if it goes up that high for cameo,

341
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,400
but I'm gonna say 200 dollars.

342
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,940
Justin?

343
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
For Lance Bass, I'm gonna say,

344
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,680
I feel like Griffin's in the neighborhood,

345
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
but I'm gonna go with 250 actually.

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
It is 250 on the dot.

347
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,960
And worth every penny.

348
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,640
Worth every penny.

349
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
Wait, did you say I got it right?

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,520
Or did you say 250?

351
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,240
It was 250?

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah, you got it.

353
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay.

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,040
That money.

355
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,540
Oh.

356
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,400
Have a combo.

357
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,080
Yeah, I haven't used that one in a while.

358
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Okay, now, next.

359
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
Mark McGrath.

360
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
Oh, man.

361
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Now, he had a fun cameo

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
where he broke up with somebody

363
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,240
but wished them well on their finals,

364
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,480
on their doctorate, I believe.

365
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,980
Wait.

366
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
He broke up with someone's,

367
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,280
a young lady, I believe,

368
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,040
entreated him to dump her boyfriend on cameo

369
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,200
and Mark McGrath obliged.

370
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
While kind of throwing shade at her

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
because he's in the middle of a very tense time in his life.

372
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
But Mark McGrath recorded a very lovely message to this person

373
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,640
and then dumped them.

374
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Now, that might explain,

375
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,800
I've pulled two reviews here from Mark's cameos.

376
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
And this first one is,

377
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,960
unreal how thoughtful and personal this is.

378
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,560
Thank you so much, brother.

379
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
I got a little teary eyed watching this.

380
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Not gonna lie, you're the real one.

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,400
He's the real one.

382
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
You're the real one.

383
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,480
Now, that probably is some kind of fun turn of phrase

384
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
but it could also be like,

385
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
you're not an impersonator.

386
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,640
You are the real Mark McGrath.

387
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,320
This is the Mark McGrath you crave.

388
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Do you remember when Mark McGrath went ballistic on a child

389
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,840
because during a paparazzi photo sesh,

390
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,920
the child yelled sugar gay at him.

391
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
I think about it all the time.

392
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,160
He went fucking ballistic and went to fight the child,

393
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,960
which is bad.

394
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
It's so bad on every level.

395
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,600
But I guess my question is,

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,520
did he charge him for the cameo-

397
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
In his life story.

398
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,880
In his life story of being the kid

399
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,680
that Mark McGrath said he was gonna beat his ass up

400
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
because he said sugar gay.

401
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
And second quick review here.

402
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
My sister Shelly and her family totally loved this video.

403
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,960
Mark went above and beyond with a fantastic performance

404
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
and an epic Elvis ending.

405
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Mark also pronounces Hawaiian like a local.

406
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,280
So cool.

407
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Cool beans, man.

408
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah, I figured the lead singer Sugar Ray's done his time

409
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
in the islands.

410
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,120
No question.

411
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,280
And what is an Elvis ending?

412
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Got me.

413
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,200
Don't know.

414
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,080
Didn't do the research.

415
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,800
Didn't find out.

416
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,960
No, ate a cool sandwich, I bet.

417
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
Justin, you wanna do the honors first

418
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,200
and see one last round?

419
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah, you know what?

420
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
I'm gonna go for Mark McGrath.

421
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
I think you're gonna pay.

422
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,120
It's a premium.

423
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,440
I feel like his star is just a little bit higher

424
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,240
than Lance Bass, weirdly.

425
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
Cause he's got like a show on Sirius every weekend

426
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and he's staying busy, staying in the news.

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
I bet he jacked up his rates after he went a little viral

428
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
with the breakup.

429
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm gonna set him right at $300.

430
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,240
Okay, Griffin.

431
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
That is fucking poppycock.

432
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Griffin, you're pretty far away from the microphone.

433
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,480
I know, it's because I was leaning back because

434
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
of the fucking ridiculousness of Justin's offer.

435
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,240
He doesn't even have cosmonaut training.

436
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
I'm gonna say, if it's anything more than $100,

437
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
I will eat my shoes.

438
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
It is $99.

439
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
I'm giving that to Griffin.

440
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,880
Wow, Griffin, amazing.

441
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,280
Thank you.

442
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
Very close, I'm very impressed.

443
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,680
We're all tied up, one and one.

444
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,960
Now, for this last, this is a head-to-head competition,

445
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,760
this last one.

446
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,240
Okay.

447
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
And this is direct from, once again, I'm gonna give credit

448
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
to you at Magic Moment Pod.

449
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200
Here it is, are you ready?

450
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes.

451
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,240
Richard Karn and Tom Arnold are both on Cameo.

452
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm calling this category Karn-old.

453
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,360
Wish you wouldn't.

454
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
I want you guys to give me who charges more,

455
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Richard Karn or Tom Arnold,

456
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,760
and for the deciding factor, if you can get closest

457
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
to the price of your choice, you will win.

458
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,040
Wow.

459
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
Now, let me also say what I really enjoy,

460
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
because we were on Young Father's Day,

461
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,920
both of these actors, Richard Karn and Tom Arnold,

462
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,760
had the hashtag, a gift for all dads.

463
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
A gift for every dad.

464
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,240
A gift for all dads.

465
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
What dad wouldn't be excited to receive a Cameo

466
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
from either of these actors?

467
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
A gift for all dads.

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean, I'd be excited for one of them,

469
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,560
but if I got the other one, I'd be fucking pissed

470
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
and they know which one it is.

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,040
Oh boy.

472
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,080
And that's all I'm gonna fucking say.

473
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
A gift for all dads.

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,040
A gift for all dads.

475
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
Tom Arnold is worth more money than Richard Karn,

476
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,680
in general, so I'm gonna give-

477
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
He doesn't know that?

478
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah.

479
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,200
I mean, I have a whole rubric that I use to judge famous people

480
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
for how much money that they're worth,

481
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,040
and I think Tom Arnold just comes out on top of Richard Karn.

482
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,640
Rich, boy, but you know I'm there for you,

483
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
but Tom Arnold's got you beat in that category.

484
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
I mean, I feel like I'm gonna have to go to Tom Arnold as well.

485
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,360
Yes.

486
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
Which is not fair.

487
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,760
What's the deciding thing?

488
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
How much Tom Arnold?

489
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,880
Yeah, how much for Tom Arnold?

490
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,200
How much to get a Tom Arnold?

491
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah.

492
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,760
I feel like Tom Arnold is gonna cost you.

493
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,120
Again, I feel like Tom Arnold is gonna run you $225.

494
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
And I feel like Richard Karn is $75.

495
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,040
No, you know what?

496
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,480
Richard Karn's $75, Tom Arnold, $150.

497
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,280
That is it.

498
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm gonna say twice as much.

499
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,880
It's Richard Karn who I bet costs $75.

500
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,080
I know I entreated him to record a greeting for our show.

501
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
I do not remember the cost.

502
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
I didn't pay that close attention to it.

503
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
And folks, that's privilege.

504
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm gonna go ahead and just say it.

505
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll do anything for the show.

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,640
Now, Griffin.

507
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Yeah.

508
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
Yeah, I was gonna say $150 also for Tom Arnold,

509
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
but Justin's swooped in there.

510
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
How much for Richard Karn?

511
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
How much for Richard Karn?

512
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah.

513
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,120
You said $75 for Richard Karn, $150 for Tom Arnold?

514
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,240
That is what I said.

515
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
God, that's so fucking good, Juice.

516
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
It feels right, doesn't it?

517
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,120
It's got a very good mouthfeel.

518
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
I'm gonna say $76.

519
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,560
$75 for Richard Karn.

520
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,720
$76 for Richard Karn, $149 for Tom Arnold.

521
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm gonna call it a tie,

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
because none of that cheap bullshit, Griffin.

523
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,600
You can't fucking...

524
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
Okay, that's fucking bullshit.

525
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
You can't just make up the rules of this incredible game

526
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,960
as we go along.

527
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,640
$76 for Richard Karn, $149 for Tom Arnold.

528
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,280
Okay, then shit.

529
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,640
I gotta give it to Griffin.

530
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Richard Karn, $80.

531
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,000
Tom Arnold, $125.

532
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
A gift for all dads.

533
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,880
A gift for all dads.

534
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,640
Hey, for $200.

535
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
It's a combo.

536
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,240
Get them talking to each other.

537
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
Might can fucking read a scene from Waiting for Godot together.

538
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,000
You get that Carnold accent.

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
Might, your dad's gonna love this recreation of True West,

540
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,320
starring Richard Karn and Tom Arnold

541
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,800
alternating roles in each caveat.

542
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,300
All right.

543
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,840
That was a good game, Travis.

544
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,640
You've done it.

545
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
You've fucking cracked the code.

546
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
I mean, it wasn't your idea,

547
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,760
but you fucking executed it beautifully.

548
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
Thank you very much.

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
All I wanna talk about anymore is Lance Bass.

550
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
Lance, if you're listening, bud, please.

551
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,280
Hit us up.

552
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,640
Reach out to, you know, we have a very good track record.

553
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
Lance, if you would love to come on the show

554
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
and just talk, to be a guest, I would love to have you.

555
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,360
It's fun.

556
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
I will go on rather to saying,

557
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
I think any NSYNC member,

558
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,920
except Justin Timberlake.

559
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,480
Yeah.

560
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,840
I don't want, we've made it clear,

561
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,880
we don't want JT on the show,

562
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
but I would love to have Lance on here.

563
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
If we could get J.C. Chazee,

564
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
oh boy, that would be a life goal.

565
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm really, can we just stay focused

566
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
for fucking once in our careers?

567
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
I just want Lance Bass as a guest spurt.

568
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,840
Okay.

569
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
I think that would be fantastic.

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
All right, let's visualize it.

571
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,560
Wait, we could combo it together,

572
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,080
chain it together, go Chris Fitzpatrick,

573
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,040
then J.C. Chazee, then Joey Fatone,

574
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,320
to Lance Bass.

575
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,560
Listen, $1,000 will get us four cameos from Lance,

576
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
and I think that might be enough

577
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
for us to put together a guest spurt segment.

578
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
We could just get him saying things

579
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,800
in response to potential questions

580
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,480
and then kind of weave them together.

581
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
Edit it together.

582
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,680
Oh, that's not bad.

583
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,880
Listen, everyone, stop.

584
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,120
Stop, it's time.

585
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,680
Oh, wait, speaking of tweeting at people,

586
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,320
I want to thank everyone for tweeting

587
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
at WSAZ's Rob Johnson.

588
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
There was a lot of tweets to Rob Johnson

589
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
for getting our kite out of the tree.

590
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
A lot of people tweeted at him to thank him.

591
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Also, I'm just gonna share this very briefly.

592
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,840
Rob Johnson said that we need to hear real music.

593
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,720
Forget Rob Thomas, you need Rob Johnson,

594
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,960
and shared a link to a brief song about Rob Johnson

595
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,800
that I'd love to share with you guys if that's okay.

596
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, boy.

597
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
It's just a very brief song about Rob Johnson.

598
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,280
Sure, and then I promise we're gonna start doing questions.

599
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
It's gonna be great.

600
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
Then the show will begin.

601
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Oh, yes.

602
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,800
This is by Rob Coleman.

603
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
It's a song about Rob Johnson,

604
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
commissioned by Alan Brown,

605
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,920
and this is how the song goes.

606
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,320
What up, my name is Rob Johnson.

607
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
My Huntington fame is Rob Johnson.

608
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Yeah, this whole show should be called Rob Johnson.

609
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
So say it out loud.

610
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,600
Stuck in the rain, Rob Johnson.

611
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
WSA, Rob Johnson.

612
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,160
See, it's where I'm gonna be, Rob Johnson.

613
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
In the Hall of Fame, Rob Johnson.

614
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
Six in the morning, what up, it's Rob Johnson.

615
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,360
And now it's midday, Rob Johnson.

616
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,760
Saying hey, Rob Johnson.

617
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,720
Indiana University, Rob Johnson.

618
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah, that's where I win one of it, Rob Johnson.

619
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,560
Just say what you want, but I love it, Rob Johnson.

620
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,960
Don't act like you are above it, Rob Johnson.

621
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
No one is ever above, Rob Johnson.

622
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,640
So that's one of my favorite songs about Rob Johnson.

623
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,760
Strong ones that I've heard.

624
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
That has no business being that good.

625
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
I know, it's way better than I expected it to be

626
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,360
when I clicked the link.

627
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Thank you, WSAZ Rob Johnson.

628
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,600
Appreciate it.

629
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,560
Hope you can figure out

630
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
why you were having some signal trouble on June 4th.

631
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,440
Best of luck to you and yours.

632
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,760
My wife and I recently moved into our first house

633
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
and it's pretty great,

634
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,000
but our elderly next door neighbor keeps mowing our yard.

635
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,040
It started with him just doing our small front yard,

636
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,680
which makes sense.

637
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,920
Since it would almost be more work

638
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,600
to mine the borders of our yards.

639
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,560
But recently he's been mowing our backyard as well

640
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,000
and he's not doing a good job.

641
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,080
He cuts corners and skips patches

642
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,200
that would be tricky for his writing mode to get into.

643
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
And worse yet, my wife and I are working from home

644
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
so we have no choice but to watch him

645
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,320
do the whole thing poorly.

646
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
Should we ask him to stop or thank him?

647
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,560
That's from Indecisive in Indiana.

648
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,720
I did not expect the twist of someone

649
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,680
who will go through the effort of mowing your backyard

650
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
but does not take pride in a job well done.

651
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,200
I did not see that coming.

652
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
I don't understand the...

653
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,040
Can you not go out there and fucking polish it off?

654
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
Somebody is mowing your lawn for free

655
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,120
and your complaint is that they're cutting corners

656
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
when you could just go out there

657
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,360
and knock out those last few corners.

658
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
Okay, here's the problem, Griffin.

659
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
What is the problem?

660
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,360
There is a factor here.

661
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
There is an unknown quantity here,

662
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,240
which is does neighbor guy think he's doing them

663
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
a good job service, right?

664
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,360
Because if he's like,

665
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,320
ah, what a good nice thing to do for my neighbors

666
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,680
and then they see you out there cleaning up after them,

667
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,240
that, oh, ow.

668
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,560
Oh, okay, okay, I see what Travis is saying.

669
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,280
Now it's like, oh, it wasn't good enough for you, huh?

670
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
I see you out there kind of going over some of my work.

671
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,720
Right, right.

672
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,280
Okay, all right, that's trickier, fair.

673
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,960
But there is also the potential

674
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,800
that this is a passive aggressive thing.

675
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
I have neighbors, they're very nice, let me be clear.

676
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
But I'm saying I could see where

677
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
if I let my lawn go a little bit,

678
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
maybe didn't have it mowed,

679
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,440
then they're like, oh, I see that Travis hasn't mowed his lawn.

680
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,600
What a sloppy young man, this millennial.

681
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
Probably too busy out there partying

682
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,360
and raving and eating avocado toast.

683
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
Sorry, did you say avocado?

684
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah, they're old, they don't know what an avocado is.

685
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,240
They say avocado.

686
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
This generational gap just keeps getting worse.

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,160
Yeah, and so then they come over

688
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,200
and they mow my lawn and it's a passive aggressive thing.

689
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Right, yeah, you're gonna have to do it at night

690
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,640
with one of those push mowers that doesn't make sounds.

691
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
Yeah, stealth mower.

692
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
A stealth mowing situation.

693
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,760
Or scissors, scissors are nice and quiet.

694
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
Or just rip the shit up so it doesn't grow back.

695
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Why don't people do that?

696
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,520
Yeah, put down some turf.

697
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,920
Put down a little bit of astroturf down there.

698
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,040
And then also if you want to throw the pigskin around,

699
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,960
it's right there ready for you.

700
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
A bunch of like black plastic, make it into a slip and slide.

701
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Hole, put some visqueen down,

702
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,560
make a whole backyard slip and slide.

703
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Nobody's done that before.

704
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
Dig a pond.

705
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
No one thinks about, and this is like,

706
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
think about it for a second, dig a pond back there.

707
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,120
All you need for a pond is the absence of dirt and water.

708
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
That's right, and the water's gonna come from rain.

709
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,680
Yeah, and now you got a swimming hole.

710
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,720
And then you got a big old swimming hole in the backyard.

711
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,520
And that's fun because then all the neighborhood youth can come

712
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,680
and everyone and neighbors and instead of getting into drugs

713
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,480
and, you know, hard partying or whatever,

714
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
everybody can just come down to the swimming hole,

715
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,920
talk about life, a lot about living and a little about love.

716
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,400
You may be overthinking this.

717
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,840
You may be overthinking this a little bit

718
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,400
because if I owned a beautiful, powerful John Deere riding mower,

719
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm assuming it's a deer because if it's not, it's not a machine,

720
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,720
is that if I got done mowing my lawn

721
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,840
on my beautiful John Deere riding mower,

722
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,680
I imagine my first thought would be like,

723
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,720
ooh, I would love to cut a little bit more lawn

724
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,480
with this huge, beautiful machine.

725
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,200
I don't think anybody gets done mowing their lawn

726
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,800
in their riding mower and thinks like, that has satisfied me.

727
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,080
I think they probably think like,

728
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,680
oof, oh man, I'm hungry for even more.

729
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
So they may just be trying to like,

730
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
either satisfy this dark passenger,

731
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,680
like trying to like make their purchase of a riding mower

732
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
make a little bit more sense.

733
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
That's what it is, yes.

734
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
I like that, I like that.

735
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,160
But I do like Griffin that in your mind,

736
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,040
this person is like, well, I already bought the mower

737
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
and my yard is only like 20 square feet,

738
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
so I need to keep using this somewhere,

739
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,240
but I am not invested in the quality of my job

740
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,160
because it's not my yard.

741
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,480
Yeah, you could set up some traffic cones

742
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
that he could like slalom around,

743
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
but like position them in a way

744
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
that he would make sure that he would get

745
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
all those nooks and crannies.

746
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,720
And then he would have more fun with it too.

747
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
That would be better for everybody.

748
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,240
Yeah. And you get to watch it.

749
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,560
Yeah, you could also get your own riding lawn mower

750
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,160
and then every time he goes out, be like,

751
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
oh shit, he's going, quick, go!

752
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
And then you get on your own riding lawn mower

753
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
and do your own yard, and you can do like a race with it.

754
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,840
There's lots of cool ways to get to know your neighbor.

755
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
Get in, get a lance.

756
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Get a lance.

757
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,280
Yeah, get a lance bass.

758
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,880
No, get a jousting lance bass.

759
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,200
I said, I meant like jousting lance,

760
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
that would be fun in riding lawn mowers,

761
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
but I think there's something also great

762
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
to getting a lance bass to do a cameo

763
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,200
to ask your neighbor to stop fucking up your grass.

764
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
Hey, Z Lance says, I'm going to say this in Russian,

765
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,720
please stop fucking up my grass.

766
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
Hey, even from space,

767
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,920
I can see you're doing a terrible job mowing the grass.

768
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,320
I brought this barrel full of stuff

769
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,160
that's going to hold down the grass

770
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,920
so it won't grow up anymore.

771
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,640
I found your lack of work ethic heartbreaking

772
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
and I can't handle that.

773
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
I've had enough problems.

774
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,480
I need you to just stay in your home, please, citizen.

775
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
Let me mow the lawn for you.

776
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
This is my side business.

777
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,480
I bought a lawn mower and I've been making some extra scratch.

778
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm going to build my own rocket.

779
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
Griffin, do you have any yahoos saved up this week

780
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
that you'd like to share with us?

781
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
I'd love that if you do.

782
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
I could do a quick one, yeah, sure.

783
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
This yahoo is sent in by lots of folks, thanks.

784
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,520
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

785
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,280
who I'm going to name Jim, wow, asks.

786
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,000
But it's not spelled how it sounds.

787
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No, no, it's G-Y-M, asks,

788
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
why don't we have castles anymore?

789
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
We only have regular basic buildings now.

790
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,000
Why did humans stop building castles?

791
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,320
Castles are just as good and sturdy as regular buildings,

792
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
except they look better.

793
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,680
So why did humans stop building castles?

794
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,040
I live in America, BTW,

795
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,120
and maybe it's just America that hates castles.

796
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
I haven't been to other countries.

797
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,520
There's castles, I mean, I'm talking out of my ass now,

798
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,120
but I would estimate that the castle per square inch ratio

799
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,240
of America is lower than a lot of other sort of territories

800
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
across this beautiful globe of ours.

801
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,840
I think I can understand the question

802
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,640
because castles are made out of what?

803
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
Rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

804
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,000
That's basically it from what I like.

805
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,520
And tapestries.

806
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,280
Tapestries, but I don't even think

807
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,520
they have load-bearing tapestries in castles.

808
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,680
I think, you know, brass tacks,

809
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880
there are no brass tacks involved.

810
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,800
It's just rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

811
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,360
That's every, I've never walked around inside a castle

812
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
and been like, hmm, drywall.

813
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,040
It's always rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

814
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,120
And there's lots of fucking rocks.

815
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,080
And I imagine lots of ways to get them to stick together.

816
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
And so like, I don't understand why, you know,

817
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,480
the housing crisis.

818
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't think people stopped building castles

819
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,440
because they ran out of materials, Griffin.

820
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
I don't think anyone thought that was it.

821
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Well, no, it was just like somebody invented drywall

822
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,320
and they're like, oh cool,

823
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
this is what it has to be from now on.

824
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
But like, I guess drywall and wood and stuff is expensive.

825
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
But like, there's a shortage of housing,

826
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,200
available housing as a commodity.

827
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
And I think that we could just start

828
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,760
slapping some rocks together

829
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
and making some pretty fucking cool houses out of it.

830
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
And it's not just like, so we could have houses.

831
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,880
We could have fucking cool castle houses in it too,

832
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,440
like in Link Check.

833
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Why do we need, I mean, we don't need,

834
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
why do we need a castle is my thing.

835
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,840
Like, if I upset my neighbors,

836
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't expect them to try to settle it

837
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,360
with siege weaponry.

838
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,840
Oh, you don't?

839
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,040
I don't expect them to come out with like,

840
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,720
catapults and I was about to say Battista.

841
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
What's up, it's me, Dave Battista.

842
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm gonna start kicking your castle.

843
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,560
We're gonna see what happens.

844
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Your neighbor paid for a cameo.

845
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
It's my new service, Kickio.

846
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,800
I go to your house and kick your castle

847
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,560
until it falls down, Dave Battista.

848
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,760
Yeah, I know, Groot.

849
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,400
What of it?

850
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,040
Kick, kick, kick, kick.

851
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:40,560
It's just no need for the castle.

852
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,320
There's no need for, you know,

853
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,600
castles were used, a lot of the ruling class

854
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,720
would make them like the boss of the fiefdom, right?

855
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
They would leave in a castle and then rule over.

856
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,280
If my neighbors saw me building a castle,

857
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,200
they would probably start to get suspicious.

858
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
What is this guy gonna do?

859
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
Does this guy have designs on trying to rule over

860
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,280
the region, the new King of Huntington brand?

861
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,240
Every time I have learned anything about a castle,

862
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,520
basically what I've learned is that the timeline breaks down

863
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,640
as castle building is completed

864
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,960
and then like the next day somebody comes

865
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,640
and by some means will leave out,

866
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,080
clears everyone out of that castle

867
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,760
and now that castle is theirs,

868
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,120
repeat for about 500 years.

869
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,560
So haunted.

870
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,760
That would not fly now.

871
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,920
It wouldn't be like you left your house

872
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,200
and then I got in it.

873
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,360
Well, I guess that's your squatter's rights, isn't it?

874
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,040
There's a lot of complicated issues there,

875
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,720
but I think the point remains that like

876
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,640
if you walked into a house and someone told you,

877
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,600
pretty cool house, huh?

878
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,680
Hundreds and hundreds of people have been killed here

879
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,720
to get the house.

880
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,520
Then I would be like,

881
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,520
I don't wanna be in this house anymore.

882
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,360
And yet you walk into a castle or a fortress

883
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,520
and it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool place.

884
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
Like look at all the rocks.

885
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
Pillars, love it.

886
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
Look at those sconces.

887
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Those are original sconces.

888
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
Thousands dead in mini sieges.

889
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,680
Then I would be like,

890
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,360
the ghost, the spectral energy in here is not great.

891
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,920
So I'm gonna-

892
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
That is true.

893
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,560
When I was buying a house,

894
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,920
like our realtor wasn't like,

895
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
and you see that, that tiny hole near the floor?

896
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,400
Do you know what that's for?

897
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,680
Hot oil.

898
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,440
That's hot oil.

899
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
In case somebody tries.

900
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
So that's gonna keep them away.

901
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,160
And that hole over there,

902
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,320
that's for shooting arrows out of.

903
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,680
So that's pretty cool, huh?

904
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
I rescind the question.

905
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a bad question and I think about it.

906
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,280
Do you think that there was somebody

907
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
who built a castle,

908
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,520
like after the Age of Castles was done?

909
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
And like, as they built the castle,

910
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,040
they finished and they're like,

911
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
Todd, no one wants to take this.

912
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,640
And they're like,

913
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,160
oh man, doesn't somebody wanna take my castle?

914
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,920
It's like, no, these things are highly important.

915
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,040
How do you keep this high in the winter

916
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
and cold in the summertime?

917
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,240
This is highly impractical.

918
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,040
You need to be in a temperate region for sure.

919
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,360
Do you think the person exists, Travis,

920
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,520
who would spend a bunch of money

921
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,840
building a modern day castle,

922
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,120
who would at any point thereafter

923
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,880
would admit that it was a mistake?

924
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,240
Like fellow cosmonaut Richard Garriott,

925
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
creator of the Ultima series,

926
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,600
built a castle here in Austin, Texas

927
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,840
that has all kinds of incredible winding corridors

928
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,880
and secret passages

929
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200
and did a fucking museum with a Tesla coil

930
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,200
and a bunch of old archaic technology in it.

931
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
But you know he probably gets to a point

932
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,080
where he wakes up in the middle of the night

933
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,760
and he does have diarrhea

934
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
and he has to go running

935
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
and remember which skull goes on which bookshelf

936
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,480
to open up the hard, cold stone staircase

937
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
to the one toilet in the house.

938
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,320
But still, even he would not be like,

939
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
this was, guys, I blew it.

940
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,360
He's probably gotta keep it.

941
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,440
I just want a studio apartment.

942
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,200
He's probably gotta keep up pretenses.

943
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,040
Known castle-haver Richard Garriott

944
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
probably has to continue telling people

945
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,640
how great it is to live in a castle.

946
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,800
That's all I'm saying.

947
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,520
I would like to have a castle.

948
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,120
But I don't know that I would like to live in it.

949
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,280
They don't seem comfortable.

950
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,960
They're all made out of rocks.

951
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
What are you gonna fucking do with it?

952
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,240
What would I do with it?

953
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I would let people go through it for tours

954
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
and charge them money,

955
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
which is what I think people in Europe do

956
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
if they own a castle.

957
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, that's how they make ends meet,

958
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,560
is they have to turn it into a B&B or something.

959
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,600
Yeah, and meanwhile they live above a bar downtown

960
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,640
and they're having a great time.

961
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,720
I'd probably turn it into a fucking cool Airsoft course,

962
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
like an Airsoft arena.

963
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,440
That's a good idea.

964
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,120
I'd make it a Magic Quest place.

965
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,800
Oh yeah, that's pretty good.

966
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,960
I would probably make mine like LARP,

967
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
like a Dungeons and Dragons LARP.

968
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,520
Like a LARP thing?

969
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,320
Yeah.

970
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,720
Pretty good.

971
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,120
Rent it out.

972
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,600
Maybe make it like a B&B,

973
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,720
but fill it with board games and host.

974
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
D&D B&B?

975
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
D&D B&B, yes.

976
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,480
That's fucking funny.

977
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,200
That's fucking good.

978
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,480
That's good, TMTMTM.

979
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,840
That's a good joke for a podcast,

980
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,680
but also like good thing for life

981
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,440
if anybody wants that, you can have it.

982
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,320
D&D B&B.

983
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,120
I'm freaking out.

984
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,480
Yeah, I'm rich.

985
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,960
Because how good these ideas and funny ideas are.

986
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeah, listen, we almost don't need this.

987
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,720
I feel like at this point,

988
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,040
because it's like we've got a lot of million dollar.

989
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,480
What?

990
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,360
Good news, Justin.

991
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,800
We're not going to keep the money

992
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
from Money Zone this week.

993
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,320
Yeah, this week we are donating

994
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
the ad money from the episode

995
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.

996
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,080
Marsha P. Johnson was an incredible

997
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,160
black trans activist during the Stonewall riots.

998
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,480
And the Marsha P. Johnson Institute

999
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,520
goes to support and fight for the human rights

1000
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
of black trans people in America.

1001
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
And it's a rad organization.

1002
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,640
We're going to include a link

1003
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,680
to where you can support the Marsha P. Johnson Institute

1004
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
in the episode description.

1005
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
So yeah, do that.

1006
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,640
And we're going to talk about some sponsors

1007
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,600
that sell products and services.

1008
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,720
Whoa.

1009
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,600
Yeah, that was smooth.

1010
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Thanks, bud.

1011
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:22,480
I love my post office.

1012
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
I'm a first name basis with everybody there.

1013
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,160
Love to go there.

1014
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,800
Love it.

1015
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,040
But right now, you know,

1016
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
if I can avoid going out,

1017
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
if I can avoid going somewhere,

1018
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,360
no matter how personally painful it may be for me,

1019
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm going to do it.

1020
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,520
You can get a lot of the services,

1021
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
except for the friendly smiles,

1022
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,400
that you get at the post office with stamps.com.

1023
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Brings all the services of the post office

1024
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,720
right into your home

1025
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,640
or wherever you're hiding away right now.

1026
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,680
You can use your computer to print official US postage

1027
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,920
24 hours a day, seven days a week

1028
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
for any letter, any package, any class of mail,

1029
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
anywhere you want to send it.

1030
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,040
And once your mail is ready,

1031
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
you just leave it for your mail carrier.

1032
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,000
You schedule a free package pickup

1033
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
or you just drop it in a mailbox.

1034
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,440
It's just that easy and no human contact

1035
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
required with stamps.com.

1036
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,640
I almost said scamps.com.

1037
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,680
That'd be a good website too

1038
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,160
if anybody's in the market.

1039
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,880
You know you can't say the name.

1040
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,280
I'm very sure that scamps.com is...

1041
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
Oh, Justin.

1042
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh, no.

1043
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,240
Oh, this URL redirects

1044
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,040
to some truly heinous business friend.

1045
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,360
Oh my God.

1046
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,440
Oh, look at the scamps.

1047
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,960
Oh, God, no.

1048
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,720
What's the number for FBI?

1049
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,800
It's just full of scamps.

1050
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,400
They're doing all kinds of shenanigans.

1051
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
No way, man.

1052
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,200
That one's got a slingshot.

1053
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,640
They fucking just stole a pie out of a windowsill.

1054
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,360
Oh, no, he's got one of those sassy grins.

1055
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,760
Oh, that one just conned a friend

1056
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,520
into painting the fence for him.

1057
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,240
Right now, our listeners get a special offer

1058
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,360

1059
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,200
and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

1061
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

1062

and type in my brother.

1063
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,480
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

1064
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,160
Well, this is just a big JPEG of bug hauls alpha

1065
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,840
from the Little Rascals movie.

1066
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,560
Hey, Griffin, can I ask you a question?

1067
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:24,880
Uh-huh.

1068
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,960
Av-hay-oo-yay-in-bay-inking-thay about a e-learning ray.

1069
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
Have you been thinking about learning that language

1070
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,240
you took in high school again or college,

1071
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,000
but think it'll take too much time?

1072
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,560
I was trying to do Pig Latin.

1073
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,920
I know, but you couldn't even do that.

1074
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,480
So I think Babbel may be a little bit above your pay grade,

1075
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,600
but probably not.

1076
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,880
You should dip into it anyway,

1077
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
because learning is fun.

1078
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,680
Yes, Babbel can help you relearn that language fast.

1079
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
Babbel is designed to quickly get you speaking

1080
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,920
your new language within weeks

1081
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
with daily 10 to 15 minute lessons.

1082
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,120
And listen, we all got 10 to 15 minutes.

1083
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,240
You got it.

1084
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
You just put all your toilet time together.

1085
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Yeah, and you've been listening to this podcast

1086
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,360
for what, 40 minutes?

1087
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,920
Thank you.

1088
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,720
Good point, Travis.

1089
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,360
Turn off this podcast.

1090
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,240
Yeah, listen, this says weeks with daily 10 to 15,

1091
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,280
what about just one day?

1092
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
What if you just did it all in one day?

1093
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
I don't think they want us to say or endorse that.

1094
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
Pop a limitless pill and learn this language.

1095
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
Pop a limitless pill and do it all in one day.

1096
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,360
And then do another course the next day.

1097
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,880
I've tried to learn Spanish several times,

1098
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,960
never quite stuck, but I have really been enjoying

1099
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,560
going through Babbel and doing the lessons.

1100
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,280
They're the most sort of natural and fun to do lessons

1101
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,240
that I have found for sort of brushing up,

1102
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
but also like just learning new vocabulary

1103
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,800
and stuff like that.

1104
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,840
It is a really, really good service.

1105
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,840
You know what language I learned in high school?

1106
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,400
What, Griffin?

1107
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,440
The language of love.

1108
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:00,880
Gross.

1109
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,000
It called me Porky Pig.

1110
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:04,960
Okay.

1111
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,080
Because of how much-

1112
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,480
Gross.

1113
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,480
Gross.

1114
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,000
Because of how much-

1115
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,360
I was mid coffee sip.

1116
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,480
I thought I'd earned it after my great personal endorsement.

1117
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,520
But no, you have to take it away from me.

1118
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,120
Before you talk about all your porking,

1119
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,920
can I mention that Babbel has speech recognition technology

1120
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,800
that helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent?

1121
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,120
Go ahead and do that, but I want Babbel to know

1122
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,720
I am going to talk more about that immediately after the ad

1123
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
so that it'll be sort of sandwiched in there.

1124
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,360
So it's helping you with your accent and your pronunciation too.

1125
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,080
Right now, Babbel is offering our listeners three months free

1126
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,920

1131
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,680
Promo code MYBROTHER.

1132
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
Babbel, language for life.

1133
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,200
So you're probably thinking like porky pig,

1134
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
probably because he was porking a lot, right?

1135
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,800
But it was-

1136
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
No, it was my tech-

1137
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,240
My technique was I would get down there

1138
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,640
and just be like,

1139
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:18,240
a-dee-bee-dee-bee-dee-bee-dee.

1140
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:43,360
Oh, fuck.

1141
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,800
You dumb piece of shit.

1142
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,440
Despicable people.

1143
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
How I related to you.

1144
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,280
Absolutely the worst.

1145
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,280
Man, this is the first time I've ever been sad

1146
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
that listeners can't tell our voices apart

1147
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,440
because I'm afraid they'll think I said nothing.

1148
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,800
I almost didn't say anything.

1149
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,840
So off-brand.

1150
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,280
All our brands are fucked.

1151
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,240
That's all of us.

1152
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,600
Macho Man to the top rope.

1153
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,840
The flying elbow.

1154
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,400
The cover.

1155
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
We've got a new champion.

1156
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,280
We're here with Macho Man Randy Savage

1157
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,160
after his big win to become the new world champion.

1158
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,920
What are you going to do now, Mach?

1159
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,080
I'm going to go listen to the newest episode

1160
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,080
of the Types of Fights podcast.

1161
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,800
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,640
Tell us more about this podcast.

1163
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,160
It's the podcast of power.

1164
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,520
Too sweet to be sour.

1165
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
Funky like a monkey.

1166
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,720
Woke discussions, man.

1167
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,760
And jokes about wrestlers' fashion choices.

1168
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,440
Myself excluded.

1169
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah.

1170
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
I can't wait to listen.

1171
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,560
Neither can I.

1172
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,680
You can find it Thursdays on Maximum Fun.

1173
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,960
Oh, yeah.

1174
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,440
Dig it.

1175
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,640
Yeah, I'm not even going to waste anybody's time.

1176
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,680
I want to munch.

1177
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,180
Squad.

1178
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,800
I want to munch.

1179
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,300
Squad.

1180
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,080
I tried to give that a moderate edge

1181
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,240
because, folks, I'm so happy to report

1182
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,880
that we have a new munch squad.

1183
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,800
We've gone back to the future.

1184
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,080
From the now time.

1185
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,760
Well, from like a week ago.

1186
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,520
But still, from this era, kind of wild.

1187
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,200
Actually, not sure it's tasteful.

1188
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,760
But these brands are going to brand.

1189
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,280
This is their thing that they do.

1190
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,600
And here's the story.

1191
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
A lot of you sent this in, so thank you so much.

1192
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,880
Limited edition Pringles flavor packs

1193
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
the juicy layers of a Wendy's Baconator

1194
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,080
into one crunchy bite.

1195
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,600
Huh.

1196
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,040
Bacon lovers, rejoice.

1197
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
I'm going to do something real quick.

1198
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,040
I'm going to enter that phrase in quotes into Google

1199
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,200
and see how many hits that I get.

1200
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,320
And the answer is 8,760.

1201
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,200
So they have a lot to be thankful for, I think, right now.

1202
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,840
But in this situation, it's that the masters of flavor

1203
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,840
at Pringles, which I bet that is not a label

1204
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,680
that has been applied to them very frequently,

1205
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,720
but the masters of flavor at Pringles have done it again.

1206
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,920
This time in partnership with the queen of hamburgers.

1207
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,480
Oh, boy.

1208
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,080
Wendy's.

1209
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,800
Just titles being thrown around.

1210
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,760
Just the, yeah.

1211
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,520
The new limited edition Pringles Baconator packs

1212
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,600
all the delicious flavors of packs all the delicious

1213
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,080
layers of flavor found in the fan favorite

1214
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,280
Wendy's Baconator into one perfectly delicious bite.

1215
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
When it comes to delivering on a mouthwatering

1216
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,520
delicious hamburger, Wendy's doesn't cut corners

1217
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,160
with a half pound of fresh, never frozen beef,

1218
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,640
American cheese, six strips of crispy apple

1219
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,760
with smoked bacon.

1220
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,880
This is a chip.

1221
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,120
Why are we wasting our time talking about this?

1222
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,640
Ketchup and mayonnaise for a Wendy's Baconator,

1223
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,960
replicating those delicious layers into one single Pringles crisp.

1224
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,840
No challenge is too large for Pringles.

1225
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,640
I've heard that.

1226
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,520
I have heard.

1227
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,440
That's how they're also working on world peace right now.

1228
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,240
If no challenge is too large for Pringles,

1229
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,520
I would submit that they are maybe wasting their talents

1230
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,920
creating bacon hamburger chips.

1231
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,520
There's some other pressing concerns

1232
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,040
that I would love for them to address.

1233
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,800
So Griffin, who's was funnier?

1234
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,720
I've been so distracted this whole time

1235
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
because I've been thinking about how delightful it would be

1236
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,200
if Wendy's didn't know about this.

1237
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,600
And Pringles was just like, Wendy's doesn't fucking

1238
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,480
cut any corners.

1239
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,160
Wendy's brings you the good burgers.

1240
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,360
We love Wendy's.

1241
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,080
So we did a chip on them.

1242
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,120
And Wendy's like, oh.

1243
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,880
Thank you, I guess.

1244
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,380
Thanks.

1245
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,240
We squished down 20 of your hamburgers into every chip.

1246
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:13,040
We destroyed them like the guy in No Country for Old Men.

1247
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,520
We just went baconator to baconator,

1248
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,080
euthanizing them and squishing them down into chips

1249
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,360
to prove our love to you.

1250
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
Wendy's, please recognize us.

1251
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,760
The Pringles brand delivers insanely accurate

1252
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,880
flavor combinations that are both delicious and convenient,

1253
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,320
said Derrick McGuire, senior director of marketing

1254
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,880
for Pringles, who seems biased.

1255
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,720
What does that mean, convenient?

1256
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,320
It's convenient.

1257
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,920
With such a strong fan base,

1258
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,840
we knew we had to nail that fresh,

1259
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,960
never frozen Wendy's flavor perfectly.

1260
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
Fucking if you could eat a chip and be like,

1261
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,040
well, this beef's never been frozen.

1262
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,680
I can tell.

1263
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,120
Luckily, our flavor experts were up to the task.

1264
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,680
The Pringles baconator crisps are the perfect way

1265
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,600
to enjoy the savory goodness all in one bite.

1266
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,280
Yes, Travis, convenient.

1267
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,720
Indulging in a Wendy's baconator craving

1268
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,240
has never been easier.

1269
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,560
Just break open a can, pop a crisp,

1270
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,360
and experience the wonders straight from your pantry.

1271
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,240
Yeah, it's for people that it's like,

1272
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,280
God, it would be tough to get a hamburger right now.

1273
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,880
I'm not sure I can get at it together,

1274
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,640
but I do have a craving.

1275
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,920
Maybe I'll eat a chip of it.

1276
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,320
But this is making it sound like it's a future food

1277
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,640
of like a Wendy's baconator in Pilfer.

1278
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,320
Like you would eat one chip and be like,

1279
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,560
I am stuffed.

1280
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,240
That's a baconator right there.

1281
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,880
I do not trust Pringles to do a slam dunk

1282
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,720
when it comes to recreating flavors,

1283
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,760
because in my mind, the different flavors of Pringles

1284
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,640
are regular salty, and then like,

1285
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
maybe I'll give you sour cream,

1286
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,400
and then every other one is just the same sort

1287
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,800
of unconscionably zesty sort of miasma

1288
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,440
that I could not diagnose gun to my head.

1289
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,280
Here's good news.

1290
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,480
Each can comes with a code on the seal

1291
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,600
that can be used to score a free Wendy's baconator,

1292
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,720
son of baconator, or breakfast baconator with purchase

1293
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,480
when you order through the Wendy's app.

1294
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,560
Hey, friends, it's me.

1295
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,600
If you use this code to get a son of baconator

1296
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,680
when you could have gotten a free baconator,

1297
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm going to have you committed.

1298
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,240
That is for intense lack of value recognition.

1299
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,680
That would be a terrible use.

1300
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,240
Cut it in half.

1301
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,800
Yes.

1302
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,720
Cut it in half if it's too much for you.

1303
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,480
But don't waste the opportunity.

1304
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,320
Take it up a notch.

1305
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,480
And pile Pringles baconator on top of a Wendy's baconator.

1306
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,120
Whoa.

1307
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,320
My ass.

1308
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,880
No.

1309
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,320
What are you talking about?

1310
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,820
Whoa.

1311
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,880
Can you imagine?

1312
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,200
Why?

1313
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,400
Why would you do that?

1314
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,240
Or dip the crisp and frosty for a sweet and salty treat.

1315
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,640
Now.

1316
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,160
Now that sounds good as fuck.

1317
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,760
Yeah, now I'm on board with that one.

1318
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,120
That made me high.

1319
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,440
Whoa.

1320
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,000
Instead of making me crave that, it made me high.

1321
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,120
That's how much I want that.

1322
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,720
At Wendy's, quote, at Wendy's, the baconator has long been

1323
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,600
an iconic bacon cheeseburger like no other.

1324
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,760
That is a fucking wild sentence.

1325
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,520
We're just going to revisit it one more time.

1326
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,960
And when you're imagining the verbiage in here,

1327
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,600
note the bacon cheeseburger is capitalized.

1328
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,360
So maybe that's its formal name.

1329
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,480
At Wendy's, the baconator has long been an iconic bacon

1330
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,000
cheeseburger like no other.

1331
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,840
With stacked fresh beef, which I guess is a descriptor

1332
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,840
that leads you to imply quality.

1333
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,080
Oh, is that beef stacked?

1334
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,680
Yuma, yuma.

1335
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,320
I usually lay my shit out on side by side,

1336
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,520
not even on the bun.

1337
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,320
That's wild.

1338
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,040
I didn't even think about that.

1339
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,000
When did you stack this?

1340
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,440
You stacked this yesterday?

1341
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,800
Nah, stacked fresh.

1342
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,000
Oven cooked, applewood smoked bacon.

1343
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,840
Ooh, you use the oven on it?

1344
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,240
Damn.

1345
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,960
And piping hot cheese.

1346
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,280
What?

1347
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,240
This is not part of it.

1348
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,480
We knew we were going, it was going to be a challenge

1349
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,120
to get all that flavor and goodness into one bite.

1350
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,360
Says, and I'm so happy to have him back,

1351
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,440
Carl Laredo, Wendy's US chief marketing officer.

1352
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,880
We're excited to work with the flavor experts at Pringles

1353
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,360
to deliver the tastes our fans know and love in a unique way.

1354
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,840
Hey guys, words still mean shit.

1355
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,920
Deliver the tastes our fans know and love

1356
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,520
in a unique way is nothing.

1357
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
No, I'll tell you what, what would be a unique way

1358
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,320
is if the flavor kings at Pringles

1359
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,000
could somehow aerosolize the Baconator

1360
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,040
and I could inhale it.

1361
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,720
Yes, put it in an IV.

1362
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,200
Yes.

1363
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,400
We know our Baconator fanatics will be in for quite a treat

1364
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
when they taste how insanely accurate

1365
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
Pringles made this delicious crisp.

1366
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,960
This is so accurate.

1367
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,160
Ah, it's accurate.

1368
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,520
You can tell that, that's the end of it,

1369
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,560
that you could tell that these people have been like,

1370
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,240
that none of these people said any of this

1371
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,480
because no one has ever called them a crisp

1372
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,440
in their entire life unless they're legally, yeah.

1373
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,720
Oh, it's, no, it's actually because it's potato granules

1374
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,560
and the potato lobby made it,

1375
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,600
the potato chip lobby made it

1376
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,960
so that they couldn't call them chips.

1377
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,080
So they were legally barred from calling them chips.

1378
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,880
It's a true story.

1379
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,320
I mean, out of granules to make it easier to transport.

1380
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,800
Oh God, I wish I could fucking wedgie you over Skype.

1381
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,240
I wish Skype would add some sort of-

1382
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,160
Use their transfers because there was a lot of breakage.

1383
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,880
I just got confirmation back on my cameo request

1384
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,120
from Lance Bass to come wedgie Justin.

1385
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,040
He should be showing up right now.

1386
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,960
I'm gonna wedgie you to the fucking moon.

1387
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,240
Can we do this second question?

1388
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,760
Because it'll be very fast.

1389
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,240
Sure, yeah, let's do this second question.

1390
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,600
I am anticipating just a real quick in and out revolving door

1391
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,520
and we give them a harsh talking to

1392
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
and then the door finishes revolving.

1393
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,200
That's what people come to this show for,

1394
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,320
harsh talkings to.

1395
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,400
Hey brothers, I work at a job that allows me

1396
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,600
to drive around my city all day long making frequent stops.

1397
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,960
I keep a small fishing pole and a box of tackle in my car

1398
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,400
as there are lots of good fishing holes

1399
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,000
randomly throughout my city.

1400
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
Anytime I have a spare hour between sessions,

1401
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,560
I will go to the nearest pond or fishing hole

1402
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,920
and have a few casts.

1403
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,840
Recently, I found a choice looking pond

1404
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,440
that I've never seen anybody fishing at.

1405
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,960
It seems like a prime spot.

1406
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,720
However, it's located in a cemetery-

1407
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,760
Stop it!

1408
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,120
There are no signs saying do not fish here,

1409
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,760
but I feel weird about just walking up with my gear

1410
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,800
and making a cast.

1411
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,760
Is this wrong?

1412
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,040
Am I being paranoid?

1413
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,800
Am I just begging to be cursed?

1414
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,840
Please help.

1415
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,240
That's from Fishy Dilemma in Oklahoma City,

1416
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,320
the city of a thousand fishing holes.

1417
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,080
Apparently.

1418
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,840
I've just figured out what I want my epitaph to say,

1419
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,960
I guess, and it is do not fish here

1420
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,800
because apparently we need one of them in every cemetery

1421
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,080
informing people that this cemetery water feature

1422
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,760
probably does not have game fish in it

1423
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,160
for you to go digging around in.

1424
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,760
Honey, I brought home some koi for us to fry up.

1425
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,480
Graveyard koi, honey, my favorite.

1426
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,720
The spirits of ancestors have been transferred into them

1427
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,800
and that's where the flavor comes from.

1428
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,920
I've never, it's the weirdest fucking thing.

1429
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,800
Beautiful, beautiful big pond

1430
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,560
and I've never seen anyone fishing at it.

1431
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,520
It's such a prime spot too.

1432
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,440
I would also point out, question asker,

1433
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,200
if you include the phrase,

1434
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,480
but I feel weird about just walking up with my gear

1435
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,840
and making a cast,

1436
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,000
and then follow that up with next sentence,

1437
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,040
is this wrong?

1438
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,040
Kind of seems like you might know the answer

1439
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,880
to that particular question.

1440
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,080
Am I begging?

1441
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,040
Yeah, I just kind of post up on someone's headstone

1442
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,520
with my Milwaukee's best.

1443
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,240
That's great.

1444
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,200
Cast on in there.

1445
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,240
It's just, the thought that you are begging to be cursed

1446
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,080
is also like, that shouldn't have to be the repercussion here.

1447
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,960
If I am at Peppy Pep's funeral,

1448
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,360
although it's more of a funerals

1449
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,120
because Peppy Pep had some really zany requests,

1450
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,600
but I do look-

1451
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,720
He lived a good life.

1452
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
He led a great fun life

1453
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,200
until he died in that turbo hang glider accident.

1454
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,440
But I do look-

1455
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
You begged him not to sign the release forms.

1456
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,720
And I just finished singing, dancing on the ceiling,

1457
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,120
and I look to the left,

1458
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,720
and just out of eye shot of this incredible funeral

1459
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,560
is you and your waiters fucking doing some fly fishing

1460
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,720
into the, there's no way.

1461
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,240
There's no way that will be acceptable.

1462
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,040
I don't even know what this next sentence means,

1463
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,560
but me and the entire funeral party will come get you.

1464
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,480
And I don't even know what that means,

1465
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,400
but there's no way we can let that be.

1466
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,440
Can you imagine being like the groundskeeper at a cemetery

1467
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,000
and like walking up and seeing somebody fishing in a pond?

1468
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,760
Like, I don't even think you get angry

1469
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,960
so much as you just be like, you can't do this.

1470
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,400
No, you can't do this.

1471
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,240
I shouldn't have to tell you not to catch those.

1472
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,640
We don't stock this pond with fish for you to catch.

1473
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,680
These are for the ghosts to catch, you know that.

1474
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,640
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our show.

1475
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1476
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,880
We hope you're hanging in there.

1477
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,960
If you're protesting, we hope that you're trying

1478
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
to stay as safe as possible.

1479
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,560
If you're not able to, or you feel like you need

1480
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,240
to do something and participate,

1481
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,640
you can go to blacklivesmatters.carrd.co.

1482
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,080
There's petitions you can sign, places to call,

1483
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,160
you can donate even without spending money,

1484
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,520
voting, information for protesters, whatever you need.

1485
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,600
That is a great place to start.

1486
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,000
And we would encourage you to do so just as,

1487
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,400
even though it may not be as front of mind in the media,

1488
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,840
that, you know, the push still goes on there.

1489
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,480
And again, check out the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.

1490
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,840
We got links to that in the episode description.

1491
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,320
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1492
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,120
for these four theme songs.

1493
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,800
A departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1494
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:21,440
Great tunes, great track, lots of positive vibes there, man.

1495
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,160
And thank you to MaximumFun.org for having us on the network.

1496
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,520
Check out all the great shows there,

1497
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,720
like Tights and Fights and Fanti and all the others.

1498
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,760
MaximumFun.org.

1499
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,960
You can go to McElroyMerch.com and check out

1500
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,960
all the cool McElroy merch,

1501
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,240
including a good out here t-shirt

1502
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,520
and a phantasmal and resplendent pen.

1503
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,760
And again, both of those are the proceeds

1504
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,840
from which we'll go to the Trevor Project

1505
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,080
in celebration of Pride Month.

1506
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,040
So go check those out.

1507
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:54,960
Is that it?

1508
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,560
Should we do the final?

1509
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:56,960
Yeah, let's do it.

1510
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,760
Here's the final Yahoo.

1511
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,440
It was sent in by lots of people

1512
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,280
and it is an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1513
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,160
And their name is actually Cram.

1514
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,440
Cram.

1515
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:09,840
Cram.

1516
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,720
Cram, you say.

1517
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,520
Is that like Cram Cram is the name?

1518
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,960
No, it's just Cram.

1519
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,320
I misspoke the first time.

1520
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,440
It's C-R-A-M-M.

1521
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,440
Thank you for your honesty.

1522
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,240
I appreciate that.

1523
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,040
Cram asks,

1524
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,720
I thought Tim Allen was dead.

1525
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,240
Who am I confusing him with?

1526
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,680
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

1527
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1528
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1529
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,080
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1530
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,280
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
