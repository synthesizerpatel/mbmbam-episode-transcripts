1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to what is sure to be maybe the last episode of 2018 or the

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,480
first episode of 2019. Time shall tell. It's always hard to tell when editing will occur.

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Yeah, but welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for this, the most modern

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,000
era we've yet encountered. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your brother. Well, see, I was

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,120
gonna say I was the oldest brother because you'd missed your chance. Okay, I'm your

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,880
middlest brother, Travis McElroy. What a fucking sloppy intro. What a sloppy, nasty. I know the

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,720
holidays got us tired. Organic. It's not organic. It's sloppy and rotten. We made it ourselves with

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,520
our own two hands. And I'm Griffin McElroy. The baby knew you. This is great. Oh, there's my dogs.

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
Oh my god, it's the worst intro we've ever done. Justin, quick, drop some spaghetti on the

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
microphone or something. Drop some spaghetti on the keyboard and spend the next 15 minutes

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,800
cleaning it up. I'm gonna talk about the coffee I'm drinking in long-winded and uninteresting terms.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,200
So Justin, get to work on the spaghetti. Travis, get your dog stuff going. I'll take it from here.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,200
No, I'm keeping those dogs quiet now. Give them treats. All right. This is gonna be a weird one,

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,920
huh? Because it always is around this year in times. It's either a celebration of like,

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,360
it's like a wake. You know, the year is dying. Or it's like a birthday party for a new year.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
Pretzel flips? What is happening? No, that's the treats for my good, good puppies.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,960
All right, this is gonna be a wild one. This is like almost an editing challenge.

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,720
We should send this one out to like all the editors of all the top podcasts and see who

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:38,080
can make the most listenable thing. Fix this one, Gimlet. Yeah, come on, Gimlet. So what's it all

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
about? 2019, a lot of people are asking about. And I think it's time that we fucking solve it.

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
Do we want to solve that up top? Is that probably the best? I think it's gonna take us a half hour.

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,160
Traditionally, it takes us about a half hour. I have about 10 ideas. So there's some housekeeping

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,080
to get out of the way before we get into the discussion proper. First, I would just like to

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,000
start by reviewing our themes throughout the years. A quick tour through history.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Yeah. And how well we've accomplished them. Yeah, that's the part I'm worried about.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm not gonna remember that for all these. But okay, so 2010, Zolo. Not much of a theme.

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,800
We were in our infancy there. At the same time, maybe our best theme.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,400
A very good theme, we can all agree, but it was Zolo in 2010 because it looked like the word Zolo.

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah, sure. And then someone stole that and made a wedding registry website out of it.

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Yeah, it's no good. 2000 in Heaven. That was 2011.

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
Let's get right with Christ. Yeah, right with Christ. That was our evangelical year.

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,440
Then we had getting it in 20 does. Oh, yeah. 20 does.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,320
20 does. That is so broad and its broadness can be deeply problematic, I feel like.

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,880
Yeah, I mean, yeah. A lot of our early stuff was very problematic.

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,600
Sure, sure, sure. This one was,

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,800
I liked this one, 2013, dig it up and get it out.

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah, that one I actually like a lot. That was kind of when we introduced subtitles

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,560
because we started needing them. So 2013, dig it up, get it out. After that, we had 20 forward

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,800
from episode 181, Boy Car, 20 forward. Can I ask you guys a question?

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah. Do you remember 2014? I don't remember 2014 at all. I don't remember the whole year 2014.

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,360
When people mention it, I feel like I just skipped that one. I don't remember 2014 at all.

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,720
I blend every year before 2016 in a large miasma in a pot called good.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah. And then it was just kind of other. It's like good and other.

48
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,600
It is when my daughter was born. So my first child was born in 2014. So I do remember that.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,200
I remember 2015. 2015 was 20 grift team.

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,440
Yes.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
20 grift team, the con is on.

52
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah. And that's when I did steal Declaration of Independence.

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah.

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
2016, building bridges.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Probably the first one to say just didn't build much bridge.

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,560
No.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
Probably our biggest win.

58
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Well, the problem was is that year I took it too literally and I did build that one bridge

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
out of wood and stone.

60
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Yeah. It was more like a bridge to Terabithia where we all kind of fell right off it and did

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,440
die in the creek. Boy, it was some foresight.

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
Is that what that book's about?

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah. It would have been good if we had had a little foresight and been like 2016.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,680
Whoops.

66
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
Oh, here it goes. Hold on.

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Here's 20 serpentine, keep them guessing. That was a powerful theme, I thought.

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes.

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:53,280
And I feel like a lot of people did zag on them. We zagged on television by kicking off our show

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
and then television zagged on us.

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,560
Us.

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,080
Yeah. Zagged their zag nuts right on our fucking foreheads. Sure, yeah.

73
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,640
And then we had collaborate teen stronger together, a powerful year.

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,160
Now, how do you think you've done as far as collaborating goes?

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,720
Some good collaboration. I mean, for us personally, we released our graphic novel.

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
We collaborated with our daddy, yeah.

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Collaborate. Well, we collaborated with Carrie Peach and the fine folks that are our publisher.

78
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
We collaborated on the Mysterious Package Company thing. That was a collaboration.

79
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,080
That was cool.

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
We fulfilled that.

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah, we did it.

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,640
That was good. We did some collaborating, collaborated on some

83
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
shirts and merch and posters. We did lots of collaborations.

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
Hey, I made the new track with Shaggy.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Yes, it was in fact me.

86
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah, after years of growth and reflection, I can admit it was me.

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,320
Now, Travis, you had an idea that maybe we should get out of the way first about

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,920
how bad it was and then we'll get on with the show.

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,880
Well, now that you've had some time to marinate on it.

90
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
20 equine teen, this year we buy a horse.

92
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
It's buying that I don't like, Trav. If I could just ride-

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,920
Steel?

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Steel. I mean, if you go out into the- I live in Texas, baby.

95
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,920
The Lone Star State, deep in the heart of it, and I feel like there's probably some fucking horses

96
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,920
here out in a field that nobody owns except God, even though you can't really technically own a

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,400
horse. I could possess one that is wild and we could become best friends.

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm happy to change it to this year we acquire through some sort of means a horse.

99
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
It's gotta be. It's way too long.

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,480
It's so long. It's so long. So we've ruled that one out pretty definitively.

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,200
The other problem is horse jokes are oh so over. So, so over.

102
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,680
Wow.

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,680
So over. Yeah. Next year, all the jokes are about vegetables and how yucky they are.

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,320
Oh. That's a preview for 2019 is how gross vegetables are. So enjoy those.

105
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,320
I would, I also, I think I previously mentioned 20 vaccine, which I still enjoy very much.

106
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
I could go for any year.

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah, it could go for any year. So I think that we could roll that one out.

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
So maybe that's just like a rolling one forever.

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,360
Well, except for next, the year after 2020, it can't be done anymore. But yes,

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm going to start throwing some of mine out because I got.

111
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,640
Hold on. I got a Google document. I got to open a Google document.

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Okay, please.

113
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Because we're business professionals now.

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,360
Yes.

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
I actually, I have an amazing one that was picked to me by Teresa,

116
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,160
but I actually, I've learned from my mistakes. I'm going to wait.

117
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,840
Yeah, you have to make yours go last.

118
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
We never pick the first one.

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,480
No, no, we never do.

120
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
No, we got to burn through some chaff to get to my wheat.

121
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Let me just put in, as long as that's how we're thinking about this,

122
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
let me put out this early contender, that's not going to make it,

123
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,880
but 20 vine teen, a six second celebration.

124
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,480
And this is sort of just getting psyched about it coming back as V2.

125
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
Nice.

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,520
Now that's officially not happening.

127
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,880
No, there is going to be a vine successor. They are making a vine successor next year.

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,760
They came out and said, like, okay, yes, we are going to do it.

129
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
And then they came out after that and said, no, we're not.

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
They didn't cancel it a second time.

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
Who do you think you're talking to?

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Do you really think you know more about Vine than me?

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
Griffin has Google Alerts set up.

134
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah, dog.

135
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,240
There will be no Vine 2. It's called Byte, B-Y-T-E, and that doesn't work.

136
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,960
That doesn't rhyme. Yeah, it's done. Get out of here, 20 vine teen.

137
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,120
Okay, I'm sure there's Google Alerts.

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
God, this is not going to be funny, but it is going to be necessary.

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,360
What about 20 sign teen? What's AsaBase up to?

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Yeah, see, I had 20 signs teen revisiting a Shyamalan classic.

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh.

142
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,080
And it could be about, like, you know, the sort of message of signs, which is, um, God-

143
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Water bad.

144
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Well, God makes things happen that help you fight the aliens.

145
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
God hates aliens.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
God hates aliens because he didn't make them,

147
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,080
so he makes things happen that helps you fight them, which is good.

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,400
I like how, can we spoil signs for a second?

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah.

150
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,160
I like how God had to kill Mel Gibson's wife so she could instruct Joaquin Phoenix to hit

151
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,520
the glass with the bat.

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,240
He would have just stood there holding the bat thinking, well, what now?

153
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,920
Okay, here's mine. My current, my favorite currently.

154
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,420
Okay.

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,080
20 brine teen. The sea is calling.

156
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Hmm. This is good. I tell you, I like that one.

157
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm very afraid of the ocean and everything in it, and above it, and on top of it, and

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,320
the big waves that it makes.

159
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
But I do, I do kind of like that though, Griffin, because the sea is calling could both be like,

160
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,040
you know, come to me, join me here, but it could also be like in Scream when the killer

161
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,080
is calling, like the sea is calling from inside your house.

162
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,480
That's fun. We've never done one that's like an explicit threat from, like, a body of water.

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah.

164
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,560
That could be good, Justin.

165
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
Now here's alternate subtitle that really changes it.

166
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,280
20 brine teen. Make meat a treat.

167
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,680
There's a lot of different preparations of meat that would be improved if you brine them

168
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
first. You're going to lock in a lot of moisture and a lot of flavor.

169
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,640
If you're not brining your turkey or chicken, even beef, I think that you're really missing

170
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
out on some big bowl flavors.

171
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,320
And this is really going to go great with my making fun of vegetables sort of ideas.

172
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Can I pitch a subtitle for 20 brine teen?

173
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Yeah.

174
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040
20 brine teen. Are you going to eat your pickle?

175
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
Hmm. Are you? Hey, you're going to eat that pickle?

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,040
Yeah.

177
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,120
Yeah. Listen, it's a specific year. We've shot big before and failed. We tried with building

178
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,960
bridges. We didn't do it. This time, this is all about like, you know what?

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
Attainable goals.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
You're looking at the pickle. I'm not going to eat it. I wish you would just ask.

181
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,720
Sure. Eight straight years of not fulfilling the goals we set before you must be sort of

182
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,560
soul crushing. Let's give you a slow ball.

183
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
An attainable one.

184
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
An attainable one. I got one here. 20 spine teen. Check your posture.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,880
That could be good. Right now, I'm sitting in a chair. I've got both legs sort of up

186
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,520
in the seat. One is sort of folded upwards and my elbow is resting against it. I look

187
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,040
like a, you know, I'm about to be a cool book reader in front of a fireplace or something

188
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,080
like that, but my posture is absolute dookie right now.

189
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,040
I always sit like that crisscross applesauce when I'm in my office chair and I can't imagine

190
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,680
that's good for me.

191
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Oh man, I'm doing that too.

192
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
Yeah. It's almost like I'm playing the floor is lava every time I sit down to record or

193
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
edit, so that's not great.

194
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't think it's good.

195
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
I have one here.

196
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Wait, hold on. Before we move on, posture is important. You guys ever walk around? I

197
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,480
had this thing. I was walking around and I was at Charlie's school a few weeks back and

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
I was like, my posture is terrible. And I stood up straight and walked around and when

199
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,520
I did that, I instantly felt like some sort of elegant king. And I was like, I'm going

200
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,280
to do this all the time from here on out. And then I did it. But maybe if I had like

201
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,240
an extensive line of merchandise to reinforce it, then I might, you know, it might be a

202
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,040
little easier for me.

203
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,560
So what I've got here written down in my notebook that I have labeled very good ideas.

204
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
I have Kevin Klein teen.

205
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,760
Yeah, yeah, well, but Dave was a fucking banger, dude.

206
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
Yeah, dude, Dave fucking bangs, bro.

207
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
And there's no, I have a second one here, comma, Chris Klein teen.

208
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Okay. Well, I like the first one better because in and out dude fucking bangs.

209
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
In and out was good.

210
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,400
Wild Wild West does bang.

211
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,320
Hey guys, Fish Called Wanda, more like a Fish Called Good movie.

212
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah.

213
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,200
Yup.

214
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah.

215
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,720
I'm not writing that one down.

216
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:16,800
No.

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,640
You're not going to write down Kevin Klein teen?

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,840
How about this? 20 wine teen, better with age.

219
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,480
And this doesn't have to be about wine.

220
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,200
It could just be like, you are the wine and don't worry about getting older.

221
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
But see, you know what is the problem?

222
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,840
There's some shitty older people out there.

223
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah, they didn't get any better.

224
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,320
Unless they started out very bad.

225
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah.

226
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,720
Ooh. Now what if we made it like wine, W-H-I-N-E and it's like 20 wine teen,

227
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
and complain about it.

228
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,080
Yeah, that's good.

229
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
My food's cold.

230
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,120
I have a quartet here of suggestions that don't have 20 in them,

231
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
which I don't even know if we would consider.

232
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,720
You know what?

233
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
Collaborate teen didn't have 20 in it, so that's probably okay.

234
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,840
I got dollar sign teen, get the money.

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,160
Okay.

236
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,280
I got Frankenstein teen, befriend a monster.

237
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,360
I don't actually like the message of that one.

238
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah.

239
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,400
Okay.

240
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,800
But it could be Frankenstein teen, use what you got, use what you got.

241
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
Mm-hmm.

242
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
I want to hit you guys with one.

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:17,840
Okay.

244
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,720
20 mine teen, there's gold in them hills.

245
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,760
Wow.

246
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Now what is the sub, is it a literal golden hills?

247
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,160
No, I think all the-

248
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,520
What is it referencing?

249
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,240
If I understand that correctly, all the gold's gone.

250
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,360
We got it all.

251
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,600
Yeah.

252
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,480
But the metaphorical gold in your own personal hills, I think yet remains.

253
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,760
Interesting.

254
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,000
So I've got hills and gold in them.

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Yes, exactly.

256
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,880
There's gold, whatever the hills are in your life.

257
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
Are you talking about my lovely lumps?

258
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,760
Ooh.

259
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,120
There's gold in them hills.

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
There's gold in my lovely lumps?

261
00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:01,040
Okay, now I will say Griffin, if history has proven anything, yes, there is gold in them

262
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
there lumps.

263
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay, wow.

264
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,200
That could be good.

265
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,000
I have one here.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,840
This is the one that Theresa pitched to me.

267
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,800
Oh, yes.

268
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,760
That I love, and I've been very excited to share with you.

269
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay.

270
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Refined Teen, the Champagne of Years.

271
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,960
Refined Teen, so let's get Fancy Nancy on it is what you're saying.

272
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes.

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,680
Refined Teen.

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, it's that D in there, isn't it?

275
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,440
It's that naughty-

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
Well, we can go with Refined Teen.

277
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,760
Get fancy, get fancy on that.

278
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,040
The Champagne of Years.

279
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,000
The Champagne of Years is extremely powerful.

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah, what I like about it is that it gives us the highest probability of failure we've

281
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
ever had in a theme.

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,360
It could just be like twenty-fine teen, the Champagne of Years, but I don't know if that

283
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,640
gets it as across as Refined Teen, the Champagne of Years.

284
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,680
Now, this year would be all about like, are you worth it?

285
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah, you're worth it.

286
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
It's the Champagne of Years.

287
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,320
Yeah, oh, you should have a mimosa today, or like, yeah, go buy yourself those shoes

288
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,600
you've been looking at.

289
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,760
It's kind of a you're worth it is the whole deal of this year, and you make this year

290
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,600
nice for you.

291
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
And maybe it's like sleeping in, you know?

292
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,040
We are an oscillating fan for these fucking suggestions, these yearly mottos going between

293
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,520
get out there, make it better, do it together, and just fucking it's all about you, baby.

294
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
It's all about you this year, baby.

295
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
And maybe that's a natural process.

296
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,560
You've got to treat yourself and then go out and treat others because how can you know

297
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,640
real love before you know love yourself?

298
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,600
I should know.

299
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,720
Damn, that's good, Trav.

300
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
Yeah, is this anything?

301
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,160
Is it anything, if I were to say 20-fine-teen, fine, okay, fine.

302
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
So wait, like 20-fine-teen, I get it.

303
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Fine, okay, fine.

304
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,680
Yeah, and that's like a sort of acceptance, or is it like a sort of-

305
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
It's acceptance.

306
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
It's very powerful acceptance.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
But it sounds like a begrudging acceptance.

308
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Yeah, we shouldn't necessarily be espousing that, I feel like.

309
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,040
It's not fine, for the most part.

310
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,600
So that's the worst one yet.

311
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,080
I got actually on the other end of the spectrum, undermine-teen, destroy it from within.

312
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,720
And in this one, you're sort of a Splinter Cell agent inside the machine of your office,

313
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,760
the government, business, just anything like that.

314
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
Anything you can destroy from within, really.

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah, sure.

316
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,120
Sure.

317
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
Even if it's just like a group chat.

318
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
Yeah, and take that shit apart, plank by plank, nail by nail.

319
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,680
20-pine-teen, man, that smells good.

320
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,840
Write your own dumb themes in this document that Griffin isn't even in, please, please.

321
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
I can't keep up with all these dumbass ideas.

322
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
Okay, I actually have a winner here, but I was gonna save it for last, so it could win.

323
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,520
Before I get to it, realign-teen, new priorities, new you.

324
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,160
Ooh.

325
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,320
But the winner here is clearly 20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

326
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,400
20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

327
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,200
Okay.

328
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
Hiding your light under a bushel.

329
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,840
You know what, I wanna put a star next to it, I really like it.

330
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
Shine-teen, 20-shine-teen, unbushel your candle.

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,080
I think shine-teen is good, unbushel your candle is good.

332
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
Refine-teen, the champagne of years is definitely up there for me.

333
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,680
And I'm gonna just go ahead and say Frankenstein-teen.

334
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
See, I feel like we're not circling back to that one.

335
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,920
I wanna chunk out a few more good, I really like the CS calling though.

336
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
I'm gonna mark that one just for myself.

337
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Here's one that I wanted to hit you guys with.

338
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,120
20-bloodline-teen, there's power in your ancestry.

339
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Well, I think we could just do bloodline-teen.

340
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
I don't think you need the 20 in there, just bloodline-teen.

341
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,800
Bloodline-teen, there's power in your ancestry.

342
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,920
So you go back and you're like, there's power in there.

343
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,640
You know what I mean?

344
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
You're looking at your family tree,

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,720
there's some power in there that you've yet to unearth.

346
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Yeah.

347
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
Now, once again, I have to ask, Justin,

348
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,680
metaphorical power or literal power?

349
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,960
Well, no, Travis, you're not gonna find a fucking cross to kill vampires with.

350
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,520
You don't know?

351
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
It's not like a secret power, it's just like a power.

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
So what you're saying is just looking at an old piece of paper

353
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
with a bunch of names on it gives you power?

354
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,160
Yeah, I looked at Dad's 23 and me, he did.

355
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,600
There is no power.

356
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
We have no power.

357
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
There's no power in there.

358
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
It's not a good one.

359
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,000
What other words rhyme with nine, huh?

360
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
20-twine-teen, we all get really good at indie game development.

361
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
That could be great.

362
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,480
I think we're done.

363
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,040
I think we're done.

364
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,400
I think we need to pick from the list.

365
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
I think let's go through this and let's just get rid of the ones

366
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
that it's not going to be.

367
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,960
20-online-teen, the web is waiting.

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,560
Oh, shit.

369
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,360
Okay, wait, wait.

370
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,560
Fuck it, fuck it, flip it.

371
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,200
Offline-teen, unplug, renew.

372
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,480
Well, our business is the internet, Griffin.

373
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
I don't know that we would encourage our whole audience.

374
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,240
Offline-teen, except for my brother, my brother and me

375
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,320
and the adventurers, all of our podcasts.

376
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
All of our podcasts.

377
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,080
My friend and yours, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has come in with a late suggestion of 20-now-gene,

378
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,880
moisturize it.

379
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
It's very powerful.

380
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
He said to get sponsorship for that one.

381
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,920
He's a better writer than us, so maybe that is the best one.

382
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,420
Shit.

383
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,880
20-love-line-teen, bring it back with us in it.

384
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Yeah.

385
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
That's a subtitle.

386
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,480
I do, honestly, let me tell you why I like brine-teen.

387
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,200
The Sea is Calling, because we're already going to be going on the cruise,

388
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
so we've kind of built ourselves in a check mark.

389
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,880
But it's not...

390
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
These aren't for us, Trav.

391
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Okay, well.

392
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
They're not for us.

393
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
They are for us.

394
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
They're for everyone.

395
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,560
For everyone and us, mainly.

396
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,960
We need to make The Sea is Calling a bit broader.

397
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
We need to broaden our definitions, because there's people living in South Dakota

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
who listen to this podcast.

399
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
The Sea is so far away that it's not even close to the ocean.

400
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,800
You can't hear the whispers of the sea.

401
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,760
It's a metaphorical sea!

402
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
20 brine-teen, build a boat in your tub.

403
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
20 brine-teen, build an ark.

404
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,960
It could happen.

405
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,400
Two of each animal.

406
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,920
Justin, when you say the sea is metaphorical.

407
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,420
Yes.

408
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,960
Why are all of yours metaphorical?

409
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,440
All the things...

410
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,560
Because they're more powerful.

411
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
Metaphors are more powerful that way.

412
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,720
But because the sea is whatever it has kept you from achieving your goals.

413
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Whatever you're afraid of, whatever you don't want to delve into, it's calling you.

414
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
The sea is calling.

415
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,160
Adventure, new opportunities.

416
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,920
I don't know what's wasting the sea.

417
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,480
That's the...

418
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
No, Siri.

419
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, man.

420
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
I do not know what to make of that.

421
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
20 brine-teen, Siri is calling.

422
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,880
It's just you don't know what's out there in the sea.

423
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,320
You gotta get out there to find out.

424
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,040
I don't know what the sea wants with you.

425
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
I just know that it's calling.

426
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
Sure, sure.

427
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
I will go with this if this is what you want to go with.

428
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
But first, I want us to do a little exercise, okay?

429
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
Are you boys ready for this?

430
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,320
Yes.

431
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,760
Okay, we're gonna role play something, the three of us, and we're really gonna do it.

432
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,680
We're gonna start a new episode, and this will be episode...

433
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,920
Wow, like 492, 93, 490 maybe?

434
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,280
And it's a year from now, and we're trying to pick the 2020 theme,

435
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
and we're going back and sort of talking about the previous themes.

436
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,440
So let's just jump to that part, episode 490,

437
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
where we are talking about 20 brine-teen, the sea is calling,

438
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,760
a year later, just sort of figuring out if it was good or bad, and if we did it.

439
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay, hey, everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

440
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
brought to you by Burger King.

441
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,280
It's your one-stop shop for the latest and greatest in burgers.

442
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm gonna throw it over to my co-host, Jimmy Fallon, who's here with me.

443
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
Hey, guys, meet Jimmy Fallon.

444
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
Oh, it's 20 brine-teen.

445
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Well, to wrap it up, 20 brine-teen is almost done here.

446
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,760
The sea is calling.

447
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
Did we do it?

448
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
Jocotron is here.

449
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,640
Jocotron needs more blood to operate and create...

450
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,840
Oh, not again.

451
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
Now Jimmy Fallon's gotta murder someone else.

452
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Anyway, I've been Howard Stern.

453
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
That's all the episode we've got for today.

454
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,960
I got time to talk about the year those brothers came up with.

455
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
They called it 20 brine-teen, the sea is calling.

456
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
They were, of course, tragically killed at sea,

457
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,400
so that name has become extremely ironic now.

458
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,680
What do you think of name Annihilation Alien?

459
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,240
Whoa, because that really came true.

460
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,320
Definitely became true.

461
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
Okay, I'm gonna push back to 20 shine-teen.

462
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
Unbushel your candle.

463
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
I think it is...

464
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Here's my worry.

465
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,720
I think it is powerful, but I worry that it may be too generically powerful.

466
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,760
I don't know that we can necessarily harness that energy.

467
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm not sure the energy is specific enough with 20 shine-teen.

468
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,280
Because there's some people...

469
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,880
Hey, I don't know if you guys have been on the internet.

470
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
There's some people who I would like for them to keep their candle bright where it is.

471
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,120
Thank you.

472
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,400
I will say that is a worry that unbushel your candle

473
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,760
does have a bit of like entendre to it that I don't care for.

474
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
Get your pee pee out.

475
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,160
Yeah, Travis is right.

476
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,680
All right, 20 shine-teen is done.

477
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,600
I tell you, I really like refine-teen.

478
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
It's just the meter of it I don't like.

479
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,360
It's the, you know?

480
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
It's gotta be four syllables, I feel like.

481
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,280
Twine refine-teen, twine refine-teen.

482
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm not giving up on refine-teen.

483
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
It's just you gotta make it work phonetically.

484
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm not saying that I think...

485
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm not sure 20...

486
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I think the C is calling is good.

487
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,760
I don't think 20 brine-teen is extremely powerful.

488
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
It can't be another one.

489
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
It can't be 20 Kevin Klein-teen, the C is calling.

490
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,560
No, that's what it is exactly.

491
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,680
Now, could it?

492
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,480
It's Kevin Klein-teen, the C is calling.

493
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,200
It's Kevin Klein-teen, you gonna eat that pickle?

494
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
Kevin Klein-teen, the champagne of years.

495
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,200
Kevin Klein-teen...

496
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
It works with all these.

497
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
Kevin Klein-teen, destroy it from within.

498
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,880
Turpentine-teen, start it over.

499
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,560
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

500
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,240
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

501
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
We're just looking at rhyme zone.

502
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, rhyme zone, good call Griffin.

503
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,800
Now, we haven't done anything with swine-teen.

504
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
Pearls before swine-teen.

505
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
No one appreciates your art.

506
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
It seems like a wild thing to just...

507
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,480
That seems more like an observation than a goal.

508
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
We're getting further from it.

509
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
We're getting further from it.

510
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
And further from listenability, too.

511
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
What would you think about equine-teen?

512
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
This year we get a horse.

513
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
We're starting back over.

514
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
I like themes of renewal.

515
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
That's powerful to me.

516
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,280
There's just not many good words that rhyme with nine, I feel like.

517
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Strict-nine-teen.

518
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,240
No, come on.

519
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
We need to get fucking serious about this.

520
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
Oh, okay.

521
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Oh, what about this?

522
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay, are you ready for this?

523
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,320
Tagline-teen, that's the tagline.

524
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,880
The tagline-teen, that's the tagline is good.

525
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,360
And this would be like us taking a year off.

526
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,560
Yeah, kind of giving ourselves infallibility.

527
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,920
What do you think about this?

528
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
Fine-wine-teen, the champagne of years.

529
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,800
That does sound kind of like we're saying to have actual champagne,

530
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,520
which there are lots of people that may not be into that.

531
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,760
I think I'm becoming okay with refined-teen.

532
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
I just can't, the meter.

533
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,520
I can't do the meter.

534
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,520
What about wine-and-dine-teen, the champagne of years?

535
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,040
I don't want wine to be in it, I don't think.

536
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,760
Okay, okay.

537
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
Clandestine-teen, keep it quiet.

538
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,600
I feel like we do a lot of do bad,

539
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,280
like zigzag on them and do, you know, grifts.

540
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,880
I feel like maybe we should-

541
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Is this anything?

542
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
Genuine-teen, keep it real.

543
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
Genuine-teen.

544
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,800
Ooh.

545
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Genuine-teen, jump on it, my pony.

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,040
My saddle's waiting.

547
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,360
Come in, jump on it.

548
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,480
Built-in theme song, I like that of it.

549
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,160
Now, I'm just gonna say this out loud

550
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
so no one tweets it at me.

551
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,240
Sparkling wine-teen, the champagne of years.

552
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,040
Okay, yeah.

553
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,720
What we need to do, stop.

554
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
We're going at this backwards.

555
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,560
We need to figure out what do we want the message to be?

556
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,840
And then we'll work backwards from there.

557
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,760
What do we want people to actually do?

558
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,240
Because a lot of the time, I want to do a sort of new message.

559
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
I want it to be attainable.

560
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,000
I don't want it to be, you know, forward, move forward.

561
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,680
Like that shit is so, like people know to do that shit.

562
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
Okay, so what do you want to tell them?

563
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
That's what the three of us have to figure out, Travie.

564
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,440
We have told people something about heaven,

565
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,800
to get it, that's good.

566
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,320
Dig it up, get it out.

567
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
So they got it and then they dug it up

568
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,120
and then they moved on in 20 forward, right?

569
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,800
And then we step back with 20 grift-teen, the con is on.

570
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,760
So that was sort of like, you got it, you dug it up,

571
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,520
you moved on and you took what you learned to fool other people.

572
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,160
And then we felt bad about that in 2016.

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,080
So we decided to build some bridges

574
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
to get people back together.

575
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,040
But then while we were building the bridges,

576
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,480
we got a little too predictable.

577
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,640
So we had to zag on them, but then that was a little fishier.

578
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,800
So we're kind of got a rhythm and then starting together,

579
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
we're working together again.

580
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,040
So we conned, we built bridges, we zagged, we worked together.

581
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,160
So there's kind of a, so, and even going back to 2013,

582
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,880
we dug it up, got dirty and then 20 forward,

583
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
we moved forward with it.

584
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,040
So I feel like we do have sort of a rhythm of-

585
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,680
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,800
And we are due for like a more-

587
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,480
Uplifting?

588
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,640
Might I suggest more scrupulous-

589
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,160
Oh, we're due for a nasty one.

590
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,840
We're due for a nasty one, yes.

591
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,160
What about, because I just saw this one

592
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,200
and it gave me an idea, 20 divine-teen, the magic's in you.

593
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
The rhythm, the rhythm.

594
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,360
The rhythm's not good.

595
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,680
It has to be-

596
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,520
Divine-teen, fuck.

597
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,040
Yeah, it's the same as refined-teen.

598
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,640
It's the wrong rhythm.

599
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,440
You gotta have three syllables or one syllable

600
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,400
with a 20 in front of it.

601
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Okay, what about this?

602
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,080
Asinine-teen, get silly with it.

603
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,240
No, because the cursing in it.

604
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,720
Asinine isn't cursing.

605
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,040
But people will make it about the ass part, Travis.

606
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,960
You've been on the fucking internet, man.

607
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
You know how these people do it.

608
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
How about powerline-teen, eye to eye?

609
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
That was just for Travis.

610
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,160
A goofy movie one just for Travis.

611
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,280
Powerline-teen, like, amp it up, or powerline-teen.

612
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,640
That sounds like an energy drink, which I'm kinda into.

613
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
We are not gonna do any questions

614
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
this episode is starting to feel like,

615
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
and potentially no ads.

616
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,800
Whoops.

617
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
It's moving in that direction.

618
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,080
Should we just take the year off?

619
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
Should we just not do one this year?

620
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,640
What about Frankenstein-teen with a more powerful message,

621
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,160
such as, become unkillable, or Frankenstein-teen, fire bad.

622
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,040
That's useful.

623
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,720
Oh, what about Frankenstein-teen, become the monster.

624
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,680
And that one's less like, don't be afraid of the monster,

625
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,200
become the monster.

626
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,560
I kind of like that.

627
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,360
I think that's extraordinarily powerful.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,560
That is powerful, that really gets it.

629
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,520
I said it, I said it, but I don't know what it means.

630
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,440
And maybe we spend a year unpacking it,

631
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,680
but Frankenstein-teen, become the monster.

632
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,160
Become the monster is really working for me.

633
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
That is extremely good, Griffin.

634
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
It doesn't mean to do bad stuff.

635
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,000
No, no, no.

636
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,520
If you can't beat the monster, become the monster.

637
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,520
I think that's it, that's it.

638
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,040
Let's move, we got it, let's do it.

639
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
That's it, we got it in one,

640
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,160
and now it's time for a quick trick to the money zone.

641
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm so excited for the visual possibilities

642
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,480
of Frankenstein-teen.

643
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
Frankenstein's not trademarked, is he?

644
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,200
No.

645
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,120
Okay, so we got some sponsors?

646
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,000
Yes, no?

647
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just one, just one very special one.

648
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Yeah, let's all get a hand on this ball though,

649
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,240
because it's Stitch Fix.

650
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,240
A lot of people now just comment on any of our Instagrams,

651
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,680
just like, well, this picture is brought to you by Stitch Fix,

652
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,840
because we're almost always just head to toe, to bow to stern.

653
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,240
We sat around at Candle Nights in the backstage area,

654
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,000
like everyone there, like Stitch Fix, Stitch Fix, Stitch Fix?

655
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,800
Yeah, it was wild.

656
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,160
Oh, that's Stitch Fix.

657
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,000
It's an online personal styling service

658
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,080
that finds and delivers clothes, shoes, and accessories

659
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,560
to fit your body budget and lifestyle.

660
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,360
I've been using it for the better part of this year,

661
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
and I've almost completely changed my wardrobe,

662
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
and I dress much better.

663
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,920
I feel a lot better about the clothes that I wear.

664
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,160
If you don't like something they send you,

665
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,440
you just send it right back.

666
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
All the shipping is covered,

667
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
and their styling fee is just 20 bucks,

668
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
which is applied toward anything you keep from your shipment.

669
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,520
When you go to pay for it,

670
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,640
you can both rank the fit and the price,

671
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
and how well it matches your style,

672
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,480
and leave little comments, and they'll listen to that.

673
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
And it's not just shirts and pants.

674
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,640
I also get jackets in there, socks, shoes.

675
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
I've gotten some really great shoes out of my Stitch Fix boxes.

676
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,320
They sent me some Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

677
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,840
Really?

678
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,320
Yeah, I really needed them, but they fit my body.

679
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,160
That's amazing, Griffin.

680
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,120
Yeah, it was cool.

681
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,400

00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,120

That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

686
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,520
To get started today, one more time that address,

687
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,680
stitchfix.com slash my brother.

688
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,520
Beginning this summer,

689
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
you can listen to new episodes of Inside Pop

690
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,080
every other week for an even deeper dive

691
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,520
inside the world of pop culture.

692
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,560
Now we're still bringing you our brilliant insight,

693
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,080
always on the nose opinions,

694
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,000
and insider-y inside information

695
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
on the most interesting pop culture stories of the week.

696
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,720
And we'll also have interviews

697
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,320
with the pop culture professionals

698
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
who create the culture you crave.

699
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,240
For example, we'll speak to casting directors

700
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,120
about how they find the right talent for the right role.

701
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,640
We'll talk to music supervisors

702
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,760
about how they choose the music to create the right mood.

703
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
And we'll grill producers.

704
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,760
We'll discuss what exactly a producer does.

705
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh man, Sean, how many times has someone said to you,

706
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,200
oh, you're a producer, so what do you actually do?

707
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,000
So many times.

708
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,680
Same here.

709
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
So make sure to catch Inside Pop

710
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,640
every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun

711
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,360
to indulge your pop culture obsessions.

712
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,960
And to hear in-depth interviews

713
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,640
from the movers and the shakers

714
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
in TV, music, film, and more.

715
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
How about a question, Justin?

716
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,720
Our first question,

717
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
probably a good 35 minutes into the show.

718
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
Real quick, before we get to that,

719
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,960
I just wanted to,

720
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,360
we got a really important email here from Tyler

721
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,480
that I wanted to read.

722
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
Riddle me piss.

723
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,560
Tyler, you got me from Tyler.

724
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,480
Wait, is Tyler actually the name of the person

725
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,800
who submitted this riddle or did you just make up Tyler?

726
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
Tyler really did submit.

727
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
Oh, yes, Tyler submitted the riddle.

728
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
I like riddle me piss, Trav,

729
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,760
but the voice is what really kills it.

730
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,280
Riddle me piss, boys.

731
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah, piss boys is fun.

732
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,080
All right, I'm ready.

733
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
So, you're a math whiz.

734
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
You know, two nickels is 20 cents.

735
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
How much is 1000 Canadian pennies?

736
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
Yeah, this sounds more like the setup of a joke than-

737
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,360
There's a lot to unpack here.

738
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Yeah, because, yeah.

739
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,520
Because two nickels is not 20 cents.

740
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
Not 20 cents traditionally, mathematically,

741
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,360
using the sort of our math.

742
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,800
I also really enjoy a riddle that starts

743
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
with an aggressive chap.

744
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,480
So, you're a math whiz.

745
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,640
Yeah, I'm gonna say 1000 cents,

746
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
which I believe is $10 Canadian,

747
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,000
which I think means $10 Canadian,

748
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,840
I'm pretty sure is like 940 American.

749
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,560
Justin, do you have a solution?

750
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,240
Is it 10 Canadian dollars?

751
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,000
How much is 1000 Canadian pennies?

752
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520
Answer, nothing.

753
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
In Canada, pennies are worthless.

754
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,360
All right, so this is sort of a Canadian joke

755
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,680
about how they don't like their smallest form of currency,

756
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
which is, I think, sort of applicable everywhere.

757
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Like, I don't think much of the humble penny either,

758
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,640
but I don't know why you had to make it Canadian, Tyler.

759
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
Yeah, Tyler.

760
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
Tyler just emailed it to me.

761
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,480
Okay.

762
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,040
This is from riddlemaster555.

763
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,960
Gregory commented, pennies aren't worthless in Canada,

764
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
they just aren't produced anymore.

765
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,360
If anything, the alloy used to make them

766
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,680
is worth more than the monetary value of the penny.

767
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
So, yeah, it just completely takes your shit apart,

768
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,800
I feel like.

769
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,440
And, two nickels makes 10 cents.

770
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
You're thinking of dimes.

771
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,080
Dimes is, yeah, well,

772
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
I don't know what a Canadian nickel's worth.

773
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,640
Anyway, do you have any more riddles, riddlemaster?

774
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
Not today.

775
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,800
All right.

776
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm a 32-year-old very nerdy graphic designer,

777
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,600
and I live slash work in a co-op apartment building.

778
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,920
And there are many people of all ages living here,

779
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,520
including what has been described

780
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,840
as roving packs of teens.

781
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,200
The other day, I was in the elevator

782
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,560
with one of these so-called teens,

783
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,760
and they said I looked cool.

784
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,320
Man, I've never been cool my whole life.

785
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,840
If a teen says you look cool,

786
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
does that make you look cool?

787
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
That's from keeping it cool in Canada.

788
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
Oh, man, who was this teen?

789
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,240
I'll tell you what teens don't like.

790
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,400
I'm not gonna make a Fortnite or a vaping joke here,

791
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,160
because we've done about a thousand of those.

792
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,560
Although they do probably do like Fortnite.

793
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,600
They play it on their iPhone.

794
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,920
They are not complimenting people, though.

795
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,800
I've never seen a teen do a compliment.

796
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,560
I say that, there's probably nice teens out there

797
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,600
who watch nice Netflix movies,

798
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,040
like All the Boys I've Loved Before,

799
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,080
and the message is just be good to each other.

800
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,120
And so there are probably teens who are complimentary.

801
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,960
I've never seen one, I only see the ones

802
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
that do Heelys over my toes and crush my toes,

803
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,440
because they weren't paying attention.

804
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,840
Do the teens watch The Great British Baking Show?

805
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Do the kids watch that and then talk about it

806
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,880
at their lockers like, oh, that was the bad bake, huh?

807
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,080
Did you see that, Tyler?

808
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,360
What, the bad bake?

809
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,640
Oh yeah, I saw that.

810
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah, they don't call it baking, though.

811
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,920
They call it yeast blasting.

812
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
Did the teens, did the teen when they said it,

813
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,320
were they like, huh, you look cool, like that?

814
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,040
Because that might have been, maybe it was like pejorative.

815
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
There's a lot of variables here, yeah.

816
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,160
The tone of voice, you look cool.

817
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,200
Did they say like, you look cool,

818
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,160
like a cool person that would buy teens alcohol?

819
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,840
Oh yeah, did they maybe say, hey, are you cool?

820
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,280
Are you cool?

821
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,960
Do you know how to party, or do you party?

822
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,160
You look cool, do you party?

823
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,440
Are you cool?

824
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,800
Are you a cool cop?

825
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,600
Are you a cool cop?

826
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,720
Hey, hey, you look, can I say something?

827
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
You look weed.

828
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,040
Yeah, and then another variable here

829
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
is how cool did the teen look?

830
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,840
Because if it was a real fucking poindexter saying,

831
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
it just means you're cooler than them,

832
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,200
which is probably still pretty low.

833
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,680
The teens are bringing back styles from the 90s.

834
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I don't know if you guys keep up with teen fashion.

835
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
It's back.

836
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,200
Always.

837
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,080
So the nice thing is, if you don't update your shit,

838
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,240
eventually you're gonna circle back around,

839
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
and you will have a window.

840
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,680
You may just be in your window right now.

841
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,960
Like, Friends is back.

842
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,360
Like, Hygiene's are back.

843
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Yeah, Hygiene is back.

844
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,200
Were you wearing like a Ross sweater?

845
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
Because that might have done it.

846
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,960
Yeah, did you look like a real Ross?

847
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Did you look like a real Ross?

848
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,440
Real Ross.

849
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
If they're cool, if they said you're cool,

850
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,160
you don't look like Ross, all right?

851
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,640
You look like Joey.

852
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,080
You look like a Phoebe?

853
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,360
Oh, a Joey.

854
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,280
A Phoebe, the coolest friend?

855
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,920
Yes, for sure.

856
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
I think it's all backwards though now,

857
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,080
because I think the kids like Ross.

858
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
I think the kids are just crazy about Ross Geller.

859
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,080
No.

860
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,320
No.

861
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,800
No, Griffin, there is no generation

862
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,040
that will ever be into Ross Geller.

863
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,520
That's fair.

864
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,760
He was an impotent clown joke.

865
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

866
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,520
Don't tweet at me about friends.

867
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,080
Listen.

868
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,960
Please.

869
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,920
Please don't.

870
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,120
I won't appreciate it.

871
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
I don't enjoy the program.

872
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,840
Don't tweet at me about friends.

873
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,040
Don't.

874
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,400
It's important.

875
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,160
Here is a Yahoo sent in by Nathan Smith.

876
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,880
Thank you, Nathan.

877
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,720
It's Yahoo Answers user Nathan,

878
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480
which is maybe just an unfortunate coincidence.

879
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,680
The question's from 2010,

880
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,240
so I don't think this is Nathan.

881
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,400
I wrote this great Yahoo eight years ago.

882
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
Okay, well, let's help Nathan out.

883
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,040
This is the first time we've ever been able to get

884
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,600
real hands-on help from the source.

885
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:37,920
Yeah.

886
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,880
From the source.

887
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,760
Nathan asks,

888
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,680
how can I get sponsored for parkour?

889
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Okay, I've been training parkour for six months,

890
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
14 hours a day.

891
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,680
No, I can do anything anyone wants me to do.

892
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,320
For example, I just accomplished a quad kong vault

893
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,280
outside the other day.

894
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
No way.

895
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,600
No fucking way, bruh.

896
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,280
Nah, dude.

897
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,560
It's one of the hardest tricks ever.

898
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,240
I take this profession very seriously,

899
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,480
and push myself to the best of my abilities every day.

900
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,560
Real quick, there's a lot more,

901
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,200
but real quick,

902
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,360
can you even quantify the hardest parkour trick?

903
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,640
It seems like you can always do more flips off a building.

904
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,680
Do you know what I mean?

905
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,200
It's a higher building, more flips.

906
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,080
What happens, Griffin,

907
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,760
is someone does a flip off the building,

908
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
and their legs explode.

909
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
And then you just take that back one flip.

910
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,080
But then you get stronger legs.

911
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,600
Anyway, trying to create-

912
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,200
Real quick, quad kong vault,

913
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,120
just so we have some context here.

914
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,200
Imagine four obstacles in front of you, right?

915
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Like four-

916
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,840
Like hurdles?

917
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,040
Yeah, four hurdles, right?

918
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,040
My depression.

919
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,880
My sort of self-destructive-

920
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,080
Your uprising, yeah.

921
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,040
My upright, yeah.

922
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,880
So upbringing, there's the word.

923
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,080
So it's like, you jump up in the air,

924
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,200
you land on the first obstacle on your hands,

925
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,720
and without really losing momentum,

926
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,640
you jump, you land on each of the four obstacles

927
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,520
with your hands.

928
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,000
So like-

929
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,720
Okay.

930
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,120
It's-

931
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,240
So you don't use your feet?

932
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,320
No.

933
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,560
I mean, you use your feet to get it going,

934
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
to get sort of it rolling.

935
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,400
Is it faster than walking?

936
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,640
I mean, if you got a good head of steam,

937
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,000
it would be faster than walking.

938
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,400
But that's-

939
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,600
I have big strong hands.

940
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,560
Oh, I'm watching it.

941
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,640
I just saw someone do it without their feet.

942
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,520
Yeah, this is good.

943
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,960
Hey guys, can I ask another question?

944
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,760
Did parkour-

945
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,800
Is this just sort of an evolved version of

946
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,080
the Monty Python Department of Silly Walking,

947
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,040
if you think about it?

948
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,560
But hard?

949
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,600
Like they were doing that,

950
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,480
but then they did it hard,

951
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
and they're like, this is sports now.

952
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,720
We got Justin-

953
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,120
We got here just in time to make parkour jokes.

954
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,000
They're not gonna fly in 2019.

955
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,640
All right, yeah.

956
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,800
No, because there's not gonna be room to breathe

957
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,440
what with all the vegetable jokes I'm gonna be making.

958
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,360
So I only went to a park-

959
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,080
Please let me finish.

960
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,960
Please let me finish.

961
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,600
Uh-huh.

962
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,360
I only went to a parkour gym once,

963
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,520
then decided to learn parkour on YouTube carefully

964
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,120
and was successful about it.

965
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,520
I would like to-

966
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,200
Well, thank God for the carefully part.

967
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,680
For sure.

968
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
I would like to get sponsored and go pro-

969
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,560
My name, it's Parkour Jim.

970
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,560
I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know.

971
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,920
I'm not going for the money,

972
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,760
but wanting to go for the experience

973
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,360
and meet new people to learn new moves

974
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,640
and bring my skill to the next level.

975
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,760
Please give me a legit website

976
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,800
and I will be deeply grateful.

977
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
Have a great Christmas day for whoever celebrates it.

978
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,600
That's good that these sort of progressive there at the end.

979
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,640
So, hmm.

980
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,480
I wanna do a trick with my body over a fire hydrant.

981
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,320
So good that Taco Bell gives me a hundred thousand dollars.

982
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,200
As long as I wear a sticker on my parkour pants.

983
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm gonna share a link here in the chat

984
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,480
for the perfect website this person needs to go to.

985
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
Okay, what's that, Travie?

986
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,960
And keep in mind that they can't-

987
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
Okay, holy shit, Trav, you're the best brother

988
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360
and best comedian of all time.

989
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,240
Travis is maybe the greatest comedic mind of all time

990
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,160
and I feel like nobody really appreciates.

991
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,560
I mean, Travis has his fans for sure,

992
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,080
but I don't think anybody really understands

993
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,000
the true depth of your genius.

994
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
Thank you very much, Kevin.

995
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
So go ahead and say what the parkour sponsorship would be, Trav.

996
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,320
Parquet.

997
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,600
Yeah, the butter.

998
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,680
I'm gonna get-

999
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,440
And we should maybe give people a chance

1000
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,320
to really groove on it, really ride the wave.

1001
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,520
It comes in spread sticks and squeeze and spray bottles,

1002
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,160
if you're wondering.

1003
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm looking at the website now, parquet.com.

1004
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,760
Don't give it away for,

1005
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,320
don't give the milk away for free, you silly cow.

1006
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,520
You gotta hold on to it.

1007
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
And don't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1008
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,280
So you gotta go to the parquet factory and start-

1009
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,440
I'm looking to see if there's any kind of contact form.

1010
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,280
Oh, there is contact us?

1011
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,040
The parquet factory is going to have

1012
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,400
a giant industrial strength churner in there somewhere.

1013
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,680
You have to stunt.

1014
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,080
You gotta Kong flip all the fuck the way

1015
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,360
over that fucking thing.

1016
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,960
You gotta get, and people be scared.

1017
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
He's gonna fall in and become butter,

1018
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,120
but you don't because of your abilities.

1019
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,520
And then-

1020
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
It's gotta be slippery in there, they'll say.

1021
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,720
Oh, shit.

1022
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,440
Go in the parquet factory with your own butter in your pocket,

1023
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,480
spread it on the floor, slip, break your skull.

1024
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,720
Then parquet's gonna have to do a settlement for you

1025
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,080
and give you millions of dollars.

1026
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,960
And at the end of the day,

1027
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,120
you can say that's a sort of sponsorship.

1028
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,000
There you go.

1029
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,400
Or, ooh, spread out some of that competitive brand X butter

1030
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
and then spread out some parquet butter

1031
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,680
and see how easy it is to do it on the brand X butter

1032
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,880
because it's not slippery at all.

1033
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,360
And then try to do parkour on parquet and you're like,

1034
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,360
ah, this butter is the slipperiest.

1035
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, for sure.

1036
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:33,760
That's good.

1037
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,280
We're done.

1038
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,560
My friend and I are on vacation in Ireland for the holidays.

1039
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,600
An old man at a bar and they've written here pub,

1040
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,120
I guess, because they're in Ireland.

1041
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,880
Like, yeah, we get it.

1042
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,560
No, that was an auto-cracked by Irish Google.

1043
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,880
It's Irish Clippy.

1044
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,960
You be trying to type a bar here in the Emerald Isle.

1045
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,680
Travis, you're closer to him.

1046
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,880
Swat his nose to the newspaper.

1047
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,120
I'm trying to get him, but he's in West Virginia.

1048
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,160
Just sit around, so the old man at the bar,

1049
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,000
just sent a round of beers over to our table

1050
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,600
and wished us a Merry Christmas.

1051
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,560
We were about to leave.

1052
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,760
What do we do?

1053
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,920
We're planning on drinking the beers.

1054
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,800
Good start.

1055
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,720
But we don't know if we're supposed to buy him

1056
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,840
and his friends around now.

1057
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,920
How do we leave this pub without seeming like ungrateful tourists?

1058
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,760
That's from Gifted in Guinness in Galway.

1059
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,600
Amp this to amp this shit up.

1060
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,800
I have only had a round bought for me once at a bar.

1061
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
I've only seen it done once and it was at

1062
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
my 10-year high school reunion.

1063
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,040
So that even escalated even more,

1064
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,760
because I got even more skin in the game here.

1065
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,640
The party who did buy the drinks did go around

1066
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,480
making sure everybody did get their drink,

1067
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,640
which is maybe a new way of doing this

1068
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,320
that is, I don't know, you could consider successful.

1069
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,240
What is the etiquette here for a round of brewskis?

1070
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,600
Here's what needs to happen.

1071
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,280
Bars need to start carrying incrementally larger glasses.

1072
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,120
So it's like, okay, you sent over like one pint.

1073
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm gonna send back 1.1 pint of beer.

1074
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,040
Okay.

1075
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,520
Right?

1076
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,880
So it's like an investment.

1077
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,800
So it's like, I bought you a round.

1078
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,320
Oh, it paid off, right?

1079
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,800
My investment paid off and now I'm getting a return

1080
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,240
on the beer that I bought you.

1081
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,760
But if it doesn't come back, you're like,

1082
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,280
oh, well, another bad stock.

1083
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,000
I didn't choose well on that one.

1084
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,040
You go, you take your mug or pint glass, I guess,

1085
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,840
of beer up to the bar and you say, hi, I have this

1086
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,920
and I'm gonna be back later.

1087
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,120
Can you put a lid on it and put it behind the counter for me?

1088
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,280
And then I'll be back later to please save this for me

1089
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,960
and put a lid on it or something and I'll just come back.

1090
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
So it doesn't get stinky.

1091
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,120
So it doesn't get skunked and I'll come back later and drink it.

1092
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,640
Now, how does that help in getting a beer back to this old man?

1093
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,600
Yeah, that's the question.

1094
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,760
Do you, I feel like a round is such a selfless act.

1095
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,400
When you buy a round, if there's like 30 people in the bar,

1096
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,000
you're not expecting 29 other people to then do rounds.

1097
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,840
That would be a, that would take, first of all,

1098
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,440
that would take four and a half days

1099
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,120
and no one would survive it.

1100
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,000
That's so much.

1101
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,800
And no one says like drinks are on me and then you.

1102
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,320
And then you do it for me.

1103
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,200
It's not a fucking like massage circle that you're doing

1104
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,640
on opening night of your community theater production.

1105
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,320
It's, you know, it's a pub.

1106
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,680
It's a pub, it's a pub.

1107
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,400
I think that this is a very pay it forward kind of thing

1108
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,080
where like maybe next Christmas,

1109
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,520
you're at a bar parentheses pub in parentheses

1110
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,800
and you buy a round for a table and you say Merry Christmas

1111
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
and somewhere that old man feels the warmth in his heart.

1112
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,680
Oh no, it's a heart attack.

1113
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,320
I mean, the other thing here is you were about to leave

1114
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,400
and when the three of us used to go out to like,

1115
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,880
you know, bar things after shows

1116
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,160
and people would buy us drinks and shots,

1117
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,760
I had to get good at saying, I don't want that.

1118
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,040
I don't want, people would buy me a shot of like scotch

1119
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,240
or some shit and I'd be like, I do not want that.

1120
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,920
Put that, here's a shot of gin.

1121
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,280
I don't want to have that.

1122
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,960
So no, but thank you.

1123
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,000
Not even thank you.

1124
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,360
What were you thinking?

1125
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,120
Of course not, of course not.

1126
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,080
Must be tough.

1127
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah, no one's ever bought me anything in my life.

1128
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,880
Yeah, I've had to work and scrape for every inch.

1129
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,440
For every shot of scotch.

1130
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,600
I don't think they do shots of scotch, do they?

1131
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,960
I don't know much about alcohol.

1132
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
Here's a question, what did he want?

1133
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
What's this guy's angle?

1134
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,720
You think he's running for mayor.

1135
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
That's gotta be it.

1136
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,040
It's gotta be it.

1137
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,520
Probably that.

1138
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,840
I have a sort of unique thing here.

1139
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Somebody sent in what I thought was Yahoo

1140
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,440
and I looked at it and I was like, oh, this is great.

1141
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
And then I realized it's actually a Reddit.

1142
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,000
Is it okay?

1143
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:55,680
Sure.

1144
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,560
It's pretty powerful.

1145
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,360
Become the monster.

1146
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,400
Let's become the monster.

1147
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,400
I think participating in Reddit is about as on the nose

1148
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,240
of becoming the monster as I can think of.

1149
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,360
This is from Desitroso.

1150
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,120
Actually, it was sent in by Michelle Smith.

1151
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,760
Thank you, Michelle.

1152
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,240
By Reddit user Desitroso or something like that.

1153
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,760
They ask, and this is in the guitar subreddit.

1154
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,400
I got Taco Bell in my guitar and IDK what to do.

1155
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,960
I got Taco Bell in my guitar and IDK what to do.

1156
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,920
I was eating Taco Bell nachos and like an idiot,

1157
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,920
I was eating them over my guitar.

1158
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,760
As I was going for a bite out of a chip,

1159
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,320
the beans fell and ended up right in my guitar saddle

1160
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,440
underneath the strings.

1161
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,200
While trying to get it out with a napkin,

1162
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,040
I just spread it around and screwed it up.

1163
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,080
How do I fix this and get it out?

1164
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,120
The brown stuff?

1165
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,680
It is, some of it is really deep in the saddle

1166
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,200
and I can't even see it anymore.

1167
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,600
Will it affect the guitar at all or attract bugs?

1168
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,040
Pulls help, I just wanted Taco Bell and this is my main guitar.

1169
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,040
The fear is not that you can't get the beans out of your guitar.

1170
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,400
The fear is that you play the guitar

1171
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,800
and you're better than you've ever been

1172
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
and then you become overly dependent

1173
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,960
on beans in your guitar.

1174
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,440
Oh, right, right, right.

1175
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,680
It's a rock and roll story, isn't it, of addiction?

1176
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,960
It's the tale of oldest time.

1177
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,800
Oldest rock and roll story there is.

1178
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
You get beans in the guitar.

1179
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,040
Give me the beans.

1180
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,600
I've already brought you so many beans to eat.

1181
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,640
I need more beans.

1182
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,680
I need more beans.

1183
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,200
That's why they call me Beanie Ray Vaughn

1184
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,680
because I love to put beans in there before I play.

1185
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,040
Jimmy Beandrix.

1186
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,240
Yeah, Jimmy Beandrix love to rub beans all over it.

1187
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,640
Hey, could you not, when you go to Taco Bell,

1188
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,040
I imagine you didn't have your guitar with you.

1189
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,640
This didn't happen at the restaurant.

1190
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,640
You brought the Taco Bell home,

1191
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,040
putting on a guitar while holding a Taco Bell.

1192
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,920
Like what was the chain?

1193
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,760
I cannot imagine a chain of events

1194
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,680
that would lead me to eating Taco Bell

1195
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,880
with my six strings strapped around my back.

1196
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,720
I can't-

1197
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,320
Okay, jam sash slash lunch down.

1198
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,840
I can't, you can't do both at once.

1199
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,200
First of all, the strings of a guitar

1200
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,000
after one minute of playing them become stinky

1201
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,760
and smell like robot armpits.

1202
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,760
So like I would not want that on my nacho sort of materials.

1203
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,840
It just seems like you shouldn't do both of these.

1204
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,160
And this is a punishment and it's never gonna come out.

1205
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,720
And people are gonna look at your guitar saddle

1206
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,880
and say like, hey, is that beans?

1207
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
And what a goofball.

1208
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,880
And you have to accept it that you are a goofball.

1209
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,560
There's no way you're gonna get

1210
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,600
these fucking beans out there.

1211
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,400
They're forever.

1212
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,920
These beans are gonna outlive you.

1213
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,560
Could you take it to like, I don't know,

1214
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,920
a pawn shop or something and tell them

1215
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,720
that this is a like, you know, a Van Hengen style

1216
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,280
you know, Van Halen bean variation version of this guitar

1217
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,840
because Van Halen always ate beans while they played

1218
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,640
and see if you can sell it for more money than it's worth

1219
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,920
and really con them.

1220
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,760
Yeah, pawn shop owners are so fucking stupid.

1221
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,160
You can get one over on So Easy.

1222
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,960
One time I took in a bunch of Nintendo 64 games

1223
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,200
and I said that they are Freddie Prinze Jr's

1224
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,880
and they gave me like a hundred bucks.

1225
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,380
Whoa.

1226
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,380
Oh, yeah.

1227
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,940
I mean, a hose, just blast it.

1228
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,220
Just blast it with a hose is one option

1229
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,100
that Griffin came up with.

1230
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,580
Soak it in a bathtub.

1231
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,340
What about a dirty toothbrush?

1232
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,100
It's good to keep an old toothbrush around

1233
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,860
because it's perfect to clean stuff like this up.

1234
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:35,380
Yeah.

1235
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,820
Use your dad's toothbrush to clean the beans out of your car.

1236
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,140
We almost always had a dirty toothbrush lying around

1237
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,740
that we could use to clean things with.

1238
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,820
And this was in the home we grew up in.

1239
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,060
Since then, I've never had an old toothbrush,

1240
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,100
an old dirty toothbrush,

1241
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,300
because I think the act of,

1242
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,780
there's an act of just defilement

1243
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,940
that you have to do to an active toothbrush

1244
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,780
in order to get a dirty cleaning toothbrush.

1245
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,100
Yes.

1246
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,020
And I've never been bold enough to pull the trigger on that.

1247
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,060
Nice thing about Quip.

1248
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,340
You're gonna have a lot of these lying around.

1249
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,100
Every three months, you're gonna get a new cleaning tool.

1250
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,140
It's not like you're getting a new brush.

1251
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,180
Hey, they didn't pay Justin enough about Quip.

1252
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,740
Fuck Quip.

1253
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:11,540
All right.

1254
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,260
We're gonna use a brand-ech toothbrush.

1255
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,380
So that's gonna do it for us here in our,

1256
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,260
maybe last episode of Collaborate Team,

1257
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,220
maybe first episode.

1258
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,820
Let's just call it first episode,

1259
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,180
because we have kicked off the year.

1260
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,100
Basically, I'm not gonna adhere to the calendar.

1261
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,780
It begins when we say it begins,

1262
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,980
and it has begun now.

1263
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,180
Frankenstein Team, become the monster.

1264
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,140
So welcome to that.

1265
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,860
I'm sure we'll have some merch at mcrorymerch.com

1266
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,660
coming up real soon for that to celebrate.

1267
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,500
Please don't put it on Redbubble.

1268
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,260
Just give us a fucking second, please.

1269
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,820
Give us a fucking second, please.

1270
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,980
One of us needs to go to lawyer school online.

1271
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,220
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1272
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:51,940
for these for our theme song.

1273
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,260
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1274
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,140
It's a very good album.

1275
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,820
It's a very good song,

1276
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,340
and it's a powerful way to start out the show,

1277
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,020
and it gets me going every time I hear it.

1278
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,140
Go to mcrory.family.

1279
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:08,580
We're gonna be in New Orleans and Birmingham in February.

1280
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,660
You can get yourself some tickets.

1281
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,700
Come to those shows.

1282
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,660
Hang out with us.

1283
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,220
You can find links for that on our website,

1284
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,500
and come see us, and it'll be exciting.

1285
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:20,900
I'm excited.

1286
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,340
I've never been to New Orleans before.

1287
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,380
I'm excited.

1288
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,700
I mean, I've never been to Birmingham either,

1289
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,500
so I'm excited about that.

1290
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,020
So just go to mcrory.family, click on tours.

1291
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,460
Get yourself some tickets.

1292
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,300
That's God's country, Birmingham.

1293
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,540
And New Orleans.

1294
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,420
I mean, all of the earth is God's country.

1295
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,420
That's why he protects us from the aliens.

1296
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,060
What else?

1297
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,140
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1298
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,260
Go to MaximumFun.org.

1299
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,460
Check out all the great shows there.

1300
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,140
Shows like the JV Club with Janet Varney,

1301
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,300
newcomer to the network,

1302
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,900
and shows like the Beef and Dairy Network,

1303
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,860
and Friendly Fire, and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org.

1304
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,660
Hey, quick plug.

1305
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
On the last Sawbones episode we did,

1306
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,620
we recorded it live at Cannon Knights in Huntington,

1307
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,260
and we've done some that's a Christmas to me bits on the show.

1308
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,820
And it is a full Hallmark film that Sydney and I wrote,

1309
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,260
and everybody in our family basically performed in it.

1310
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,020
So if you've-

1311
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,340
It's extremely, it is so fucking funny.

1312
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,140
It's really funny.

1313
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,020
You guys killed it.

1314
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,820
It is so good.

1315
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,460
Thank you, guys.

1316
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:25,860
Thank you.

1317
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,140
Let's wrap it up.

1318
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,180
Genuinely touched by that.

1319
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:28,580
Thank you.

1320
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,980
I don't feel like you're becoming monsters,

1321
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,860
but that's fine.

1322
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,660
We're not in it yet.

1323
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:32,900
Okay, so-

1324
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,180
We love monsters.

1325
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,660
Okay.

1326
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,420
So Merit Palmer sent this one in.

1327
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:36,900
Thank you, Merit.

1328
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,980
It's Yahoo Answers user Sasha who asks,

1329
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,140
I ate an old Lifesaver candy cherry flavor.

1330
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,300
Will I die from the oldness of the candy?

1331
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:45,780
Please help.

1332
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,380
My name is Justin McElroy.

1333
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,820
I'm Travis McElroy.

1334
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1335
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,660
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1336
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,540
Kiss your dad.

1337
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:12,820
Let's go way around the lips.

1338
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,740
Maximumfun.org.

1339
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,780
Comedy and culture.

1340
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,900
Artist-owned.

1341
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,940
Listener-supported.

1342
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:24,020
We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

1343
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,540
You drink a little too much.

1344
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,820
You don't actually read the book.

1345
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,860
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

1346
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,380
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

1347
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,740
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

1348
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,900
We do not require guac.

1349
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,860
We require only nutrients and expansion.

1350
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,580
You will become book club.

1351
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,140
You will eat, pray and love with us.

1352
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,580
Join book club.
