1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:02,560
Good evening. Please be seated. I gotta say thank you to my team.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,280
And I want to say thank you to everyone who worked so hard on this campaign, this effort.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,160
It felt like me, Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother, wasn't even like one entity because

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,680
our hearts had merged. But as we all know, it was looking good there in the beginning,

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:32,960
but things started to change colors, which is confusing to me. And so I am afraid I am here

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,880
tonight to concede my presidential bid. And I wanted to say out there, I love my wife and God

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,640
and my son, my kid. And I just, I worked so hard, but off beans, it didn't happen this time around.

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Mr. McElroy, Travis McElroy of the Travis McElroy Monthly.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah.

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,360
What party were you running with? I didn't hear a lot about your campaign.

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
Party rock, party rock, party rock anthem.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,720
The party rock anthem party, or is it just called party rock anthem?

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,840
Have you heard the song? It's not called party, it's not called party rock anthem party, is it?

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
So your political party was the song?

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Next question, this is next question.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Yeah, you're promised to send every American-

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm sorry, please introduce yourself.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Oh, hi, this is Justin McElroy from Quibi. You said that you were going to

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
send every American family 100,000, and I have it here in my notes. Hold on one second.

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,040
I'm rubbing two Great Wolf Lodge gift cards together.

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,280
Right. 100,000 smaccaroonies, you said.

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
Sure. Yeah, I was surprised that people didn't give me more votes for that,

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,840
because that's a considerable sum of money. And I listened to the words of my good,

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,320
dear friend, Andrew Yang, because you know me. I'm fucking deep in the Yang gang and the cane train.

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,040
So those were sort of my guiding lights. And he was like, let's give everybody a basic

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,600
income. And I was like, let's give everybody 100,000 American dollars.

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
A follow up question, Travis McElroy, Space Camp.

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,440
Yeah.

35
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,240
Were you actually going to ever do that?

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,960
Next question.

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I was going to stop war. I wasn't planning on doing war.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
Yeah, you said you weren't planning on doing war anymore.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah, I didn't want to. I thought about it for a while and I get it.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:47,520
You know, you see Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, Avatar, The Last Airbender by M.I.

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Shyamalan. You see all these military flicks and you're like, fuck yes! Call of Duty,

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
another big one for me.

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
More like Call of Duty.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah, you see those and you're like, fuck yes! But then you think about it and you're like,

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,840
it's really just a lot of sort of people hurting. So I wasn't going to do that one.

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,960
Apparently, I thought that was another hot ticket item.

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,120
But, hi, Steve Kurnacki here, MSNBC.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
Hi, hi.

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,520
I've been moving some of these numbers around and I have, hold on.

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Yeah.

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,760
OK, yes. This is if you look up here where Griffin's opponent,

52
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,080
Mr. Peanut, currently has 50,000 votes and Griffin had eight.

53
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
But if you look at these percentages, the rate these ballots are coming in,

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Griffin, I think there's every chance you are going to pull through with a

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
very viable performance here against Mr. Peanut.

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,640
And let me tell you, regardless of how this goes, I'm going to take this.

57
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,520
Uh-huh, wait.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm going to take, I'm going to-

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,920
Sorry. OK, go, say it again. OK.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
That was my producer. I'm sorry. I was actually getting some incorrect information.

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
It's actually down to seven now.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh, he lost a vote.

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
You lost one vote. You didn't pick up a bunch. You actually lost one.

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
Like I was saying before you interrupted me, a political guy.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
So think about that.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,880
I was saying I'm going to take this case to the extreme court,

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
which is the next, which is the one higher up.

68
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
Here he goes.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,520
Now that's the one where you and Mr. Peanut are going to shred against each other, right?

70
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah. Can we get this guy the fuck out of here?

71
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Hi, Travis McElroy, different Travis McElroy.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,760
He's a ba- I'm going to take this to the extreme court because he's a fucking baby.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm sorry for cussing. I know I'm on MSNBC, CBS, and all the big ones, but he's a baby.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Is the extreme court the one where all disputes are settled

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
via foam jousting rods like in American Gladiators?

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes, and then we have to do the wipeout course.

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,160
Now I made a joke like that and you kicked me out of your press conference.

78
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Well, because you phrased it wrong.

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Oh, fuck. Sorry I cursed. I know we're on MSNBC.

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,120
Yeah, we're on TV. I think that one's not going to win me any Rust Belt votes.

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Now, sorry, Travis McElroy, third Travis McElroy.

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah.

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Now that you have conceded, would you accept another position in the administration?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Well, I didn't quite concede, did I? I didn't say it, did I?

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Oh. Do you concede?

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,920
A little mystery.

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,360
Yeah, so-

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Oh, that makes you very intriguing.

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Now I think you're very attractive because of this mystery you've created.

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,040
And I'll tell you-

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Hi, excuse me. Yes, excuse me, Justin McElroy.

93
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
You're interrupting the political guy again, so think about that.

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
Sorry, I am attempting to abstract this bit so it doesn't become so pointed

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,200
as to become in poor taste on Monday,

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,280
since we have no idea if Monday will ever come at this point.

97
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah, at this junction.

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
At this particular junction.

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Now I have just Travis McElroy interrupting Justin McElroy,

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
interrupting the political guy.

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Yeah.

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,400
Candidate Griffin, do you think that the gargoyles of the gargoyle cartoon

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,800
fit into the whole of the fighting mutant animals with abs genre,

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,440
or are they a separate kind of entity?

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,320
Well, if you read my policy platform, you would know that I do categorize

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,600
the gargoyles right alongside the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,520
and the samurai pizza cats, so-

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Do you include the biker mice from Mars

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
and the mighty ducks in there, sir?

110
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Go to my website.

111
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
Go to my website, which I won't say out loud,

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,600
because that means Justin will have to buy another website,

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,200
but go to my website and you'll see where I stand

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
on Big Bad Beetleborgs, VR Trooper-

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,520
Uh, Cowboys that Move Mesa.

116
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,080
Yes.

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,840
Excuse me, I, excuse me, Justin McElroy is my brother.

118
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,280
My name is Travis McElroy.

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,520
Whoa.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
I don't know much about pot.

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
What is the Rust Belt?

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm really embarrassed to ask.

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
Right, right.

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,920
So there was a long time ago.

125
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm so glad you asked this question.

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm so fucking glad you asked this.

127
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,280
What's your name, old guy?

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
Are you asking me my name?

129
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah, what's your name?

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
It's Travis McElroy.

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,080
My brother, Justin McElroy, of course, knows what the Rust Belt is,

132
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,440
but I didn't know, so I won't ask.

133
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
You won't tell me.

134
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,040
This is such a smart little question, little guy.

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,320
And I'm proud of you for asking it.

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm a lawyer, so please don't talk down to me.

137
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
Okay, so anyway, back in the day,

138
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,000
there was a few states that did a lot of blacksmithing,

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
but it rained, didn't it?

140
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,800
What states would you say those were, sir?

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,080
The upper ones.

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
The upper ones.

143
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Mr. Vacheroy, if you could just name some of the states

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,960
in that Rust Belt, I'd love to hear.

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,160
I feel pretty certain Michigan,

146
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,440
but Michigan is on the border of the country.

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
It's on the border of the country,

148
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
so what kind of belt could that be?

149
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
That's not a belt, that's a hat at that point.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
It's a rust hat, and I guess it doesn't sound as good.

151
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
If it's a belt, it's gotta be in the middle.

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
That's why Florida is called the dick shoe.

153
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
And that's great, Bible Belt, that makes sense,

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
because it's a belt around the pants of our Florida penis.

155
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Yep, and that's why California is called the fanny pack.

156
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
It's right there on the hip, it's where it fits in.

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,240
And that's why we call it the Dakotas and Iowa,

158
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
that's the bread bowl.

159
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Do you think it's embarrassing?

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
You could just eat that, you could eat that right up

161
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
when you're done with your soups.

162
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,960
Hi, another McElroy brother here.

163
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
Do you think it's embarrassing?

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,880
What?

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,840
Which one?

166
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,240
Gillip.

167
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,360
Hi, Gillip McElroy, do you think it's embarrassing

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
that apparently Charleston, West Virginia,

169
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,960
which is just 40 miles from our hometown,

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
is apparently part of the Rust Belt,

171
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,000
and you were not aware of this fact?

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Do you find that embarrassing?

173
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Wait, just Charleston though, not Huntington?

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,480
No, no, no, no.

175
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Oh, we didn't make it.

176
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
You have to have had production at one point.

177
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,520
Ah, okay.

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Well, I did not say it wasn't.

179
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,800
So I do concede, and I'm done, but catch me out there

180
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,920
on the trail.

181
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,720
You're retreating to your original campaign slogan,

182
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
which was, I did not say it wasn't McElroy 2020.

183
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Exactly.

184
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,160
I don't like the idea of it just being separate towns,

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
uh, like, sprinkled around,

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
because that sounds like rust freckles.

187
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Sure.

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm just saying these two fucking guys are up there,

189
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
like, rah!

190
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
No, you, rah!

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
And I'm over here, like, chilling.

192
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
So I guess where do you want to,

193
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
where is your loyalties lie?

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,600
My name is Griffin McElroy.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
I approve this message.

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
I unconcede.

197
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,400
Come and get it.

198
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh.

199
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,920
Come and get it.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,800
That's the new slogan.

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Come and get it.

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
You're $100,000.

203
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm going to take all the healthcare away.

204
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,120
All the healthcare is going to go away,

205
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,760
but guess what?

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm also going to get rid of all illness.

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Wow.

208
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
Everyone will be invulnerable.

209
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,800
Hi, uh, Travis McElroy, Travis McElroy Monthly.

210
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,040
Go ahead.

211
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,960
I've decided to throw my hat in the ring,

212
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
and now I'm running too.

213
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,280
Get on up here then.

214
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,920
Get on up here.

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,640
Okay, thank you.

216
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
All right, excuse me.

217
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,400
Hold on, I'm getting on stage.

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm a political guy now and you can't interrupt me.

219
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
You can't talk to us political guys like that.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
And now as a political guy,

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm willing to give every American family $1 million

222
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,760
Whoa, that's so much more than me.

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,840
If they can find me.

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
Oh, yeah.

225
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Rat race.

226
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,080
I've given you all the clues.

227
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
This guy rules.

228
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
Now you'll have to find me.

229
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Second place gets a Jelly Belly factory that I do not own.

230
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,360
All right.

231
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Third place, big smooch.

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh, but now the momentum's gone, I feel like.

233
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
Well, depends on how much you value a smooch.

234
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
So right now, I guess Justin,

235
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
you're the only person in the room.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Vote.

237
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,600
Hey, excuse me.

238
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
My name's Roger Dinkins.

239
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
I built that stage.

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
Oh, it's not rated for two people.

241
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,040
You gotta get off.

242
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,680
Oh, no.

243
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,160
Oh, God.

244
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
Oh, God, no.

245
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
It's taking so long.

246
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, no.

247
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Why did we build the stage so tall?

248
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,080
Oh, God, almighty and heaven of Jesus, no.

249
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
You're falling on me.

250
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm ruined.

251
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
What a whoopsie, right?

252
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,080
Did you guys ever see Kelsey Grammer did one of those?

253
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Oh, yeah.

254
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,440
Oh, yeah.

255
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,840
That's my new-

256
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,400
I don't think he collapsed the stage to bring a Niles crane up on the-

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,760
No, that actually is what happened.

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
He fell off the stage and then he was so angry he smashed it.

259
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
My new policy platform I think I'm gonna run with in 2024.

260
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
2022, I could do a Senate one.

261
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,320
Is that one time that Kelsey Grammer fell off the stage.

262
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,240
I refuse to let this degrade our great institution of my brother, my brother, me any longer.

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
You guys ever thought about doing a Senate?

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
I've thought about doing a Senate.

265
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm not talking about politics anymore.

266
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
I think I'd be a good Senator.

267
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,240
I have to prove to myself that my brain can process information that is not about politics

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,480
currently.

269
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,520
Probably not gonna.

270
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,880
For reference, my friends, try to flashback as you're listening to this to Friday, November

271
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,040
6th at 2 51 p.m.

272
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
Here's how distracted we are by what is happening in this world right now.

273
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,720
We did-

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,480
You are listening to this after Travis and my birthday that we shared.

275
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Aw, shit.

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
We did not make the opener about that.

277
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,840
And now it's too late.

278
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
No, we're still special birthday boys though, right?

279
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,560
No, we're not.

280
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,800
Fuck!

281
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
We talked about politics and we fucked up.

282
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,520
All right.

283
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,840
Fuck!

284
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,720
Yep.

285
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,600
And I was- and I was turning 29.

286
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
And I'm-

287
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,640
Wink!

288
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,520
23.

289
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,840
Wink!

290
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
Wink wink!

291
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm eight.

292
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Whoa.

293
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,160
Give me all your jelly beans.

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,840
Can ice has jelly beans, mister?

295
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,880
Okay, recently while my roommate was away for the weekend, I executed a crafting endeavor

296
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,600
which required me to stick my recently purchased silicone kitchen tongs into a melted Bath and

297
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
Body Works candle.

298
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,200
I washed them afterwards and put them back where they belong.

299
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,120
A few days later when my roommate was back, I made some dinner for the two of us using

300
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
the tongs and the entire meal tasted faintly of this candle.

301
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,480
Whoops!

302
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
Whoops-a-do.

303
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
I don't think my roommate noticed, otherwise he would have said something.

304
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm at a crossroads.

305
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,960
Do I tell my roommate about what happened and replace the brand new tongs?

306
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,320
Or do I keep them and continue to have my meals taste like mahogany coconut?

307
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
That's some shameful champagne.

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,400
What's wrong with you?

309
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,880
This fucking rules because I'm imagining this is a sort of performance art where it's like,

310
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
hey, has anybody seen my NutriBullet?

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
Has anybody seen my Slap Chop?

312
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,320
I really don't want to mess with these onions right now.

313
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,200
And you can be like, oh, that?

314
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,600
I did dip it in Gak for art.

315
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,160
Mm-hmm.

316
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,720
Yep.

317
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,760
Now you don't have it.

318
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,400
I miss it.

319
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,960
I know.

320
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
And that's an emotion.

321
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
So technically we did art.

322
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,640
Question asker, you've given us very limited information about the project you are working on.

323
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,000
All we really know is, and I'm going to use this word with quotation marks around it,

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,200
it required you to dip your tongs into a candle?

325
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,400
Not doing that wasn't an option.

326
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
Had to be done.

327
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,080
So what were the following steps?

328
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,880
Did you put something in the candle you were trying to retrieve?

329
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Or was this like a, you know, when you stick your hands in something?

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,080
No, they were dipping something into the wax to coat it in wax.

331
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,600
And they were getting it out with the tongs, because they didn't plan ahead.

332
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,640
And I know what that's like.

333
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,400
I know what that's like.

334
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,840
Seems like a bad idea.

335
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
I've done this project before.

336
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,280
I used my silicone, you know, a rubber brush.

337
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,240
Which one is it?

338
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
We don't know.

339
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
A rubber basting brush to spread wood glue.

340
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
It's a great way of spreading wood glue around because it peels right off.

341
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,680
But that's the only one I had, and I had to spread some butter on it.

342
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
Delicious something.

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,240
And I was a little bit embarrassed because it was the one that I had used to spread wood glue.

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
But it was fine.

345
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,200
Wait, how was it fine?

346
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
Because here I am.

347
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
That's not fine, Justin.

348
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
Hey, here I am.

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,680
Some of his inside parts are pretty stuck together.

350
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
I got a few miles on the odometer.

351
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm not going to lie to them.

352
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm doing fine.

353
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
So if you're listening to this, I made it to 40 probably.

354
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,360
How about that?

355
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
So your point about being fine is that you're still kicking.

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,680
And so...

357
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,360
Baby, I'm kicking.

358
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm punching.

359
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,640
I'm doing everything.

360
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,240
Age is just a number.

361
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
It's not going to slow me down.

362
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
Age isn't just a number.

363
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,280
Just to point out, it's the amount of time you've been on earth.

364
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
It's counting something.

365
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,920
It's not just a number.

366
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,240
I'm worried, Juice, more about in the future if you have to have an appendectomy or something

367
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
like that and the doctor's got you open and it's like,

368
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
oh, there's that little naughty boy.

369
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
And they go to pull it out and it's like,

370
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,720
oh, fuck, this thing's glued to his ribs.

371
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,760
Where's the appendix?

372
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,240
Nobody knows.

373
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Yeah, it's glued to the ribs.

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,040
It is now.

375
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,400
They pull it out and it kind of sproing back in.

376
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah.

377
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
Do you want a yahoo?

378
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,680
I'd love that.

379
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Well, what to do with these tongs?

380
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
Put them in heat.

381
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,920
Throw these tongs away.

382
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,240
You're never going to get this.

383
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,280
Don't throw these tongs away.

384
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,760
Save these.

385
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
These are craft tongs.

386
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
Yeah, these are your art tongs now.

387
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,680
They're art tongs.

388
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,320
Put them aside.

389
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,200
Get some new tongs.

390
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
Get a new pair of tongs as a present for your roommate with a little ribbon on it.

391
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
And they'll say, why did you do this?

392
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
You don't want to know the answer to that question, but just appreciate it.

393
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Hey, listen, you can't do what Justin just said because it'll make it sound like you

394
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,520
use the old tongs for a sex thing.

395
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
We don't know.

396
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,840
They're using candle wax.

397
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,680
We don't know that it wasn't a sex thing.

398
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,640
This is absolutely true.

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
But if you say to your roommate, I'm sorry, you can't use the tongs anymore and I can't

400
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
tell you why, they're not going to be like, dip them in a candle, huh?

401
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,560
They'll assume the worst, yeah.

402
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,360
I guess you could, like, you can use them for grilling corn, but it is also a sort of

403
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
makeshift speculum situation.

404
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,840
No more food applique.

405
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah.

406
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,720
No more.

407
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,520
Get new tongs.

408
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,560
Those are craft tongs now.

409
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,200
Do you guys, I think this is a pretty universal thing.

410
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,880
We had, for about an hour and a half, two pairs of scissors and one was, I don't know

411
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,640
how to put this, but like, not raw meat scissors and the other ones was raw meat scissors.

412
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,240
But we got those and I was all stoked and I put them in the scissors drawer and then

413
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,280
the first time that I needed to open a packet of bacon, the raw meat scissors were gone.

414
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,720
And I was like, well, non-raw meat scissors, today you will be baptized in pig fat.

415
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
And I'm so, so sorry.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
I don't want to brag, I got three pairs of scissors.

417
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,360
I got raw meat scissors, I have normal kitchen scissors, and then I got the sharp boys.

418
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh yeah.

419
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,280
Oh, when you need the sharp and you need that clean zip.

420
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't you hate when you see your kids using the sharp boys for crafts and cutting paper?

421
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,680
Please don't do that, that's for chicken.

422
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
No, them's my sharp boys.

423
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,400
We got this question sent in by so many people and it's not the, it's weird because it's

424
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
not usually the kind of question we do.

425
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,000
It's almost a, this is almost a backdoor riddle me piss.

426
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
So yeah, I know Travis would be excited.

427
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,280
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, Riley, who asks, how to fill a water bed quickly

428
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,920
and then in parentheses, no hose.

429
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh, okay.

430
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Ooh, all right, the situation, my roommate is currently out of town for the weekend and

431
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
is visit, whoa, weird.

432
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,920
Isn't that how the last actual question started?

433
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,080
Yes, I have a pair of tongs and a candle.

434
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,640
What can I do?

435
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
My roommate is visiting her family for her birthday.

436
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
As a thoughtful gesture, I thought I would get her a used water bed for her birthday

437
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
as she stated several times that she wants one.

438
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
The thing I failed to realize, however, when purchasing the behemoth queen size water bed

439
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
is that it doesn't come prefilled.

440
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,560
I am now stuck, I'm now stuck with a large plastic sack sitting on my living room floor.

441
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,520
My roommate is coming back in two days and I have no idea how I'm going to get this awful

442
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
mistake filled before she gets home.

443
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
How do I mend this terrible soggy situation?

444
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
Do I explain it to her and live with the shame of my aquatic misery or is there another solution?

445
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
This almost sounds like I'm a bim bam question.

446
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
The answer is obvious.

447
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,920
With no hose, no hose, no hose, no hose.

448
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,520
I know you're going to buy a second water bed that's full, tape them together and then

449
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,720
jump on the full one so that it fills the empty one.

450
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:18,960
Boom.

451
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,440
That's good.

452
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,200
Okay.

453
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
Next question now.

454
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
It's not bad actually.

455
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,320
You take it.

456
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
But can I ask you a question?

457
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:27,840
Yeah.

458
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
About practicality.

459
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,040
Uh-huh.

460
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,280
What's wrong?

461
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,880
Well, Tariff.

462
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,120
Yeah?

463
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Once you've bought, excuse me, once you bought a full water bed.

464
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,800
To why the job is done.

466
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,680
No.

467
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,920
No.

468
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,560
Because the one you bought-

469
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,800
If this person knew where to buy full water beds, they probably would have done that.

470
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,800
The one you bought isn't cool.

471
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,040
Well, no, the one that they bought was used, right?

472
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,480
And so they got that for a song.

473
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,680
If they got a full water bed from one of these big box water bed stores, they could take

474
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,400
it to their house.

475
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,240
They paid an arm and a leg for it.

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
They really just need the water.

477
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,240
Yeah.

478
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,760
So they do the sort of blood transfusion and then they bring back a wadded up

479
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,120
empty garbage bag of a bed and they say, I don't want this anymore.

480
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,480
And they'll say, what happened to all the water that was in it?

481
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,080
And you say-

482
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
You say evaporated.

483
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,680
You say desert band, you say desert bandits.

484
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:27,920
Yep.

485
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:28,800
They fucking got me again.

486
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Can I just say that if I bought Mad Max Desert Bandits-

487
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Mad Max Desert Bandits came to my house, drank up all my damn water bed.

488
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,680
I witnessed them.

489
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,000
Yep.

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,640
I saw it.

491
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,120
Wasn't enough?

492
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,800
My own two dry eyes.

493
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,160
I just want to say if I bought a used water bed and it came with used water, that would

494
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
be probably the worst.

495
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
Because I don't know what that water has seen or heard.

496
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,440
Well, water, can't see or hear anything.

497
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
And I feel like it's-

498
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,160
There's microbes in water, they know.

499
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,200
We're not gonna do that.

500
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Have you played Spores?

501
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
Water does not have a memory, no matter what Frozen 2 told you.

502
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
Fucking Olaf says it does.

503
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
So, but it is waterproof and that goes both ways, Trav.

504
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
So that water is not coming out.

505
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,160
If you do, you could do the nastiest, jizziest sort of scenario on there.

506
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Whoa.

507
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,120
And it's not gonna get in the water bed.

508
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
So water bed water is fine.

509
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,080
Once it's in there, it's fine.

510
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,080
That is a good way to store water for the apocalypse, if you think about it.

511
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,080
If you think about it-

512
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,320
Make sure to stare eye, I'll put it in there.

513
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,080
That'll last you a couple days at least.

514
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Yeah, so I think-

515
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,720
That wasn't a joke.

516
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
That's just a prepper tip from me to you.

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah, thank you.

518
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,080
Oh God, with this stuff.

519
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,160
I'm just saying keep rice on hand, but keep it in small bags so that raiders don't know

520
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,440
how much rice you got.

521
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
Those fucking desert bandits.

522
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
If they see your big barrel of rice, they're gonna know that they need to steal from you.

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,960
Maybe they're gonna see that bed and their eyes are gonna go blue.

524
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
They're gonna go wild for your bed.

525
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
Maybe just fill that water bed with some rice.

526
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,840
Oh, two water beds, one with water, another one with poison water.

527
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
Oh, that's good.

528
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,240
And the ban-

529
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,920
I guess you could just have one with poison water, as long as you don't drink.

530
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,560
Ah, man.

531
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,960
Well, here's another question.

532
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,040
While grocery shopping with my mom, I started feeling chilly from the blast of fall AC.

533
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,440
I remarked how jokingly that I could go to the clothing aisle and wear a jacket for the

534
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,800
rest of our shopping trip.

535
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
She looked at me offended and chided me for this idea.

536
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,240
But the more we discussed it, the more I started to think it was a genuinely good solution

537
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
to my chattering teeth.

538
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,640
Her arguments were, I raised you better, you don't know who else wore it, and it's dishonest.

539
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
Brothers, when things are safer, would it be acceptable for me to wear a jacket without

540
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
the intent of purchasing it?

541
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,920
Was my mother right to dissuade me?

542
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,000
That's from Shivering Sister in Florida.

543
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
God, I gotta think on this one.

544
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,920
Okay, this is-

545
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,560
I like this-

546
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,160
You're just springing right into it.

547
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,880
This is like, it's so rare that we- apologies get a good question, and I really need to

548
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,600
think on this one.

549
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,560
Well, what I like, the reason I'm jumping into it is the mother has presented three

550
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,200
counter-arguments that I feel like we can discuss.

551
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,040
And right off the bat, let's start with number one.

552
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,240
I raised you better.

553
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,120
Clearly not.

554
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,760
No, you didn't.

555
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,320
Yeah, clearly not.

556
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
Proof's in the pudding.

557
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,080
Okay.

558
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
Second one, someone else could have worn it.

559
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Now, I can't deny that, but what are the odds because it's still hanging up in the store?

560
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

561
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,840
I mean, could is the operative word here, and I think this argument has to stand.

562
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
Someone else could have worn it.

563
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
But that's true of my jacket hanging in my closet right now.

564
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,920
Exactly.

565
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,880
Correct, yes.

566
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,800
So we will dismiss it on those grounds.

567
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,520
Okay.

568
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,040
Finally, it's dishonest.

569
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,680
Now, this is the nut, isn't it?

570
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,960
Mm-hmm.

571
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,680
I cracked open this white chocolate M&M, and here's the nut inside.

572
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,120
It's not, though.

573
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,560
It's not.

574
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,800
You're not hiding it.

575
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,320
I used to really, really wrestle with this because we all have those little demons.

576
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,040
We all have our-

577
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,720
Our dark passengers.

578
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,840
Our little, just our little imps and pixies riding around inside of our mind trying to

579
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,920
make us do stuff that we don't want to do.

580
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,200
And sometimes, you know, when I was younger and at the grocery store, and, you know,

581
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
I was peckish or really, really thirsty.

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,960
That's a big one.

583
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
And I'm in the checkout aisle, and there's just Diet Mountain Dew right there.

584
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,480
So I'm going to crack it open, even though I haven't legally bought it yet.

585
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,680
I would never do that, even though it's probably just fine.

586
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,120
But now I feel like that's not a concern of mine because back when we, you know, we're

587
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
going to the grocery store with our child as like a fun family activity, we'd roll up

588
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,240
in a Trader Joe's, and I would just grab me some pumpkin jojos and just rip them and grip

589
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
them, baby.

590
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,920
Start feeding them whole fistfuls into me and my son's face.

591
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
Okay, but here's the difference, though, Griffin.

592
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,920
If you open a drink and start drinking it, you have irreparably used up some of that.

593
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,000
If I put a jacket on and then take it off, I used up nothing.

594
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,120
I'm saying it's fine.

595
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm saying it's fucking totally fine.

596
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Do you know how many times-

597
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,760
I used to exclusively buy my clothes at Target through all of college.

598
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,600
And that's not a judgment, but it is a fact that I went to Target many, many times wearing

599
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,560
Target clothes.

600
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
And nobody fucking called the cops on me.

601
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
Fucking Isaac Mizrahi didn't kick the door in like, fucking drop it.

602
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,800
Like, it didn't happen.

603
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,840
Those are my sweats.

604
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,600
There's a bubble.

605
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,840
There's a bubble where you can try clothes on and it's within three feet of the, you

606
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,960
know, the hanging place, which sounds more ghoulish now that I've said it like that.

607
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,280
And within like three feet of the dressing rooms.

608
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,480
And other than that, you can't.

609
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,560
You can't just take it for a test driver or walk out.

610
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,640
Why not, Justin?

611
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,920
Because it's not a fucking library.

612
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,840
You can't take a coat out for a spin around the store.

613
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,880
That's shoplifting.

614
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,840
You're using it for the primary utility that it is intended for.

615
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
If you're using it to warm your body, you are stealing.

616
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,080
Oh, so if I go to Best Buy and I stand in front of one of the TVs and watch a scene

617
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
from Mr. Deeds, I'm stealing?

618
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
Because I'm using the TV for its intended purpose?

619
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't believe that you can-

620
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,680
Because stealing, it has to be some-

621
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,760
I'm saying that with something physical, right?

622
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,040
It's physical.

623
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,080
You're stealing it.

624
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
And now actually my argument's falling apart.

625
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,080
Hold on.

626
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I gotta think about this.

627
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,680
Think about it.

628
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,120
The Mr. Deeds thing was actually very good.

629
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,240
It was really good.

630
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm saying if I pick up the coat, if I pick up the jacket-

631
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,160
Yes, it is stealing.

632
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,760
If you enjoy Mr. Deeds on a TV that happens in front of Best Buy,

633
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,000
you have stolen the joy that you should be paying Mr. Sandler for.

634
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,800
So that's a trap.

635
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
That's entrapment is what you're saying.

636
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,560
Mr. Sandler's films operate on a sort of scarcity commercial sort of scheme

637
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,840
where you are spending money to fill the Mr. Deeds gap in your life.

638
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,360
And when you do that for free in the technology aisle of your store,

639
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,080
then that need no longer exists in Mr. Sandler.

640
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,720
You're robbing.

641
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,280
You're fucking robbing him at gunpoint.

642
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,400
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

643
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,440
I pick up the jacket, I put it in the cart.

644
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,640
That's fine.

645
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
I pick up the jacket, I put it on my body.

646
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
That's not okay?

647
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,360
Correct, because that's stealing.

648
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,920
That's shopping.

649
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,600
No, you know what that is?

650
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,680
That's preconceived notions, my friend.

651
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
And I'm here to break those down.

652
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
Let me ask you a question, Trav.

653
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,640
You've worked in the loss prevention field, correct?

654
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
Yes, I have.

655
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,240
Okay.

656
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,120
If you worked at a jacket store and you watched someone put on a jacket

657
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,280
and then kind of walk away from where that was,

658
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
what would you think they were doing?

659
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
I would think they were stealing, Justin,

660
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,080
but I have preconceived notions is what I'm saying.

661
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,160
I would look at them and I'd be like, oh, that person's stealing.

662
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,880
But you know what?

663
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
This is what I learned in loss prevention.

664
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,640
I wouldn't do anything until they attempted to leave

665
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,680
through the doors with said jacket on.

666
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,600
See, that is what I would do accidentally.

667
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
And I really can't introduce to my life the more possibilities

668
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
that I will accidentally do a crime,

669
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,280
because it is something I think about a good amount.

670
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,200
Don't want to open the door to that.

672
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,640
That is my number one fear in life is that I will accidentally murder someone

673
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,800
because I watched too many episodes of CSI.

674
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,480
God, I would hate doing that.

675
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,800
Right?

676
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,600
Can you imagine how embarrassed you would be if someone saw

677
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,280
and they were like, hey, did you just kill that guy?

678
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,160
And you're like, oh, oh, shit, I did.

679
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,600
Oh, man.

680
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,400
What is this?

681
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
This is arsenic?

682
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,800
I thought it was coffee mate.

683
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,440
Shoot.

684
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
Oh, beans.

685
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,720
You're not going to tell anybody, are you?

686
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,280
We're going to keep this between us, right?

687
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
I think this is the official ruling of all three of us on this podcast.

688
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,160
It's all good as long as there's no BO, dude.

689
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,200
I think that this is a Schrodinger's cat scenario.

690
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,280
It's fine unless you are observed.

691
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
And then it is wrong.

692
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
I'm just saying do a-

693
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
That's all shoplifting.

694
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,720
No.

695
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,400
But it's all fine.

696
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
It's all fine.

697
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,880
Oh.

698
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
It's all fine as long as there's no BO, dude.

699
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,240
Nobody thinks they have it.

700
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,000
Just check it.

701
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,360
Everybody thinks it's fine in there.

702
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
Check the jacket.

703
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,520
Check yourself.

704
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,440
Before you wreck yourself.

705
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
And it's fine to wear it when you're cold.

706
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
As long as there's no BO, dude.

707
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
But that's actually what it says on all the signage in Target.

708
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,160
Yep.

709
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,560
Check out these mugs.

710
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,480
As long as there's no BO, dude.

711
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
Now it's a crime to go to the pharmacy section.

712
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,880
And get some old spice pure sport.

713
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,760
Rub that in there.

714
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
And then you come back to the jacket section.

715
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,840
And the store clerk's like, what are you doing?

716
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,760
Oh, nice.

717
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,600
No BO, dude.

718
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
Take it for a spin, baby.

719
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,880
And then you climb into a tent.

720
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
And you spend the night in Target.

721
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,360
Okay, Travis.

722
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,080
I was about to go to the money zone.

723
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm not going to let this go.

724
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
I want to get some quick hits from you.

725
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

726
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,800
I want to walk through Target with you virtually.

727
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,040
Okay.

728
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
And are you seriously saying that you-

729
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,720
Whoa, it's like I'm there.

730
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,040
I know.

731
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,960
Are you seriously saying that it's not a problem, this coat action?

732
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,000
You would not have a problem with you yourself believing yourself doing this.

733
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh, what?

734
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,360
Wearing the coat?

735
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,840
Yeah.

736
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

737
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,760
Uh-uh.

738
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,480
No.

739
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
Stop it.

740
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
If I'm cold, would I put on the coat?

741
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,920
Yes.

742
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,420
Yeah.

743
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,720
If I was going to buy it, yeah.

744
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,680
Okay.

745
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,160
That's absolutely not germane to this question.

746
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,640
But that's not saying, Justin, there are many things that I'm not comfortable with myself.

747
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
But that's what we're discussing.

748
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,200
That doesn't make them crimes.

749
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,800
You're saying that someone walking up to a table in a restaurant

750
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,120
and playing live music in my face should be illegal

751
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
because I'm not comfortable with it.

752
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,960
I missed it.

753
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,840
I missed it.

754
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,440
Are they buying the jacket or not?

755
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,840
They're just using it while they're in the store.

756
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,680
Without the intent of purchasing it.

757
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
Oh, well, then no.

758
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,640
Then fucking, oh, I switched it and flip it.

759
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,880
No.

760
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,200
Obviously, I feel like I've been whistling dog songs here.

761
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,760
Come on.

762
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,000
I've just, I've been trying to free myself from my own preconceived notions

763
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
and misconceptions to say, what difference does it make

764
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,280
if you're cold and you put on the jacket and you put it back?

765
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,760
It is obviously wrong and illegal.

766
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
But the difference is not that we're not talking about legality.

767
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
We're talking about mores.

768
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,680
And it's the only thing that's holding us together as a people at this point.

769
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,600
Honestly, everything else has failed us.

770
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,320
We have to be able to agree on some things.

771
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,640
If this show has a theme, you know, if this show is about something,

772
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,320
it's about the fact that there have to be things we can agree on, okay?

773
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,400
Just as a society.

774
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,360
This isn't okay.

775
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,800
Come on.

776
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,520
You know what?

777
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,240
It's not okay.

778
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
That's what your mom should have said.

779
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,200
Your mom should have let go of those first three arguments

780
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,640
and then just looked at you and said, you know this isn't okay.

781
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,680
You know it's not okay.

782
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,080
I mean, I'm coming back to the other side though.

783
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,800
Fuck!

784
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,640
No, but listen, but listen, listen, listen.

785
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay.

786
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Target's gonna be fine.

787
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,120
And I know that Target isn't like, you know, I'll wear a Hobby Lobby jacket

788
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,680
and get my fucking reek all over that and put it right back on the shelf.

789
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,360
I'll dump it in the potty and then I'll put it back on the shelf.

790
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,280
Because I'm fucking, I'm a rude dude.

791
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,280
Yeah, but Target, it wouldn't be mean to Target.

792
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,680
I have no emotions to Target.

793
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,520
I just have the emotion of cold.

794
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,600
And so I would wear it and I would steal it.

795
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,800
I would watch a little bit of Mr. Deeds and then I would put it back

796
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,360
and I would tell somebody that I did this bad thing

797
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
but they can't really do much about it.

798
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,120
And then I would leave and guess what?

799
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,400
Target's gonna be just fine.

800
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,640
Target's gonna be fine.

801
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,920
The question is not, does it have ramifications?

802
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,560
The question is not, what are the long-term effects of doing it, Griffin?

803
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,080
Of course, Target's gonna be fine.

804
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You wore a jacket for 10 minutes.

805
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,680
Of course, they're gonna be fine.

806
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,880
The question, here's what the real question should be.

807
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
Not is it evil or good or anything like that?

808
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,680
But can we all agree that there's an invisible boundary saying not to do it?

809
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,760
Much like if you walked past a party that was having a buffet,

810
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,640
of course there's nothing wrong walking in and going and eating a piece,

811
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,680
like a sandwich and leaving.

812
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,160
You wouldn't be arrested for that.

813
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,240
But we all know you should not do that

814
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,760
because you weren't invited to the party.

815
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
Yeah, but it's kind of fucking punk rock to wear this jacket.

816
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm coming around hard.

817
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm like way on the other side now.

818
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,880
Wear a jacket.

819
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,080
So it's a protest wear.

820
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,880
Throw on some fucking board shorts while you're at it

821
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,080
and give those a spin.

822
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,480
Maybe toss on some-

823
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,400
No, nothing below the belt.

824
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Come on, Griffin.

825
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
Nothing below the belt.

826
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,080
I mean, over your pants.

827
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh, okay.

828
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,200
That's fine.

829
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,480
That's a good look.

830
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,920
Y'all remember that look where we'd wear sort of shorts over sweatpants

831
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,440
and people would look at us and be like,

832
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,080
that's a guy going to play basketball later and it's like, no.

833
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,640
I do, also, as long as we're talking about looks that we miss,

834
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,200
I miss the Gutenberg crop top sweatshirt.

835
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,320
Oh, God.

836
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
Man, can we bring that back?

837
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
I used to do a reverse look

838
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
where I would wear gym shorts under sweatpants

839
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
so I wouldn't have to change for gym.

840
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,640
Oh, we all did that.

841
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Okay, good.

842
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
That's why I took individual dual sports

843
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,760
so I wouldn't work up that reek.

844
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,400
I would do like an evil Steve Gutenberg crop top

845
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,920
where it just covered my belly,

846
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,600
but like my chest and shoulders were fully exposed.

847
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,720
How?

848
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,920
It just, it was more or less just a big shirt belt

849
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,600
that wrapped around my belly,

850
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,640
but then you could see like my nipples and armpits and everything.

851
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,120
Oh.

852
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,920
And people liked that.

853
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,120
People liked that about me.

854
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,600
They did.

855
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,920
They did.

856
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,400
They did.

857
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
You know what I like about you?

858
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,000
What, Justin?

859
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,120
You're good at reading ad copy.

860
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
That's categorically not true.

861
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,320
Let's prove it and head on over to the blog.

862
00:35:48,320 --> 00:36:00,080
Let's head over to the Money Center.

863
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,880
Thank God for the US Postal Service.

864
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,040
They're keeping everything,

865
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
trying to keep everything together.

866
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,120
It's tough to go to the post office though physically,

867
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,400
not only with like the, you know, the stuff going around.

868
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Some of the unpleasantness happening,

869
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,920
but also, you know, you get busy.

870
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,720
It's crowded.

871
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
Yep.

872
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,840
I love to get busy.

873
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,920
Time to get busy over at Stamps.com.

874
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,120
Mailing is going to be super popular here in the holiday season,

875
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,760
and you can stay ahead of all the crowds.

876
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
Just use your computer to print official US postage 24-7

877
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,200
for any letter, any package, any class of mail,

878
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,800
anywhere you want to send it.

879
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,080
Once your mail is ready,

880
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,240
you schedule a pickup or drop it off.

881
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,520
It's that simple.

882
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,720
You'll save some cash on your shipping,

883
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,960
and it's just a great way to utilize this great institution.

884
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,200
So don't spend a minute of your holiday season

885
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,480
at the post office this year.

886
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,080
Sign up for Stamps.com.

887
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,600
Instead, there's no risk with my promo code, MyBrother.

888
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,000
That's right.

889
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
I said my promo code, MyBrother.

890
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,560
Oh!

891
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,280
Private one.

892
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,960
You get a special offer that includes a four-week trial

893
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
plus free postage in a digital scale.

894

No long-term commitments or contracts.

895
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,840
Just go to Stamps.com.

896
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
Click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

897
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,120
and enter MyBrother.

898
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
That's Stamps.com.

899
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,760
Enter MyBrother.

900
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
Stamps.com?

901
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,120
Never go to the post office again.

902
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,880
Wish you guys hate more.

903
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
Enter MyBrother or slash MyBrother.

904
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,520
They're both the words to say, right?

905
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,720
I think I hate Enter MyBrother more.

906
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Enter MyBrother is so bad to say.

907
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,120
Slash MyBrother at least sounds like maybe

908
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,320
MyBrother could fight back.

909
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,280
Yeah.

910
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,240
Yeah.

911
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,000
I guess it's true.

912
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,000
You guys naked or what?

913
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Hawthorne's next up on the chopping block.

914
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,360
It's actually not next up, Griffin.

915
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
Next up was Stitch Fix.

916
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
And if you say Hawthorne is next up,

917
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
it makes Justin saying,

918
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
are you guys naked really weird?

919
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
And it was already really weird,

920
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,080
but saying like,

921
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,440
yeah, Justin said we're naked.

922
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,320
Anyways, here's a premium tailored personal care for you.

923
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,080
Do you guys have your dicks out?

924
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
Because I want to talk about toothbrushes.

925
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,120
All right.

926
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,880
Well, I guess Travis do the other.

927
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,120
Okay, so Stitch Fix.

928
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,440
Yeah.

929
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
Listen, look down at your shirt.

930
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
That's a dumb shirt.

931
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,640
Unless you got it from Stitch Fix.

932
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,640
Then it's good.

933
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,920
Then it's a good shirt.

934
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,240
Yeah.

935
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,840
So look at those pants.

936
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,560
They're okay.

937
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,080
But are they Stitch Fix pants?

938
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
If they are, nice.

939
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,200
Stitch Fix offers clothing hand selected by expert stylist

940
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,360
for your unique size, style, and budget.

941
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,280
That budget one is one of my favorites

942
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
because you can go there and be like,

943
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,240
hey, I would never pay more than like blank for a t-shirt.

944
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,480
And they're like, yeah, you got it, dude.

945
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,200
Here's a cool t-shirt for the price you set.

946
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,600
And you can try those pieces on at home before you buy.

947
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,440
Keep your favorites, send the rest back.

948
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,120
So if you get some cool Stitch Fix pants

949
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,520
and you're like, these Stitch Fix pants are too cool for me.

I love Stitch Fix.

955
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,640
I am wearing Stitch Fix right now pretty much all the time

956
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,360
at this point.

957
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,880
It's nice to have grownups that dress me

958
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
and give me good clothes to wear

959
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,840
instead of the dumb, dumb clothes I was wearing.

960
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,120

970
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,720
Do you guys have combo home and car insurance?

971
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,560
So today I'm gonna talk about Hawthorne.

972
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,840
They make bathroom stuff.

973
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,920
They make bathroom stuff

974
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
that's gonna give you a right pretty stink.

975
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,520
And it's all kinds of stuff.

976
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,440
Anything that you have in your bathroom,

977
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,800
look around your bathroom right now.

978
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
Everybody, give me a second.

979
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
Oh, mm, nice.

980
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Do you have any Hawthorne stuff in there, Trev?

981
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,120
I got this good smelling Hawthorne stuff.

982
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,080
Okay, everything else.

983
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,120
Spray it into my mouth.

984
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,960
No, do not consume Hawthorne.

985
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,560
We've been clear about this from the beginning.

986
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,120
You know, I was actually a Hawthorne subscriber

987
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,360
before they decided to advertise with this.

988
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,800
I was into it.

989
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,880
You answer some questions about your lifestyle,

990
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,240
how you like to live your days here on Earth.

991
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
Live moss.

992
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,000
Live moss.

993
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
And they're gonna give you a delicious batch

994
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,240

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,320
And if you don't-

997
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,160
If you don't like, go ahead.

998
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,960
You say it.

999
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,760
And if you don't like-

1000
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
If you don't like your-

1001
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,080
And if you don't like them-

1002
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,880
Say it together.

1003
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
And if you don't like your products,

1004
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,200
they'll even retail it there based on your feedback.

1005
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,320
Based on your feedback.

1006

I don't think we actually are doing that one anymore.

1018
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah, we stopped doing that one.

1019
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,360
Listen, I'm a hotshot Hollywood movie producer.

1020
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,440
You have until I finish my glass of kombucha

1021
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
to pitch me your idea.

1022
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:32,880
Go.

1023
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,760
All right.

1024
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
It's called Who Shot Ya?

1025
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,400
A movie podcast that isn't just a bunch of straight white dudes.

1026
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
I'm Ify Whiteyway, the new host of the show

1027
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,920
and a certified BBN.

1028
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,720
BBN?

1029
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,680
Buff black nerd.

1030
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,560
I'm Alonzo Duraldi, an elderly gay and legit film critic

1031
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,400
who wrote a book on Christmas movies.

1032
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,760
I'm Drea Clark, a loud white lady from Minnesota.

1033
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
Each week, we talk about a new movie in theaters

1034
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
and all the important issues going on in the film industry.

1035
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,280
It's like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner meets Cruising.

1036
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,920
And if it helps seal the deal, I can flex my muscles

1037
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
while we record each episode.

1038
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm sorry, this is a podcast?

1039
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm a movie producer.

1040
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,600
How did you get in here?

1041
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,440
Ify, quick, start flexing.

1042
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,520
Bicep, lats, chest.

1043
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,960
Who Shot Ya?

1044
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
Dropping every Friday on maximumfun.org

1045
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:30,560
or wherever you listen to podcasts.

1046
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,280
I have never been so certain about the product

1047
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,880
that you're going to talk about today

1048
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,480
as I am right now.

1049
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
You have no idea.

1050
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:37,840
Okay.

1051
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,160
Fatburger has introduced a product

1052
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,920
and I'm wild about this late-breaking story.

1053
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,040
This is Munch Squad, by the way.

1054
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
It's a podcast within a podcast.

1055
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,120
Profiling-

1056
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,000
In it's twilight.

1057
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,280
Brand eating.

1058
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,240
It is in its twilight.

1059
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,880
Thank you, Travis.

1060
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,600
It's winding down.

1061
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,240
It's on its final-

1062
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,520
Now, some people might point out

1063
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,680
that there's been a Munch Squad in every episode

1064
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,600
for the last 60 episodes.

1065
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,560
Not actually accurate.

1066
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,000
But that is just because this is the dying gasps,

1067
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,880
the death rattle.

1068
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm going to start with a junior

1069
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,840
because my real Munch Squad is not.

1070
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,880
I got a junior, then a junior junior,

1071
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
and then a full Munch Squad.

1072
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
Can we call the junior junior a kid's meal?

1073
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,680
Yeah, I got a kid's meal, a junior,

1074
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,920
and a full adult.

1075
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,880
And a big stinky.

1076
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
Let me just get through this, okay?

1077
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,680
Okay.

1078
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,040
In a year with-

1079
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,880
Fatburger introduces-

1080
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,960
Well, I'll save the name.

1081
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,640
In a year with unprecedented challenges-

1082
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,040
Oh, boy.

1083
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,320
There are only several more weeks to hang in there.

1084
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,640
Hollywood favorite Fatburger wants to help customers

1085
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,600
do just that until we ring in a fresh new year.

1086
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,840
To help get through the remainder of 2020,

1087
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,000
Fatburger, known for its delicious

1088
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,200
grilled to perfection burgers,

1089
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,080
is launching a limited time menu item,

1090
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,160
the Hang In There Burger.

1091
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,800
Oh, boy.

1092
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,760
Oh, boy.

1093
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,640
The Hang In There Burger is everyone's favorite OG Fatburger

1094
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,920
with all the fixings,

1095
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,520
including chili, onion rings, American cheese, bacon, egg,

1096
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,400
and topped off with, and this isn't quote, the works.

1097
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,440
Wait, if the works don't include those things

1098
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,760
you said before, what the fuck are the works?

1099
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Eh, questione.

1100
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,400
Maybe it's love.

1101
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,120
Hey, I got no idea.

1102
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,520
Quote, this year certainly has been challenging for everyone,

1103
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,000
says Andy Weiderhorn, CEO of Fat Brands.

1104
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,160
Everyone, fulfilling his legal obligation

1105
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
to mention that there is a global pandemic

1106
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,640
with the year almost coming to a close,

1107
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,680
we wanted to create a burger that encourages our loyal fans

1108
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,200
to simply hang in there, put a smile on their faces,

1109
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,240
and remind them that together we will get through this.

1110
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,320
I like that Fatburger has accepted that no one is thriving

1111
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,920
and the best that we can all hope for is to merely exist.

1112
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,360
Just eat this huge, ridiculous burger and get through it.

1113
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,400
Oh, thank you for having me.

1114
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,320
Loving me, it's me, Donut Dracula.

1115
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,440
Did Count Donut just climb out of Justin's throat?

1116
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,080
Count Donut is here, not Donut Dracula, that's my dad.

1117
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,580
Please.

1118
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm Count Donut.

1119
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,320
I've got a great new story about a delectable delight.

1120
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,360
Is it about a donut?

1121
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,200
Yes, Travis, it's about a donut.

1122
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,560
Why else would I be here?

1123
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,920
I don't know, Count Donut.

1124
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,840
Marks and Spencer is a UK brand and they have a new very fun donut.

1125
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,760
It's a yum yum donut hybrid that have been given a Christmassy makeover

1126
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,000
with delicious flaky pastry layers and a sweet center's belt topping.

1127
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,360
Now, if I could describe this, imagine a toasty flaky donut.

1128
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,480
Oh, I'm making myself.

1129
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,000
That's blood.

1130
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,480
And then on top, there is a red frosting

1131
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,000
and then there's a adorable brown belt with a gold buckle on it

1132
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,600
and it looks just like Santa's tummy and it's so precious

1133
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,080
and it's called Santa's Yum Nut.

1134
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,800
Yes, the tweet says, who wants a bite of Santa's Yum Nut?

1135
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,480
Hey, Gary, you're fired.

1136
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,800
You're fired, Gary.

1137
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,760
I wanted to remember the name of this

1138
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,320
because I saw a lot of people talking about Yum Nuts.

1139
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,080
There was a headline that some news outlet wrote that was like,

1140
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,200
M&S make an accidental emu window

1141
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,560
and everyone's making fun of them on social media now.

1142
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,160
I don't know how you could possibly accidentally-

1143
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,840
It's called Santa's Yum Nut.

1144
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,160
The tweet is, who wants a bite of Santa's Yum Nut?

1145
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
We all know what's going on here.

1146
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,920
It's time to talk about the real story and we've all been waiting for it.

1147
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,880
It's always a hot topic here on this program.

1148
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,080
Starbucks holiday lineup and peppermint mocha arrive November 6th.

1149
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,240
As we're recording this, that is today, I'm seeing the cup.

1150
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,720
Does it just have like a big crucifix on it?

1151
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,800
Oh, let me know about it, Juice.

1152
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
All right, buddy, hang in there.

1153
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,600
We're gonna get there.

1154
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,320
We got new, we got some holiday seasonal favorites.

1155
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,880
We got peppermint mocha, toasted white chocolate mocha,

1156
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,360
caramel brulee latte, chestnut praline latte, and eggnog latte.

1157
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,360
So that is amazing.

1158
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,960
I don't care about any of that shit.

1159
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,600
What's the cup?

1160
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,920
Okay, there's new, okay.

1161
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,120
This year's theme, carry the merry, is an invitation

1162
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,480
to enjoy the little moments of brightness around you.

1163
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,760
Hey, that better be M-A-R-Y merry, like the Virgin Mary.

1164
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,160
It better be carry a cup full of the Virgin Mary with you.

1165
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,760
Yeah, it was about people carrying them out into the world

1166
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,200
as quote, messengers of joy.

1167
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,200
That's how they think of someone who takes a Starbucks cup out of there,

1168
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
is to make a messenger of joy.

1169
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,040
That's Jeff Wilkinson, who is, I don't know how to tell you,

1170
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,240
creative director for Starbucks.

1171
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,640
In a way that message deepened as we got further and further into this year.

1172
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,360
Go on, Jeff.

1173
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,080
Fuck yeah.

1174
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,800
Do tell, bud.

1175
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,960
It's only getting better, Jeff says.

1176
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,480
Yes, we want that to be a beacon for people.

1177
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,640
A brief moment that they can look forward to.

1178
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,200
Oh boy.

1179
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,800
Does Jeff mean fucking seeing the cups?

1180
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,040
Jeff also means, if I'm interpreting this correctly,

1181
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,600
the worse it gets out here, you know, in life,

1182
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
the fucking doper these cups get.

1183
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,560
If a fucking volcano erupts in the middle of Austin

1184
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,920
and everyone gets covered in ash,

1185
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,000
but I walk out of the Starbucks with a cup,

1186
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,160
the employee's gonna be like, you brave missionary.

1187
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,680
Carrie the Mary.

1188
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,920
Carrie, it sucks so bad out there.

1189
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,680
People are looking to your cup.

1190
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,640
Hey Jeff, how about your message isn't like,

1191
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,320
hey everybody, go to Starbucks

1192
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,960
and then just walk around showing your cup to people.

1193
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,280
What if your message was stay fucking home?

1194
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,720
Stay home?

1195
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
Just stay at, that's our message.

1196
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,760
Stay at home.

1197
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,640
Stay the fuck home.

1198
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,640
How about bury the Mary in your backyard

1199
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,560
and then just go back to bed?

1200
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,880
If there is a sizable enough portion of the populace

1201
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,120
that needs the nasty burger and the fun cups

1202
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,600
to be able to quote, hang in there,

1203
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,720
the American experiment has failed.

1204
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,040
Yes.

1205
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,240
We are done.

1206
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,680
We can start over.

1207
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,680
The quicker we say we're done,

1208
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,720
the quicker we can start over and try something else.

1209
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,880
Hey, can I do a quick Yahoo?

1210
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,920
Cause I'm really curious about,

1211
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,480
I know you guys have a little bit of law experience

1212
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,320
and I was hoping you could bust me out some.

1213
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,360
I know it's after Halloween,

1214
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,880
so we're a little bit late on it.

1215
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,480
This one was sent in by Ben Cant.

1216
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,360
Thank you, Ben.

1217
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,400
It's Yahoo Answers user, Joe, who asks,

1218
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,000
is scaring people with a chainsaw legal?

1219
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,320
My brother and I have been scaring people

1220
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,760
five years with my chainsaw.

1221
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,400
And this year of Halloween,

1222
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,560
we got the cops called on us by a lady,

1223
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,920
but the cops never showed up.

1224
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,280
The cops never showed up.

1225
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,840
BTW, we were on our property scaring them

1226
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,200
and we never got too close to them

1227
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,480
and a lot of people like us

1228
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,360
and the chainsaw do its amazing sound.

1229
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,200
The chainsaw do its amazing sound.

1230
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,760
That is true.

1231
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,680
Hold on, I'm incapable of reading this.

1232
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,760
We never get close to them

1233
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,280
and a lot of people like us

1234
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,640
and the chainsaw due to its amazing sound.

1235
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,600
Oh, D-O-2.

1236
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,800
Okay, I see what they've done here.

1237
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,880
Updated three days ago is scaring people

1238
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,720
with a chainsaw on Halloween legal.

1239
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,400
So they wanted to really make sure that you-

1240
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,920
Oh, on Halloween?

1241
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,600
A little TLDR, yeah.

1242
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,320
I would argue that that detail is important

1243
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,480
because if it's like June 9th

1244
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,280
and you run at someone with a chainsaw,

1245
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,600
you're going to jail.

1246
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,640
I remember there was a,

1247
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,200
what was it, Trail of Terror?

1248
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,680
What was it called?

1249
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,360
There was a thing in Huntington

1250
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,160
that was haunted trail and you would go down it

1251
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,640
and there would be spooky events

1252
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,840
that would occur

1253
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,440
and sometimes one of them I remember

1254
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,800
was like it looked like headlights

1255
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,640
were coming at you through some trees

1256
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,680
and it's like, uh-oh,

1257
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,000
and there would be a couple mummies or whatever.

1258
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,960
But then at one part,

1259
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,080
a guy with a chainsaw

1260
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,200
would jump out of some corn.

1261
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,960
That was the grand finale.

1262
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,120
Yeah, he would chase you down the hill.

1263
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,160
And I remember thinking like,

1264
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,400
that's an escalation.

1265
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,200
Like you had a couple mummies back there

1266
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,840
and you had like a, oh, ghostly bride.

1267
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,720
But I'm a kid

1268
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,680
and you can't jump out at me with a chainsaw.

1269
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,240
And this is a hill in the woods

1270
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,600
in the middle of the night.

1271
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,640
Apparently there was no chain on it.

1272
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,800
It just due to its amazing sound.

1273
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,200
But I didn't know that.

1274
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
I remember thinking every time I did it,

1275
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,720
like, why am I going down this trail?

1276
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,840
Because I know death is,

1277
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,480
I know the specter of death is waiting for me at the end.

1278
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,160
And you wait such a long time.

1279
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,240
Just like pretty much every haunted house I've ever been to.

1280
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,600
And the whole time you're in line,

1281
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,420
you just hear like,

1282
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,960
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom,

1283
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,640
and you're like, oh yeah, you know it's coming.

1284
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,440
Get to that.

1285
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,560
Maybe it would be better

1286
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
if before you scared people with a chainsaw,

1287
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,120
you yelled, there's no chain on it.

1288
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,920
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

1289
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,880
That way you're still making its amazing sound.

1290
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,880
Yeah, that's good.

1291
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,440
So you can put up a sign in your front yard that says like,

1292
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,040
hey, you're about to be scared

1293
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,000
by a big gentleman with a chainsaw,

1294
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,560
but don't sweat it because there's no chain on it

1295
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,080
and he's not really going to hurt you.

1296
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,680
And then just for good measure,

1297
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,560
he steps outside and says, get ready to be scared.

1298
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,840
I'll be out in five.

1299
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:51,760
Oh no.

1300
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,880
But would you let him fly?

1301
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,740
Sorry?

1302
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,000
Would you let him fly with a chainsaw?

1303
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,800
Wasn't that the question?

1304
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,280
Would you let him fly in an airplane?

1305
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,920
Just, wait.

1306
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,360
Justin, there's no way that,

1307
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,120
there's no way you got there, right?

1308
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,240
If you got there for real and this isn't a goof.

1309
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,200
I thought the question was,

1310
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,920
are you allowed to fly on an airplane with a chainsaw?

1311
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,880
You did not think that.

1312
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,840
At no point, at no point,

1313
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,320
the transportation of this log cutting instrument

1314
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,720
come up in the question.

1315
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,440
Justin.

1316
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,920
Justin.

1317
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,440
I'm pretty sure the question was,

1318
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,880
are you allowed to fly in an airplane?

1319
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,600
That was not.

1320
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,000
I've gotten like six hours of sleep this week.

1321
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,720
Like I get it.

1322
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,560
We're all fucking tuned in, jacked in,

1323
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,320
fucking plugged in, getting that drip,

1324
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,560
getting that slow Pennsylvania drip.

1325
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,920
But my man.

1326
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,640
Those words were not incorporated,

1327
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,240
not only not in the question,

1328
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,560
but Griffin and I did not say them.

1329
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,600
Words not said.

1330
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,880
Why don't we read it again?

1331
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,560
Let's phonetically, let's read it again.

1332
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,240
Okay, let's see if Justin,

1333
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,080
we can find where Justin went wrong.

1334
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,400
My brother and I have been airport pilot,

1335
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,080
plane airport side clouds for five years.

1336
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,120
Oh, I miss it.

1337
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,920
I got so excited for a second.

1338
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,760
I thought vindication was on the horizon.

1339
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,840
No, sorry, it says scare port.

1340
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,400
Oh, no.

1341
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,360
Isn't every airport a scare port?

1342
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,320
Now, if you think about it.

1343
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,240
Get to the pain, we're ready to die.

1344
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,400
It's the best game.

1345
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,000
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1346
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,440
Thanks for hanging in there with us.

1347
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,800
We hope you're doing okay.

1348
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,000
You hope we don't need a burger to keep it going.

1349
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,920
We hope we can be that nasty burger.

1350
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,000
Hey, let us be your nasty burger and your cup.

1351
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,960
We'll be your cup and your nasty burger.

1352
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,360
If you do need something though, McElroyMerch.com

1353
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,080

1354
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,000
and get something that can talismanically

1355
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,080
help you ward off the seasonal affective disorder.

1356
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,880
Like what, Justin?

1357
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,840
Well, bud, whatever you want.

1358
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,760
Do you want a void fish pin?

1359
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,600
You want a vaccines bumper sticker?

1360
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,760
You want a horseshoe crab t-shirt from Sawbones?

1361
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,800
You want any kind of Sawbones merchandise you get

1362
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,800
and that I don't have to split the profits of that

1363
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,040
with my brothers is the way you want to go.

1364
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,160
We're bearing the lead here a little bit

1365
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,280
because coming up on November 21st,

1366
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,080
we're doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me live show.

1367
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,640
What?

1368
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,200
Holy crap.

1369
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,160
It's virtual.

1370
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,200
It's a virtual live show with Sawbones opening.

1371
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,280
It's our first ever virtual live show.

1372
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,560
What's it gonna be like?

1373
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,120
We don't fucking know.

1374
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,320
We have no idea.

1375
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,400
I know what it's gonna be like.

1376
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,000
It's gonna be a lot of fun for everyone.

1377
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,320
Okay.

1378
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,120
That's what I say.

1379
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,920

Virtually.

1387
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,360
What city will it be in?

1388
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,680
Every city.

1389
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,560
All cities.

1390
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,080
All cities.

Let me also give a plug to my favorite video game podcast, The Besties.

1409
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,080
Oh, thank you for having me.

1411
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,080
It's very good.

1412
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,040
The last episode, they talked about the new consoles coming out.

1413
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,600
Well, I guess that was the one before last because we're recording.

1414
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,880
It's not important.

1415
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,240
It's very informative.

1416
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,520
You're gonna hear a lot in the upcoming months about these consoles.

1417
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,200
You're gonna be confused about it.

1418
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
So why don't you let your best friends tell you what the bullshit is

1419
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,720
and what the real shit is.

1420
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,000
Cut through the bullshit.

1421
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,680
That's the signature sign off for that.

1422
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,720
The Besties, it's available exclusively on Spotify.

1423
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
Go subscribe down, tell all your friends.

1424
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,040
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winter's Fibus for a theme song.

1425
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed,

1426
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,720
and a huge ups to Max Fun for having us on the network.

1427
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,120
Huge ups.

00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,680

And let's close it up.

1430
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,160
I have a final Yahoo here.

1431
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,360
Hit me.

1432
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,520
Oh, this one was also sent in by Ben Kan.

1433
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,080
Thank you, Ben.

1434
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,120
It was asked by anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

1435
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,960
who I'm gonna call him Jim Davis.

1436
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:51,920
Okay.

1437
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,280
The Garfield guy.

1438
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,000
Because I think he would ask something like this.

1439
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,000
If Freddie Mercury was still alive,

1440
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,480
do you think he can play as Joker?

1441
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,440
Yes.

1442
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1443
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,640
I'm Travis, then.

1444
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1445
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,320
This has been my brother, my brother.

1446
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,280
May it kiss your dad.

1447
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,240
Square on the lips.

1448
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,080
