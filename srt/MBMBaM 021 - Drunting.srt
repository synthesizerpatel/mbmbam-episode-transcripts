1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have gone out of their way, take a chance on me.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sure, you get to take a day off once a year on a Monday, eat some meat, see your kids or once.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You should also miss out on my brother and my brother and me.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Our most sacred holiday at my brother and my brother and me.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Granted, maybe we should have warned people in the previous episode that we were going to be taking a siesta.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I thought that Labor Day was such a cherished day.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I thought it would be assumed that we were going to take our siesta.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What kind of life are you living that you know like a week ahead what you're going to be doing the next week? That's crazy.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's crazy. If we support one thing here on my bim bam, it's living in the moment.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And in the moment on Wednesday, we decided Labor Day wouldn't work out.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was very impulsive. It's a gift. That's why they call it the present.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, mill that over for a while. Did you see how angry people got?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, man, like tear it apart.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why are they trying to download a podcast on Labor Day?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why aren't they out drinking a Miller High Life with their buds and playing ladder ball?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here's a funny here's a funny truth that you can take from what you will. We're recording this on September 11th.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah. Well, so priorities, I guess. So who's mad now?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who's mad now, America? I put off my Patriot Day.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I forget what I do every year, but I do something and and I put it off for you guys.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You said you'd never forget. You're right.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So let's get it crack a lock. And this is, of course, an advice show for the modern era.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And Labor Day aside, we still are going to cling to that.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That ethos. God, I wish you guys could see the question list when Travis emails them out.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It would be less. It would be less crazy if he cut letters out of magazines and glued them to his scanner.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I swear to God, it looks it's just so many different things together.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
OK, here we go. So. Yes.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have a friend whose last name is McElroy.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Should I trust him? Given the fact that there was no new ma bim bam last week?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I wonder if it's all McElroy's that are liars or is that a particular trait reserved to the West Virginia McElroy clan for spring?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's all of them. You son of a bitch. You know what? Take a chill pill.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey, chillax. Is that it?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is that our answer to that one? That's our winning.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, I thought you were that your inflection said to me that you were that you were going into something, but you really just wanted him to take a form spring.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Pump those brakes. Pump the brakes. It's all good.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's all good. We needed the real reason we took the day off is because I was traveling and Justin was traveling and Travis was hunting four day drunk.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was hunting and on a four day drunk. I was drunk hunting.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We took a week off. We did some spirit journeying, some some literal journeying.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I, I dropped some. I dropped some peyote in a desert.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can can we address the fact that Travis just combined drunk and hunting into drunting?

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's never been drunting. It's a pretty killer portmanteau.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Every but there is no hunting without drunting.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was going to say, I'm pretty sure those two things can't be divorced from one another.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, although most of those guys actually divorce.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right. Interestingly enough, this weekend, me and my cousin, same age, are moving into our first apartment as roommates this weekend.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It seems like he's already slacking on apartment responsibilities.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We've split up like getting certain utilities.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What should I do?

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't let that shit hit the fans.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We learned the hard way to hold up his end.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Or do I pick up the slack so I can have electricity in my new apartment?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Rob, you know who I bet has a great answer for this?

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Griffin.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah. Hey, Rob, if you do let shit hit fan, he is going to start cleaning up around the place.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like if you throw shit into your fan.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, boy.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The problem is if you don't have electricity, the fan won't be on.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it'll just like hit the fan and then just like slide down.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It won't have the buckshot effect that you might be hoping for.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I find that like arrangements like these that I've seen in my life, and you guys probably have some more insight in this, but I think it works.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like, I don't think you should split up setting up utilities.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like, I think it should be there should be one person in charge of like making sure all that shit is on point.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then one person who has to write a check because if you split it up between two, it's not going to fly.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In every apartment I've ever lived in, I've always been utility man.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know why.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What the fuck?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know how it comes down to that always.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But like, I think it's maybe just I have like a subconscious control freak thing and I worry that if I don't do it, then the other people that I live with won't do it, which is a completely irrational fear.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And the glasses.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Except for maybe.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In any relationship, whether it's, you know, dating or living together or roommates or friends, there's always one person that's going to be more responsible than the other one.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so it makes sense.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Like, if one person was an amazing cook, why would the other person cook?

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know what I mean?

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sure.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're more.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So who was that party when you and I lived together, Travis?

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The more responsible one?

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It was you.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You think?

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But that is because Justin and I have trained you from a very young age to do anything.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
To be the bitch.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, if we're like, oh my God, the phone, you'll run and answer the phone.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I just did that with electric bills.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll be honest.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When you said that just now, I started to run into my kitchen.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I realize that.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You got halfway in there.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You realize, hey, wait a minute.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is a trick.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, I think it's more important that you just take up the utilities charge.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I think you can split duties as far as all the utilities you mow the lawn or do the

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
dishes.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But what is important is that you do talk about it.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because the last thing you need is to live with your cousin in two months.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And every time you see him, you imagine killing him in the night.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know what I mean?

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm upset with you.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I am upset with you.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I have feelings.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They live in this apartment with you.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Nate on Gmail asks, is it weird that I've been Facebook poking an ex-girlfriend of mine

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
solely for the fact that it's an excuse for her to keep me on her mind for quick hookups

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
whenever she's in town?

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Relationship wise, we're a horrible pairing.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But when it comes to getting down, it's crazy dope and seems like an ephemeral trip to the

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
bone zone.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Not a Gmail.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's how I'm going to say his name.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not Nate.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Not a.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'd say it sounds like not a.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You have a pretty good grasp of their relationship.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it is it weird?

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it despicable?

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Maybe a little sleazy.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But like, it's weird.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not weird that you're boning down on your ex-girlfriend every time she comes in

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
town.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Whatever.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like, that's your bag.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You guys have that arrangement.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Cool.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's weird is that the exercise that you conduct in order to facilitate said boning

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is a Facebook poke.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think you're thinking of a poke for a poke.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Maybe.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
My grandma pokes me every now and then.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Facebook pokes.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please put that in context.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
When you guys get poked on Facebook, do you imagine yourself getting poked in the tum

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and doing a little giggle and squeal?

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like, that's the kind of poke I always imagine.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I always imagine getting poked right in the base of the back of my skull and turning around

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
real quick.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hey, jerk.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Hey, jerk.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Turn around.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm poking you.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't think I've ever.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think maybe I poked someone back in the 60s.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think it's probably been a while since my last poke.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Man, 60s Facebook was the best.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you remember that?

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You know what we should do?

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think the MBMBAM community should start just crazy-ass poking each other.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think that we need to get pokes going again.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's like, hugs, kisses on the cheek, both of those are done.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ow.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Pokes are the new jam.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I just poked you.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Did you really?

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll start poking people right now on Facebook.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have it open in another window.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wait, wait.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Speaking of Facebook, I have to talk about this.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't think you guys got this invite to this exclusive event, but I got an invite

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to a MBMBAM listening party that's going on right now, hopefully, otherwise I'm making

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
a jackass out of myself, in Jeff Montblock's dorm room.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Did you guys get that invite?

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm looking at this guest list.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a high-class affair.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Would you say exclusive?

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There are only five people attending, so it's either exclusive or just really sad.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or both.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's a great idea.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's exclusively sad.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So Brendan and Henry and Jeff and Michael and Robbie, I hope the party's going well.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I hope maybe you're meeting some new people.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But I doubt it.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe you've got a dance mix that you're playing, maybe a little mingling.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think this is a great idea.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I think that listening parties are going to be a great way to spread the MBMBAM to your

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
friends and family.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Word of mouth is so much more contained and concentrated in a party situation.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just be careful, because I've never heard of a MBMBAM listening party that didn't turn

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
into a key party right afterwards, almost instantly.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You feel so smart, you're on a knowledge high, and then what's up?

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's amazing how tight those Venn diagrams are.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's 100%.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's what she said?

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, I wasn't sure.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now, ironically, I'll have to do a Venn diagram to see if that was funny or not.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm a 26-year-old male and have begun to notice a confusing trend.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's the proper way to greet an older woman?

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Griffin just demonstrated.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm not sure we have to go too much further.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Griffin, what is the proper greeting?

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I noticed that recently, when I greet women, they started kissing my cheek and not merely

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
giving the hugs I'm used to receiving.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
See, that's what I'm saying.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hugs out, kisses in.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do I go ahead and kiss them as well?

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Do I pretend the awkward moment never happened?

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Or do I punch them in the face like Travis is thinking?

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Help, please, Pat.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've seen an upsettingly positive response to Travis talking about punching women in

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the face during last week's show.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What seemed like an offhanded comment has become a doctrine amongst certain sects.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You tapped a weird, creepy vein that I'm not happy exists.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Someone heard that and was like, yeah, yeah!

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Finally, the voice I've been waiting to hear.

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then I started my own kind of fight club.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Only it's not a fight club.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No one talks about a woman-punching club.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They have a woman-punching fight club.

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's called prison.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We're in prison now.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Pat, you're missing out on the third option.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Do I go in a case?

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you pretend it never happened?

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You make it even more awkward by when they break away, you make intense eye contact and

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
say, I really appreciated that.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I needed that in the worst way.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
God, that was really nice.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That was exactly what I needed.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You smell like the sweetest cocoa butter.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That was nice.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Look them right in the nose and say, just one?

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Just the one?

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You don't want to go back for a second scoop?

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think the older you get, the more acceptable it is to have affectionate greetings.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Does that make sense?

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
As you get older, the more affectionate your greetings become.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The less smileable you are as a sexual partner.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Sure.

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think that's something you earn.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think that's something you unlock.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think if all of us had our druthers whenever we met new people, he'd give them seven minutes

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
in heaven real quick.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Just to suss them out?

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, just to suss them out.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
At my age of 23, I think I'm at a mid-range hug.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Not like a quick embrace like you did in middle school, but not like the long 30-something

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
this means something hug.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah.

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I decided to skip straight to my 80s.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
When I meet new people, I say something vaguely racist to them and then confuse them for my

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
deceased wife.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, I like it.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's said some people are like, I don't know, that's a bit much, but some people really

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
connect to it because they love old people.

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I tell them that they look like celebrities that have been dead for 30 years.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I like that.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You look just like Clark Gable.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you want to watch this original?

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yahoo answers.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This question was sent in to us by Cheesecake Jones.

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think you know what it is.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's a Yahoo answers question from Lindsay O'Malley who asks, what does my son mean?

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My son keeps saying something strange and I can't find what it means anywhere.

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll ask him to do something and he'll say, Mom, I'm on that like a dong nat.

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What does he mean?

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I searched on Google and got nothing.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is this a music reference?

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Drugs?

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
People smoke dongs with weed, but I didn't find one in his room.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Help.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let me get one of those glass blown pipes and what's the biggest weed dong that you

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
have that I can legally buy?

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For tobacco, of course.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I want to smoke tobacco out of the biggest dong you have in the store.

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Just the biggest one with a novelty name too.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Help me out, Travis.

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure you know more novelty dong names than I do.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't want to play this game because any answer I give is incriminating.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You always lose.

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You always lose this game.

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You guys are poking fun at this, but I think that there's a deeper level on which I am

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
concerned, and that is apparently Lindsay O'Malley's son has an infestation of gnats

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
on his dong.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He's the only one using this phrase.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That can't be a good sign.

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you Google dong nat and nothing comes up, it's a medical problem.

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is it possible that he has some sort of sexual fetish with rotten fruits that perhaps is

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
attracting some unwanted aphids?

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is it possible?

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, it is.

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Gnats are aphids, right?

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I got that right.

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I believe they're flies.

300
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Lindsay, I don't think you have anything to worry about except it sounds like your son

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is sweetly retarded.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Also, he's 35 years old.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't know if that's a problem.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Also, why does his crotch smell like a two-week-old, golden, delicious apple?

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hard to say.

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Actually, Lindsay, it sounds like your son's pretty cool.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If somebody out there in my real life said that, I would probably freak out a little

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
bit.

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, here's the scale.

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
35 years old, it's a problem.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
12 years old, coolest kid ever.

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Coolest kid ever.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So, where do I...

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is something Greggy, Greggy from Gmail, or Greggy from Gmail wants to know.

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Where do you find the motivation to finish a project?

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I have a terrible habit of starting projects, like Android apps, websites, games, et cetera,

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and never finishing them.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There's always a game to play, a movie to watch, or something less productive to do,

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
so it's hard to finish random projects.

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where do you find the motivation to build the empire that is my boom-bam?

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Are you kidding?

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you know how much motivation is required to poop out a show every week?

323
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or sometimes not?

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, I mean, yeah, really, it flagged enough that we took a week off.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Two weeks off.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We're really bad at this.

327
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The thing with the boom-bam is that, and part of what makes it...

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We don't need motivation.

329
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Our motivation to do it is that we really enjoy it.

330
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's kind of all the motivation we need.

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And all that money.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All that.

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, gosh.

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And all that sweet, sweet...

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Cheddar.

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Cheddar.

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That I buy with the money.

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These Siberian tiger puppies aren't going to pay for themselves.

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yep.

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait, are tigers puppies?

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you riding your tiger again during the show?

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We said during the show you wouldn't.

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But he's so epic.

344
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Have Gregor feed a mistake and keep him out of the room for like an hour.

345
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay, hold on a second.

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Gregor!

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes, no.

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Feed a mistake.

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Greg, listen.

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think I have this pit of energy in my belly that I can just reach down into.

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And not literally, but I visualize that.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like reaching down into my stuff, you know?

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And just pulling out the reserves that I need to get something done.

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Usually accompanied by a power jam.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That almost always does the trick for me.

356
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm going to preface this by saying that this might be something a lazy person says.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But if you don't have the motivation to do something, don't do it.

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just chill, man.

359
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, fuck it.

360
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Who cares?

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
At the end of the day, if you were to get hit by a bus, are you going to look back and

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
say, thank goodness I finished that novel?

363
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Or are you going to say, thank goodness I took that three-hour nap?

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll tell you what really helps motivate me.

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And you might want to try this, Greg.

366
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Once you accept the inevitability and ever-increasing closeness of your death, I think that will

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
really help to motivate you.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because you don't want to leave this world without an Android app in it, do you?

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You don't.

370
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's just around the corner, Greg.

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Just around the corner, Greg.

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Maybe pass in the Will & Grace marathon and get busy living.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Or get busy dying.

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or get busy dying.

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
One of the two.

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Shawshank!

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Greg, you've just been shanked.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You've been shanked, Greg.

379
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And if you got shanked, who would finish I Fart for the Android?

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No one would.

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's who, Greg.

382
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You are the only Greg we have, Greg.

383
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't leave us without your Greg-ness.

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, there it is.

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If that's not motivation, I don't know what is.

386
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Come on, Greg.

387
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And you can always call us, Greg.

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Also, speed.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Gives you that extra boost you need.

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Just a little bump.

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Just a little bumperoo to help you finish studying for that exam.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't do drugs.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't do drugs.

394
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm currently a senior in high school.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not.

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's not true.

397
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But Coney is, from Gmail.

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And Coney says, I'm in charge of making our prom go on without a hitch.

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Do you, as the Wizards of Kool, have any ideas for a venue, theme, or other advice?

400
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Underage drinking.

401
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Underage drinking.

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is it a problem?

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
As a theme.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I think every prom is secretly themed underage drinking.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's themed.

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I snuck vodka into this prom in this shampoo bottle.

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What about the inevitability and ever-increasing closeness of your death?

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
How does that grab you?

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's not terrible.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm trying to remember some of the themes of our proms.

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And there's stuff like Paradise City and stuff like that.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I think what you need to do is you need to find an awesome 80s metal band.

413
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And my advice?

414
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Pour some sugar on me.

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And as people walk into the gym, you just dump buckets of sugar on them.

416
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What about a night of drunting?

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Subtitle, the most silliest game.

418
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And you just have everyone drunt each other.

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, no, no.

420
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Camouflage dresses.

421
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Most high schools, they actually forbid that.

422
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There's a two to three inch rule.

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What?

424
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That you have to keep.

425
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You can't drunt anybody?

426
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah.

427
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Any orifices on two human beings have to remain at least two to three inches away from one another.

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's the new law.

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So does that mean if you shoot someone and create a new orifice, then you can actually get yourself in a catch-threat, too?

430
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

431
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like that kid.

432
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
To be fair, though, a lot of schools will allow bow-drunting.

433
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, bow-drunting is fine.

434
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:03,000
As long as it's a clean kill and you don't bring down more than, I think, 80 to 90 pounds of edible meat, basically.

435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There's a formula on most walls next to the sign that reminds you to wash your hands and read.

436
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Also, can I suggest Wizards of Kool?

437
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Wizards of Kool is good.

438
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How about a Roland Emmerich-themed prom?

439
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's just a bunch of disasters going on.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Whoa.

441
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I kind of like that.

442
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah.

443
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I don't just mean the pimply-faced kids.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean, like, real disasters.

445
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Like, literally, one corner could be 2012, right?

446
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So it could look like a big flood.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
One corner could be Men in Black?

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No, Independence Day.

449
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That one would be, obviously, aliens.

450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah.

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You could have a Godzilla area.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Sure.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
An area where you drop the temperature all the way down, day after tomorrow.

454
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, loving it.

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I love it.

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You have so many good ideas.

457
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If you can't come up with something out of these, then maybe you are the problem.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But, Kony, all those are patented, so...

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, any but those.

460
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Kony, you have a great opportunity right now.

461
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What if you made it a Kony-themed prom?

462
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Whoa.

463
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ooh.

464
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know how you'd go about doing that.

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Just, like, big pictures of himself.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Just big pictures of himself, like, throughout his lifetime.

467
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And nobody's allowed to dance except for him unless they're dancing with him.

468
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Does that make sense?

469
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What about...

470
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think that's the greatest idea ever.

471
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What about an evening of Mabim Bam?

472
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay.

473
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Subtitle, the only answer is slow dancing to Wilson Phillips.

474
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And it could be...

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And it could just be all about us.

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Make you want to turn around and say goodbye.

477
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Say goodbye to them, baby.

478
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm gonna let them hold you down and make you cry.

479
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't you know?

480
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't you know?

481
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't you know?

482
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Things are changing.

483
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Things are gonna go your way.

484
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If you hold on one more day.

485
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
One more day.

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I brought in Aaron Neville for a second.

487
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Wait.

488
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What?

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Aaron Neville.

490
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You bring it.

491
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm an unemployed mathematician.

492
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I send out resumes weekly to new places and haven't gotten a phone call or email back.

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My resume has a standard education, work experience, special skills, references, etc.

494
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm in an odd place where I am too educated for some jobs and not educated enough for others.

495
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Dummy.

496
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Since I have a master's degree, I can't get a job as a secretary or something like that

497
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
because they know I'll only be there until something better comes along, okay?

498
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
However, I don't have the experience needed for a lot of jobs

499
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
because I taught for the last four years and don't want to teach anymore.

500
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So what can I do to my resume to get noticed?

501
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Or should I just give it up and go get a PhD?

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Any help is appreciated.

503
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sad math girl.

504
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's who that's from.

505
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Which is nice.

506
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We ask that people send in nicknames.

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah.

508
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That one's kind of depressing.

509
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That one lands on the depressing end of the spectrum.

510
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But I suppose it works.

511
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Hey, I have a theory, sad math girl.

512
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What do you think about stop introducing yourself both in person and in your resume as a mathematician?

513
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Because I read that and I was just like...

514
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Snoozer.

515
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, right.

516
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's hit the snooze button on this question.

517
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah, there's no rule that says you have to put anything on your resume.

518
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So if your resume is like, this is too impressive, dumb it down.

519
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Dumb it down.

520
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How about math magician or numerologist?

521
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Both of those, I think, have a little bit of extra flair.

522
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I think that one of the real practical ways that you can pad out your resume is to take fencing classes.

523
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And now stay with me.

524
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think that if I was looking at a stack of resumes and you look at the experience, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You look at the bottom extracurriculars and you say, whoa.

526
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Fencing?

527
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And then you start to like construct a whole fantasy about this person because they're a sword fighter.

528
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They're out there fight with swords.

529
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You wouldn't want them on the team.

530
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't want to poke holes in your thing here.

531
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But I would wager that, oh, 90% of all mathematicians or members of the mathematician community belong to some sort of society through creative anachronism.

532
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Meaning fencing is just old hat to them.

533
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
They know all about-

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So they can put on their resumes swashbuckler.

535
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Still, still.

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Maybe not.

537
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Maybe you list amongst your curricular activities that you're not a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism.

538
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, I think that might be a true point.

539
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Just list a bunch of things that people would assume about you as a mathematician that you won't do.

540
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Like I won't tell you about integers or whatever.

541
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I promise.

542
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
My solemn promise to you.

543
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You need some sort of coolness indicator.

544
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Just not fencing.

546
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Maybe a list of all the famous people that you've met.

547
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That might be kind of nice on a resume.

548
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You've got to move away from this mathematician game.

549
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Because like we've all got calculators now.

550
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We're done with math.

551
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like as far as something we need people to be good at, no more of that.

552
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We're past that.

553
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You've got to style yourself as an adventurer who sometimes does math stuff.

554
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ooh.

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Right?

556
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Do you think when Indiana Jones hands in his resume, it says at the top like professor?

557
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Bullshit.

558
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Archaeologist?

559
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No.

560
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Archaeologist?

561
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No.

562
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It says dude who shot a guy with swords.

563
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Indiana Jones.

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Nazi puncher.

565
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Professional Nazi puncher.

566
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sad math girl.

567
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Wait, what's that?

568
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Your only job is for an archaeologist?

569
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, I guess I'll take it.

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Exactly.

571
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Exactly.

572
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You want someone on the team.

573
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Not someone who's good at math.

574
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Someone who's good at adventure.

575
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Hey.

576
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Speaking of studies.

577
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Here's a Yahoo Answers question.

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It comes to us from Tweeler H.

579
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Who asked?

580
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's very scientific too, so try not to laugh because it is scientific.

581
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Why do women like to eat men's diarrhea?

582
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
In parentheses.

583
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Gender studies.

584
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Check, please.

585
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Justin.

586
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Check, please.

587
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm out.

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hey, guys.

589
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm cashing out.

590
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Listen.

591
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm done.

592
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Blast my bim bam.

593
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Chill out.

594
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's gender studies.

595
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh.

596
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, it's science.

597
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's parenthetical.

598
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's gender studies, guys.

599
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Chill out.

600
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
With a bonus, like into the video.

601
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Two girls, one cup.

602
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Uh-huh.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Well.

604
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Travis, you went to like four psychology classes.

605
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Break it down for us.

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Well, people are weird.

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's all I got.

608
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So you went to psychology classes and obviously not gender studies classes.

609
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah.

610
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No.

611
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Well, it's funny that this comes up.

612
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Stay with me here.

613
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I promise.

614
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh.

615
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Inevitably, whenever somebody sits around and starts listing off different random weird

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
sexual terms like glass bottom boat and Cincinnati bow tie and things like that, the question

617
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
always comes up, who actually does these things?

618
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Who does that?

619
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't think that that's true.

620
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And you're saying that people on the internet do that.

621
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
People on the internet do that.

622
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If there's a phenomenon before the internet, no one did these things.

623
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But now you can't just fall off a table and expect to be internet famous.

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Is there any way that we can cut the internet out of the product that we make here at my

625
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Bim Bam Industries?

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So like we can bail out audio tapes.

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Like cassettes?

628
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Like individually.

629
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah.

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I love that.

631
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Get churches to like store them on a wall.

632
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I love that too.

633
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Like different numbered.

634
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I really love that idea.

635
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's just the internet makes me so uncomfortable.

636
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Like everything about it goes against everything that makes me uncomfortable.

637
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It makes me afraid.

638
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I know you're a mathematician, but I see an entry on your resume here for gender studies

639
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
specifically relating to why women like to eat men's diarrhea.

640
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Can you explain that a little bit?

641
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Hired.

642
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Was that your focus?

643
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Was that your minor?

644
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You're hired.

645
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Let's move on.

646
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm grossed out.

647
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm grossed out now.

648
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
My girlfriend and I can never pick dinner easily.

649
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We've tried setting up alternating nights of who picks dinner, going through all our

650
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
options together, and even picking out recipes and restaurants and assigning each one aside

651
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
on a D20 and then roll for dinner.

652
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
However, each night still ends up with a 30 minute conversation on what we eat regardless

653
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of our methods of choosing.

654
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Is there a better method to choose dinner?

655
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Almost certainly.

656
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
There has to be.

657
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Are we just doomed to an eternal existence of not knowing what we're going to eat?

658
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Or can the greatest advice Kaz let us know what to eat?

659
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The peckish pear.

660
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's the best one yet.

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The easiest way is what do you got?

662
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, what do you got in the house?

663
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because I tell you I'd love to eat steak every night, but most of the time I have frozen

664
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
chicken rings.

665
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What the fuck?

666
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's not real.

667
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
A chicken ring?

668
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Get right out of town.

669
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Can you elaborate?

670
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's like a chicken tender that has been bent into a circle.

671
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Just in case you want to wear it like a bracelet for snacking on the go?

672
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
What you do is you stack them on your fingers like rings and then you eat them off while

673
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
pretending to be Russian.

674
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's horrifying.

675
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Whatever happened to that middle brother that used to be on that show?

676
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Didn't you hear?

677
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
He ate chicken rings almost exclusively and died at the age of 29.

678
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Here's the bad news.

679
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
They've made me sick every time I've eaten them and I've bought three bags of them.

680
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I just can't stop.

681
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We need to have one entire episode just solely about Travis's diet because it is haunting.

682
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you know what I ate yesterday?

683
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Tell me.

684
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I ate an entire bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

685
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Christ on a bike.

686
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Travis.

687
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's it.

688
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And then a Dr. Pepper and cookies and cream ice cream float.

689
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Tell everyone about your regular breakfast meal because that's the worst thing I've

690
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
ever seen a human being consume.

691
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Like when I do a full breakfast?

692
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No, no, no, no.

693
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like your bagel.

694
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Your bagel monstrosity.

695
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
My bagel monstrosity.

696
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Like when I do like an everything bagel with mustard and cheese and banana peppers and

697
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
meat?

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Like that kind of thing?

699
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah.

700
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's a hearty breakfast and also lunch and dinner.

701
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's like an MRE that.

702
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh God.

703
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You skipped right past brunch to insanity.

704
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Somewhere along the line everyone loses that kind of childlike impulse where they just

705
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
sit in the middle of a kitchen and say, I want to eat all of this.

706
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Let's do it.

707
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Let's go for it.

708
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I have chosen to never lose that.

709
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So Pickish Pear, I think first you say, you just got to close things out.

710
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You got to say, do we want to go out or do we want to stay in?

711
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay.

712
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That takes care of like a huge portion of those things.

713
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And then you think about what you've had in the past.

714
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What did we have recently?

715
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And if that doesn't work, I always look at pictures of starving kids and I just eat the

716
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
first thing that's in front of me.

717
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Which is usually a picture of a starving kid.

718
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

719
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's why you can't have a picture of a starving kid in our house because I'll look at it and

720
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
just get so grateful and guilty about debating what I'm going to eat.

721
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I just eat the first thing I say.

722
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Here's a method Teresa and I use, which is whoever feels like cooking gets to pick what

723
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we eat.

724
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So like if she doesn't want to cook and I do, we're going to eat whatever I want.

725
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If I don't feel like cooking and she does, we're going to eat whatever she wants.

726
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's good.

727
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You could also use Travis's other method, which is to eat like you're going to commit

728
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
suicide later that day.

729
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Skydiving, everything, bagel eating.

730
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm actually writing a movie called Eat, Pray, Love, Be Sad.

731
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Eat, pray, love, cry yourself to sleep.

732
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Eat, nap, pray, nap, love.

733
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Disappointment.

734
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Cry.

735
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Sit on the toilet for four hours.

736
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
My wife and I have been married for a little over three years.

737
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
As we near our thirties, we are bombarded with questions dealing with having children

738
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
on a near constant basis.

739
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We had always said we'd have kids in the future, but as the said future gets close, we are

740
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
realizing we don't want to after all.

741
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We love our life, freedom, and knowing having children will change everything.

742
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It seems to be what society expects from a married couple.

743
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And when we mention our decision, they always try to change our minds or make us feel like

744
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
we're making a mistake.

745
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
How to respond to the criticism of others without having to justify our personal choice,

746
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Travis and Megan.

747
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay, so Travis and Megan, if you get to, I'm a married guy, so I feel especially qualified

748
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
in this.

749
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
If you get to fifty, right, and you said, God, we screwed up.

750
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
We should not have had, we should have had a kid.

751
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's too late.

752
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You're all dried up.

753
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
All dried up down there.

754
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's like a desert.

755
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But if you get to, so here's my suggestion.

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Have a kid.

757
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Just don't get like super invested.

758
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah.

759
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Just keep it on the sidelines.

760
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Keep it on the sidelines.

761
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Like I have a sideline kid.

762
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Maybe just like emotional, you can't, you can't put him in a freezer.

763
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
No.

764
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But like emotional freezer.

765
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Treat him like a third roommate.

766
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Right.

767
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They will be, if you withhold love until your past childbearing age, they will be so desperate

768
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
for that love or they will have moved out.

769
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But either way, you'll at least have your options open.

770
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I think, I think you're, you're denying the world of a little Tragen, which is what his

771
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
name would be.

772
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah.

773
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
A Tragen with like really great taste in podcasts.

774
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Here, here's my advice.

775
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Whenever you say to someone, I don't plan on having a kid and they say, why not just

776
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
stone face, look them right in the eye and say, cause I'd kill it.

777
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Accidentally.

778
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Accidentally.

779
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But like I don't trust myself to keep it alive.

780
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh my God.

781
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I have that thought.

782
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I have that thought on the reg.

783
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like what if I actually did create offspring?

784
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That thing would be dead in like 60 days tops.

785
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They're like glass peaches.

786
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Those things like you gotta be super duper careful with that.

787
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And I can't keep an iPhone without breaking it.

788
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I dropped, I dropped the same bagel yesterday morning three times before I got it to my

789
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
desk.

790
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Three times.

791
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Everyone knows Griffin loves bagels.

792
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Travis dropped a bagel yesterday, but it was in horror of what he was about to do.

793
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I can't do this.

794
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I had a moment of clarity.

795
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Then Teresa's like, why are you picking your bagel up off the ground?

796
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
My moment of clarity ended and I really want to eat this nightmare.

797
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This Holocaust of a bagel I've created.

798
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I went to the store and they have bagel packages on sale like for a dollar.

799
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I bought 10 packages of bagels and I have eaten all of them.

800
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Traygen, Traygen, listen, you need to get in now.

801
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Um, under because you're, you're approaching this wire that if you don't get in under

802
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it, either you will have a baby when you're like 40 years old against the laws of science

803
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and God, or you'll adopt one.

804
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Uh, but either way you'll be the creepy old parents who everybody doesn't know if you're

805
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
grandparents or what's the situation there.

806
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Are you some sort of foster family?

807
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Did their real parents die in some sort of horrible accident?

808
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Um, you would think all that matters is that you're providing the child a loving home,

809
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but you'd be wrong.

810
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Not true.

811
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You gotta be sexy.

812
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You gotta be sexy as fuck.

813
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Nope.

814
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
No one's ever heard of a, of a, um, uh, um, milk.

815
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Like a mom I'd like to know and maybe learn some things about mom.

816
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'd like to hang out with mom.

817
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'd like to chill with a milk.

818
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
All I know is that what you definitely want to do is to make a decision you're not sure

819
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
about and commit 18 years of your life at least to it.

820
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Uh, don't have a kid.

821
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You don't want a kid.

822
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't do it.

823
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Do it.

824
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I know it is.

825
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I want to dip into something that Travis talked about a couple of shows ago, uh, but he finally

826
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
followed through for this week's episode.

827
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We, we use Yahoo Answers as a pretty constant source of, uh, comedy.

828
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Uh, Travis suggested we, we dip into Wiki Answers, which is apparently a very, uh, similar

829
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
site.

830
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It advertises itself as the world's leading Q and A site.

831
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Um, only I, I'm seeing a lot of Q's and almost no A's.

832
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Uh, but Travis has picked a selection, uh, here that I'm just going to burn through really

833
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
quick, um, if that's okay with you guys.

834
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yep.

835
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yep.

836
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Um, do you think that the members of B5 can tell when thick girls that are their fans

837
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
get upset when they show the thin girls more love?

838
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
What are some reasons why people decide to love in a particular?

839
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Who is Alison's enemy?

840
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is suking cock dangaroos?

841
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
When a man starts calling you sugar?

842
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Do not give any reason to make me feel jealous, for I might do a thing that you may regret

843
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
for the rest of your life.

844
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What, which thing that dry measure two kilogram, wet one kilogram, and after burn three kilogram?

845
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Hey, Wiki Answers, what the fuck is going on on your website?

846
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
At least Yahoo Answers are like coherent, like bugs in my vagina.

847
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
What pesticide is recommended?

848
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Real question that I was going to ask on the show, but decided not to, but just did.

849
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like, but that's a thought.

850
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's a complete thought, uh, that is positing a query that is answerable.

851
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
My favorite on there just in like a meta way is, um, when a man starts calling you sugar.

852
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah.

853
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Like that's not even a sentence.

854
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's not even a sentence fragment.

855
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's like, it's just a collection of words.

856
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It doesn't mean anything.

857
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
In short, um, I don't think we can use Wiki Answers.

858
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I think it's the, I think it's this spiraling vermilion eye of madness that I just don't,

859
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't want to gaze into or else I'll lose who I am.

860
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So I want to, um, I want to hear the last question.

861
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We have something to talk about really quick.

862
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Griffin, I heard you had maybe kind of a bad experience.

863
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Well, um, last week's episode, we talked quite a bit about, uh, the food stuffs.

864
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Not last week's, our bad.

865
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The food stuffs, if you can even call it that, uh, known as super donuts.

866
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Uh, I think the three of us were looking back on that particular food with, um, with rose

867
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
tinted goggles.

868
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I think that, uh, I think that maybe our memories of super donuts were sweeter than the actual

869
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
food itself, uh, because I, I recently had, uh, or took part in a super donut party, uh,

870
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
when I was back in Huntington visiting and holy shit, those things are so awful.

871
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Um, what?

872
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
They're so bad.

873
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Let me posit you this question.

874
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Is it possible they've changed the formula?

875
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I think it, it's very possible cause I don't remember them tasting like, uh, wiener-less

876
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
corn dogs, which is the only way I can describe the flavor they're in, um, which if that sounds

877
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
appealing to you, then you're a monster.

878
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It, it was, it was really bad.

879
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We even warmed them up.

880
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
We microwaved them and we, we toasted them on a fire.

881
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Uh, neither method made them edible.

882
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Um, so that's my opinion on it, but, uh, we have a second opinion from close dear sweet

883
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
friend of the show, Evan Minsker, which I'd like to read.

884
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Uh, Evan Minsker's, uh, super donuts at counterpoint.

885
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Hello brothers McRoy, Evan Minsker here.

886
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
After the last episode of my brother, my brother and me, the brothers Minsker decided to throw

887
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
a super donuts party at the Minsker family home.

888
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We procured the super donuts from S and J market in Barborsville, bought far too many

889
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
of them, 27 donuts total, started a fire in the backyard, had beer and hot dogs.

890
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And of course the donuts upon eating the donuts, most of us learned that our nostalgia for

891
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
super donuts outweighed the actual taste.

892
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
As Griffin put it, they taste like corn dogs without actual dogs inside.

893
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
He informed everyone present that on this week's show, he would go on the record and

894
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
tell the world not to eat super donuts.

895
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I, all of this is true so far.

896
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I have, I've done all of that.

897
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's where I take issue.

898
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Okay.

899
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So yes, they do taste like corn dogs on that point.

900
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I concede.

901
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But now that the party's over, I was left with approximately 16 super donuts.

902
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yes.

903
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That means I have to either eat all of them or give them away.

904
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So here I am doing God's work, eating super donuts every effing day until I run out.

905
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But there's a twist to this story.

906
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I become acclimated to the corn dog with a hint of cinnamon taste.

907
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think I've gotten in touch with my inner elementary schooler and alas, I think they're

908
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
terrific.

909
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Fun fact.

910
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Did you know that a super donut fulfills the USDA requirement for a fruit or vegetable

911
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
as well as a bread?

912
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's true.

913
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And they're full of vitamins.

914
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh man.

915
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
There are so many vitamins.

916
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
They have to print the ingredients on a transparent background, making it impossible to see what

917
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
it is that you're actually ingesting.

918
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So brothers, I say this.

919
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
If you're going to tell listeners not to eat super donuts, make one amendment.

920
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Don't just eat one super donut.

921
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Buy 27 and be forced to eat about 16 of them.

922
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The nostalgia and deliciousness and heartburn will kick in after donut six.

923
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The shame kicks in around 12.

924
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
God bless, Evan Winsker.

925
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So Evan, thank you for that heartfelt.

926
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Evan proves a rule, something I've always believed that if you expose yourself to anything

927
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
enough, your opinion on it will reverse.

928
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think he's got super donut Stockholm syndrome, and I think that they taste worse than AIDS

929
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and no one should ever eat them ever.

930
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I think that's probably stretching it.

931
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I bought one on eBay, so we'll see how that went.

932
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Did you really?

933
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Hell no.

934
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What?

935
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Buy donuts on eBay.

936
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Evan actually gave me a big...

937
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's a box of them sitting next to the bonks at my local gas station.

938
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I plan on eating one.

939
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Did you say next to the dongs?

940
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yeah, next to the dongnads.

941
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I just...

942
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They're the worst food I've ever consumed.

943
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Evan gave me a bag of them to give to you guys, and I forgot, for which you're welcome.

944
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is it possible that they are both the best and worst food you've ever consumed?

945
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Because like 12 years ago, they were totally the best food.

946
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, they were really good 12 years ago.

947
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Maybe they're just the same ones.

948
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So they fermented.

949
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
They stopped making them in like 1993.

950
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Exactly, exactly.

951
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
These are really good fresh.

952
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, but 12 years later.

953
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I want to thank you.

954
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Thank you.

955
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Thank you for hanging in with us.

956
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Thank you for allowing us to take a week off to recharge.

957
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Sometimes we need that time to ourselves to become smart again because we let all our

958
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
smart go every week through the microphones, then we have to get it back.

959
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So thank you for that.

960
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Thank you to everyone who has purchased t-shirts.

961
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
There are still plenty of t-shirts available.

962
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
If you would like to purchase them, you can check that out on nbmbam.com.

963
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
There's still a facelift coming there, so make sure to get up on that.

964
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
We also have an app.

965
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
There's also available on the buy stuff link on our website.

966
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's called the My Brother, My Brother, Me app experience.

967
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's got some goofy stuff on there.

968
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And plus you can listen to every episode of the show straight from your phone, which is super nice.

969
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But I would like to throw out a special thanks to the guy at PAX that told Justin I was his favorite.

970
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah.

971
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Hey dude at PAX, you're my favorite.

972
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And I also want to say thank you to JJ Holder who is the only person I saw at PAX wearing

973
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
a My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt.

974
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And boy howdy did he ever get the hug of the century, my friend.

975
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Wow.

976
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We haven't given up our phone number in a while.

977
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's 203-mbmbam1.

978
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That's 203-mbmbam1.

979
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Give that a ring.

980
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
We've actually gotten a couple calls over the past week or so.

981
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But before that it had been like a month since our last telephone call.

982
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So give that a ring.

983
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
We're not going to answer, we promise.

984
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Just leave us a message telling us about your day or ask for advice because we'll dip in there for advice.

985
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:26,000
As always, we love seeing your quote tweets on the Twitter with the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag and just generally spread the word.

986
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
A lot of people have been helping us out this week in our absence.

987
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Brentalfloss, Kappen underscore US, The Gamer Geek, Kate Nash.

988
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Tons of people have been just really telling people that the most important thing they can do is listen to the show.

989
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And that is true, has always been true, will always be true.

990
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Just tell a friend.

991
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Tell a friend.

992
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
My good friend, John Mahaffey, he spreads the word as Johnny Mad Ass on Twitter.

993
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So follow him.

994
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Follow everybody.

995
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Let's get a community going.

996
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And don't forget to poke.

997
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Just get those pokes going.

998
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Just get those pokes going.

999
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If you get a poke, the useless, useless poke, you'll know that somewhere a M-B-M-B-A-M fan cares about you.

1000
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
What I want to see is people poking people from the M-B-M-B-A-M appreciation group available on Facebook.

1001
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
There's also a link to that on our site.

1002
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Don't just poke all the attractive ladies, though.

1003
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's skeezy.

1004
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Poke everyone, not just all the attractive femme fatales on the group.

1005
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
In fact, I want to say this.

1006
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Everyone, poke my dad.

1007
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Don't fight it.

1008
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Poke Clint McElroy and poke Clint McElroy.

1009
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Oh, my God.

1010
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Don't do that.

1011
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's weird.

1012
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So, Griffin, I think poke your dad square on the lips.

1013
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, gross.

1014
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So, Griffin, just stop it.

1015
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You're the only one who can stop it.

1016
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You've got to stop it.

1017
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

1018
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Let's shut this shit down with a Yahoo Answers question that was sent in by Eric.

1019
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank you, Eric.

1020
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This one comes to us by a Yahoo Answers user, Neutron Solstice, who asks,

1021
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Does the blood of Jesus cover the sins of Neanderthals too or just Homo sapiens?

1022
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
How am I going to break through this?

1023
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1024
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1025
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1026
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
This has been my brother, my brother, me, your dad, square on the lips.

1027
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You will never know me.

1028
00:49:44,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Jesus probably had a little Neanderthal in him, so, yes, it also covers 95% of every

1029
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
chimpanzee.

1030
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They also share 95% genetic similarity with us.

1031
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So, this answer is saying that 95% of chimp sins are washed away as well?

1032
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Not the cardinals, no.

1033
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Just the big ten.

1034
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think I read that somewhere in the Beatitudes, perhaps.
