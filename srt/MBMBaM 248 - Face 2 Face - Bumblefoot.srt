1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey everybody, this is my brother, my brother, me, I'm Justin, et cetera, et cetera, we do all that shit later.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,020
But I wanted to step in real quick before you start listening to the show. It was recorded live at Milwaukee's

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,740
beautiful Turner Hall. It gets really weird at the end,

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,000
so make sure you check out the whole thing. And if this leaves a taste in your mouth

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,800
for wanting a good taste that you want to taste more of our live performances.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,240
A taste-tation, if you will.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
A taste-tation, and you live in the Pacific Northwest, you can do exactly that. Travis, tell them how.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,560
Well, we've got three shows. One in Seattle. Were you jerking off?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,040
What? Were you jerking off and that's why you didn't respond quickly?

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,620
Why is that where you went? I don't know. I thought I heard some jerk noises. Go ahead, Travis. Go ahead and hit me.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,800
Okay, we've got three shows. One in Portland, then Seattle, then Vancouver.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:56,120
The links you're looking for are bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle, bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Portland,

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,560
and bit.ly forward slash V-A-N-M-B-M-B-A-M.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,660
It's the end of August is when we're gonna when we're going to visit ourselves upon you. P-N-W.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,920
By the way, the Vancouver show and the

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,080
Seattle show are reserved seating, so don't sleep. And Portland's almost sold out, so super don't sleep on that one.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, don't sleep on any of them. But anyway, here's our Milwaukee episode. I hope you enjoy it.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Thank you, Milwaukee, for the good times, if you know what I mean.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
We had sex with Milwaukee.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,560
Here we go. And their advice should never be followed.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,500
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,760
What's up, you cool, baby?

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,760
What's up, Milwaukee?

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,600
What did you do? What did you do? Let's start this show with a fucking confession. What did you do?

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,820
What did you do? I left my computer upstairs. You left your computer upstairs. Why would you need a computer for a comedy podcast?

27
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
I don't know. It's all up here.

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,020
Okay, what's our first question, Justin?

29
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,180
My brother forgot his laptop.

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,700
There are 600 people watching. What do I do?

31
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
Oh my god, there's a lot of people out here.

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,060
So what's going on, guys?

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,820
I really liked when we were doing the soundcheck.

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,940
The sound guy was like, it's gonna sound a lot different when this room is full of meat baffling. And I was like, that's great.

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,900
Yeah, I just, that's our first joke of the night, and it was stolen.

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,380
So let's see, you already stole the Milwaukee. You talked about the Wisconsin Dells.

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,940
No, we didn't finish talking about the Wisconsin Dells. Here's a funny story. Have you ever been to it? I was about to call it...

38
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,740
I was like, if you haven't, go right now. Yeah, it's amazing.

39
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,740
It's, I was about to call it the Pigeon Forge of Wisconsin, but... Wow, okay, yeah, a lot of people have made that announcement.

40
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
That hit better than I thought it would.

41
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,380
Someone real anti-Pigeon Forge. Yeah.

42
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,900
I know they're not anti-Dells, because how the fuck could you be?

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,260
They got Wizard Quest. They have a place called...

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:03,580
Oh, yeah, some Wizard Quest fans in the house. Some Questos in the house. The most direct titling of an adventure ever,

45
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Ghost Boat. Ghost Boat?

46
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,620
Or was it Boat Ghost?

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,940
No, it was Ghost Boat, because a Boat Ghost is a dead boat. Yeah, sure. There was a place called

48
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:23,340
Cinchilladas, not making that up. Not BS, that's true. I can curse on this one, I forgot. Shit, shit, shit.

49
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,140
Yeah, this is, it's funny, because the people who were in the car, Travis and I were up front, navigating and driving, and

50
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,740
the people who were in the car, who were not us, when we got off of this exit, the baby had to

51
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,820
eat. The baby had to nurse. We had to stop. Babies. Babies.

52
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,980
So Sydney says, we, whenever you guys could find a stop, and I looked like a

53
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:55,100
heroic dad, because we pulled off almost instantly. Because it was seconds after seeing the Wizard Quest billboard.

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,140
Well, you were praying, Jesus God, somebody need anything.

55
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,660
So, yeah, we pull in, and everyone in the car who's not us is like, wow, can you believe we just pulled into a

56
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,500
stop? Justin is saying, not even a wizard, just like, so de voce, just like, just keep going.

57
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,620
Just, it's a mile. Wizard Quest is one mile off the road.

58
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,020
And we weren't even gonna stop, we just wanted to pass it.

59
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,180
Yeah, we just wanted to drive past Wizard Quest, and we also did pass by the Paul Munyon lumberjack show.

60
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,180
It was, listen, the whole place looked like a fever dream.

61
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,940
There was a building that had on top of it, an octopus fighting a King Kong.

62
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:45,420
With no sign as to what the building was, like, you're gonna go, oh, yeah.

63
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
It was actually, it was an Applebee's.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,700
It was like a fucked up Lovecraftian Applebee's.

65
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,140
I'm gonna break open this local brew real quick.

66
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:03,140
The hardest, the hardest thing to process about the Wisconsin Dell is I saw maybe 30 people in about two hours who I

67
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,260
hand on a Bible would swear the thought going through their head was, I'm having a fun day.

68
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,340
While at the gift shop, I bought my wife a magnet, and it said, this is just the Wisconsin Dell episode, huh?

69
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,460
The magnet said,

70
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,460
good girls go to heaven,

71
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,540
bad girls go shopping,

72
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,220
Wisconsin Dells.

73
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,540
I thought this was ironic and funny. I thought bad girls want to buy fudge because that's what they have for sale.

74
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,060
So I bought it, and I brought it to my wife like this,

75
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,180
and I had to return it.

76
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
And you'll never imagine,

77
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:52,180
I wish I could have taken a snapshot as the poor 18 year old shop girl's face at the

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,260
Wisconsin Dells gift shop. As I said, as I said the sentence, my wife didn't think this was as funny as I did.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,220
Can I exchange? This joke magnet, apparently I got the joke already. It's all used up.

80
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,460
A new joke, please. Can I exchange this $3.50 magnet for a different $3.50 magnet?

81
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,860
You can't just read them in the store. Like, hey, get out of here. You're using all the jokes up.

82
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,820
After you said my wife didn't think this is funny as I was, did you, did she point up and you noticed that that is

83
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
in fact the name of the store?

84
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,380
The only thing that comforted me was I just kept telling myself,

85
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,180
I can't be the first person to say this sentence in this store. Like, yeah, I get it.

86
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,340
I get it. We've all been there. Even though your wife didn't, I get it. Because another themed magnet

87
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,300
they had was a sandal themed, we're in the middle of Wisconsin.

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,740
I wish you had just bought all the fucking magnets and then we could have some jokes in this episode of our comedy podcast.

89
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,660
Jesus, please. We're on a goddamn Prairie Home Companion tear, Wisconsin Dells edition.

90
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Take that, Garrison Keillor.

91
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,300
Even Garrison Keillor at this point would be like, fucking wrap it up.

92
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,420
Come on. You are being very long-winded, I said for the first time on the show.

93
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,820
Who has listened to our show before?

94
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
We haven't even fucking introduced ourselves.

95
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,740
Thank you. Thank you. Wait, no, wait.

96
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,260
We could be anybody though, because we haven't said our names. The name of the podcast.

97
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,020
This is my brother, my brother, me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

98
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy, the fucking

99
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,860
conductor of this orchestra, apparently. You remember? Like, people asked us questions and we're like, yeah, dicks.

100
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,260
That's a typical breakdown of our show. There's an A block, a B block, there's a denouement.

101
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,140
We don't talk about Wisconsin Dells for a half-fucking-hour.

102
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,180
Who hasn't listened to our show before? It's alright, just raise your hands.

103
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,140
Nobody's gonna not, nobody's never listened to our show before and also isn't at the Badgers game right now.

104
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah, who here decided to go to the Badgers game instead of the my brother, my brother, me show trick question? Yeah.

105
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Tricks on you, though, because that money still spins. Thanks, suckers. Go ahead, Justin.

106
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,320
So what we do is we take questions from people and we give them advice. We turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

107
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,700
And we're gonna do that for you right now. I have some questions here. Well, I have some questions on my laptop. That's upstairs.

108
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,940
I can't fucking believe you did that. Let it go. Now I have questions on Travis's phone.

109
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,300
I hope I don't get embarrassing texts

110
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
from my wife.

111
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,660
I still don't think, I still don't think that magnet is funny, sincerely, Teresa.

112
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,060
We, okay. Oh, I just got it. I just got it. And there's a picture of her laughing here.

113
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Or screaming. She's one of the two.

114
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,580
Question, question, question. We are at that age where a lot of our friends are having kids.

115
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,600
We ourselves are not planning on having our own children, but we like to make our house welcoming to parents and entertaining to kids.

116
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,280
So we can continue to host parties and keep our relationship with our new parent friends. Any advice for

117
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,420
awesome games and activities to keep around for the kiddos, as well as conveniences that'll make our friends more comfortable.

118
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,440
That's from not the mama in Minneapolis.

119
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,300
Nice. Except tonight when we're in Milwaukee. You here? Hi.

120
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,580
You know, we did a show in Minneapolis last night. Can I just say, you're a saint.

121
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,740
Yeah, that's really cool of you. I don't have a child, but my friends and brother that does, it sucks.

122
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,700
Whoa.

123
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,580
Kind of a cool thing to say. No, no, no. I mean if you're them. I mean if you're them. Not, no, not me.

124
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,300
I love babies. It sucks to have an infant daughter. She's the light of my life.

125
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,800
Real buzzkill. Okay. Yeah, all right. Have you tried showing her the room? She doesn't get it.

126
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,620
She's like this isn't funny. I don't. Hey, uncle Travis, this magnet sucks.

127
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,380
You're an idiot. I hate you. Oh, wait, where did the magnet go? It's gone forever.

128
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,780
What a sweet reality that would be. Every time that magnet left your field of view, it was dead.

129
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,820
You guys have been hanging out with my baby for the past three days.

130
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,340
What, if you were to, when you're gonna go home and prepare an area in your home that's specifically for my child,

131
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,100
what steps will you take? Hall of mirrors. Yeah, that's true. Babies love that shit.

132
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,940
Babies do love them shits.

133
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,460
Yeah.

134
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,180
Especially if they're different sizes and different heights and you can be like, this is you baby. If you were like your normal size,

135
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,180
this is you eight feet tall. They're like, what the fuck?

136
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,340
You gotta get them high first. Yeah, super duper high.

137
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,820
Keep some kind butt around for babies. How about a... I got you some strained weed.

138
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
It's from the earth, baby.

139
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,420
Don't be a prude, baby. They eat Cheerios the same way as stone people.

140
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah, my ba...

141
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,060
That's actually true. My baby just started eating these little cheesy poops called little crunchies.

142
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,060
She looks exactly... Holy shit, it's the funniest thing in the universe. She looks exactly like David Hasselhoff in that hamburger video.

143
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,420
Sometimes it'll get stuck to her forehead and like, where'd it go? I don't know, I moved on. Much, much like the Hoff,

144
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,100
she just sort of... Friend of the show. Friend of the show, the Hoff,

145
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,620
she just sort of puts material in her mouth and waits for it to dissolve like a goddamn Venus flytrap.

146
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,980
She's a miracle. She's a miracle and she's your everything.

147
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,900
I would do like you just like a room

148
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,500
that's just like a like a baby pool with like like six inches of just standing water in it.

149
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:53,060
Because there's just... There's just a constant seepage, just a constant fluid slime.

150
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,140
There's just a fucking constant discharge.

151
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,100
It's just a good old-fashioned baby soaking. Or for humans too, because it's like this is my nice Oxford.

152
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,340
Thank you for the gift. You're Justin's everything and I adore you too, but I need a room that I could just like lay down in

153
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,340
and be clean. That is a good question.

154
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:17,100
Justin, as a father, have you started to alter your wardrobe away from your nice Oxfords to maybe some shittier shirts?

155
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
Yeah, Justin, from your fucking...

156
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,260
I am... From your Nordstrom's finest to...

157
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:33,100
You go from the Margaritaville collared shirt to just a Tybee Island v-neck.

158
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,060
See, Griffin got mean, so I was gonna say maybe a room of smocks.

159
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,300
We were checking out of our hotel this morning in Minneapolis before the drive.

160
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,340
God, I wish this story took place in the Dells.

161
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,220
And right before we were about to leave, my infant daughter was

162
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,500
naked, because I was changing her, and I stood her up to look at her and just observe her majesty, and she...

163
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,700
A giant pee right on the bed of the hotel.

164
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,620
And at first I was like, eh. And then I was like, that's the most rock and roll thing I've ever seen.

165
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,700
You're like Axl Rose the baby.

166
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,700
It's the only rock and roll thing that has happened to us on this fucking tour so far.

167
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,700
That's true. You and I have had drooling nosebleeds.

168
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Travis and I have had four nosebleeds today between the two of us, and it's our second day of the tour!

169
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
The second of three days!

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,700
It was so rock and roll that my brain went, wait, two days?

171
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
No way. The road's tough, man. We're not made for the road.

172
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
How about a Yahoo answer?

173
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Yes.

174
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Dave Page. Thank you, Dave.

175
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,700
This was sent in by Yahoo Answers user Mary. 0% best answers. Better luck next time.

176
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Mary asks, found a Chex in a new candle.

177
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
I bought a candle from Goodwill that came from Target. It was brand new.

178
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Never been lit. Not even scratches.

179
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:16,700
But after two nights of lighting, I saw something in the middle, so I dug it out, and it was a Chex cereal piece.

180
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,700
How did that happen? Was someone eating Chex mix while making candles?

181
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Does anyone know? Should I ask Target?

182
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,700
I'd post a pic of the candle too, but I can only do one photo.

183
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,700
And then fucking sure enough, there's a Chex.

184
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,700
It's got a little bit of burn on it. It's been caramelized a tad.

185
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
That's a fucking Chex dug out of candle.

186
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,700
There's so much to unpack here. Two quick things.

187
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,700
One, is the singular Chex? Is it a Chex?

188
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I saw a Chex. I saw a Chex. I saw a Chex.

189
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
I think it's a Cheese. I saw a Chex.

190
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:06,700
The other thing, I don't think Target provides support for candles you bought at Goodwill after someone bought them at Target.

191
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Hold on, hold on. Let's do that call. Justin, call me.

192
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Bring, bring.

193
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Hi. Yes, hello, Target.

194
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Hi, it's me. A real piece of shit.

195
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Uh-huh. Go on.

196
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,700
I was about to post a question that I would answer, but I wanted you guys to get a chance to set this right first.

197
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Yes, of course, of course. How can I help you?

198
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
I bought a candle at Goodwill that someone bought at Target first.

199
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Uh-huh. Well, let me say, I was trained exactly for this. Let me do everything I can to help you.

200
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
What is the issue you're dealing with?

201
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
There's a Chex in it.

202
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Oh, not again.

203
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Again.

204
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,700
I got to talk to Chexy Steve down on the assembly line.

205
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm bored.

206
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
That wasn't a character. I'm just bored over here.

207
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
You didn't give me a bit.

208
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,700
What if you called in and you cost Chexy Steve his job?

209
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Yeah.

210
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Yeah, listen, somebody who's eating Chex on the assembly line as they make Target candles doesn't have a long way to fall.

211
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
I have low blood sugar. You know that.

212
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
You know that.

213
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
I have to eat Chex or I'll die.

214
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Okay, but imagine-

215
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
It could have been Karen, Trisket Karen.

216
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Your Chex mixed Steve, and you're fucking grooving over the assembly line, over the cauldron, I guess, and a single piece of Chex.

217
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Let's just say Melba Toast because it's easier to singularize, but a single piece of Melba Toast falls out of your mouth and into the machine.

218
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
You're not going to be like, stop, stop the whole-

219
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Stop the process.

220
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Every fucking second that machine is stopped, that company is losing billions of dollars.

221
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Do you guys think that maybe it was just a candle wick and this person's mother has been giving them candle wicks their whole life and calling them Chex?

222
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
You want a snack?

223
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Have some Chex.

224
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
Chex?

225
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Don't tell him.

226
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Don't tell him.

227
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Please, things are hard enough. Let Charlie Bucket have this one last dream where he's eating Chex.

228
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Cheer up, Charlie. Have some waxy poops.

229
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Well, you read a human being question now.

230
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Here's one from a human about a month ago.

231
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Is this okay?

232
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
You're doing great.

233
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
All right.

234
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I know how my phone likes it.

235
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

236
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
The day after he-

237
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Is this yours?

238
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
This is right up your alley.

239
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
You're laughing at your own brand, huh? You're a big fan.

240
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, yeah, this next-

241
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Guys, this next-

242
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Yeah.

243
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh, shit.

244
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Shut up.

245
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Shut up.

246
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Listen, you're going to love this shit.

247
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Check it.

248
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Yeah, guys, there's nothing I hate more than people who laugh at themselves.

249
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

250
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Can I get some more of that booze while I'm reading this? Thanks.

251
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
What is this, by the way?

252
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,700
This is repeal reserve rye, extremely limited.

253
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Somebody gave this to us in the crowd.

254
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
It's amazing.

255
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
It's wonderful.

256
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Thank you, whoever you are.

257
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
It's really good.

258
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I feel bad about mixing it with Diet Werners, but them's the breaks in the road.

259
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Diet Werners is the best ginger ale in the universe.

260
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,700
We were also given a bunch of Werners. Is Mr. Werners here tonight?

261
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Mr. Werners? Vernon Werners? Are you here?

262
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,700
About a month ago, we hired – put some Werners in there, too.

263
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
You got to cut that bad boy, okay?

264
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
About a month ago, we hired a dog walker for the first time.

265
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Have you guys gotten that part? Cool.

266
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,700
The day after he walked our dog, my wife and I found a sweatshirt in the interway that belonged to the walker.

267
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,700
While we intended to email the dog walking company, we had forgotten to do so until recently rediscovering the sweatshirt.

268
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,700
It's been a month, and we don't plan on using the service again.

269
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,700
What do we do, brother? Send off an email a month after the fact? Donate it? Throw it away? Keep it?

270
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,700
As from charity, combust or conversion? You are here, correct?

271
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Hey, how's it going? Are you wearing the sweatshirt now?

272
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,700
That would have been a nice touch. That would have really committed to the bit.

273
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I have two questions. Thank you, Scraps, by the way.

274
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Question one for the drink. You're welcome.

275
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Question one. When you say, we intended to send the email, did you? Did you?

276
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,700
You know how they work, right? Because, hey, he left a sweatshirt.

277
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Ten seconds.

278
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Second question. What did he do that you didn't bring him back?

279
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
He walked the dog counterclockwise.

280
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Is this fucking sweatshirt? Were there, like, letters from the war in the pockets?

281
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Wait, why does that change things?

282
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
It's a sweatshirt!

283
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:56,700
If somebody I paid to do a service for me leaves a sweatshirt in my house, it's not mine, but it's not theirs anymore.

284
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Wait, hold on.

285
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,700
What if it's weighted down with emotions? Like, that was the sweatshirt I wore when I saw Death Cab for Cutie.

286
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,700
If the weight is provided... Yes, that was an emotional concert for me.

287
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
I lived, I learned, I grew.

288
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Can we break the word down for a second?

289
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Like, if you are wearing something called a sweatshirt and you have any expectation that someone's gonna, like, keep it in a cubby in their home...

290
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Where are my piss pants? Oh, I left them at my job again.

291
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
These are my good shit khakis.

292
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,700
A sentence no one should ever say. That's my finest sweatshirt.

293
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,700
I left my jizz bandana at their house. Not again.

294
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Wait, hold on. What circumstance would they have their jizz bandana out of their house?

295
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,700
We hired a dog walker. We will never hire him again.

296
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
It's a tough job.

297
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Listen, walking a dog is stressful, and sometimes you gotta rub one out.

298
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
While headbanging, I guess.

299
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Dog, I'll take you out in five minutes. Give me a second.

300
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,700
You ever see the back of that Bruce Springsteen album? That's what it was. It was a jizz bandana.

301
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Oh, Jesus.

302
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Recently, a new neighbor moved in across the street from my wife and me.

303
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
My wife took her cookies, and I was building a grill.

304
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,700
No, took her cookies. Not took her cookies.

305
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Welcome to the neighborhood, bitch. Why?

306
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,700
My wife took her cookies until she'd eaten enough salad.

307
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,700
By the way, quick update. Justin ate some field greens for dinner. I watched him. I was so fucking proud of him.

308
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
He also made up the term field greens.

309
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
No, that's a thing.

310
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Field of greens, the movie Field of Greens. Now, hold on.

311
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Before you go any further, I talked about this on Sawbones. Thank you for listening.

312
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Recently, my new neighbor moved in across the street from... I shouldn't say that. He was caring for my infant.

313
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Were we supposed to be doing that?

314
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,700
We're gonna get through this question if it's the last thing we do, everybody.

315
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Do you guys get the part about the new neighbor? Excellent.

316
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I moved in across from my wife, and the wife stole some cookies, and I was building a grill, so I waved from our garage.

317
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Later that week, my wife and I were walking to the bus, and the woman joined us.

318
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,700
She asked my wife if I was her son.

319
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,700
After a few seconds of awkward silence, my wife said, no, this is my husband.

320
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Who should be more offended? Me, who apparently looks like a 12-year-old despite being 31, over six feet tall, and going gray?

321
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Or my wife, who the woman thought must look older than her 30 years.

322
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,700
That's from Mifft and Madison. I have a confession to make.

323
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Yeah! Honestly!

324
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Sorry, we didn't ask... Sorry, that was our fault.

325
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,700
We didn't ask if the person who asked that was in the audience, and so you felt the need to let us know.

326
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Well, what if they don't know it's me? I should say something.

327
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Let me say, that was not a 12-year-old's howl.

328
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,700
When we were going through the questions to talk about during dinner, and I was pretty deeply into my big CD...

329
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Pull back that curtain.

330
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I'm pulling back the curtain.

331
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I heard the line, she asked my wife if I was her son,

332
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:35,700
and what I interpreted it as was the older woman asking if the question asker was her son,

333
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:44,700
and I couldn't think for fucking five minutes. I was like, who are these monsters that I call brothers

334
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
who are making fun of this clearly Alzheimer's stricken woman?

335
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,700
No, because I want it to be like this. Excuse me.

336
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Is that my son?

337
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I don't mean to make this awkward, but...

338
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,700
I think you got my boy.

339
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I see what happened here. You got my boy.

340
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
He got my boy. I want him back.

341
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I need him to do chores and such.

342
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,700
The reason... I was just sitting up here thinking about this.

343
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Sometimes I wish we did music, because I feel like if you're Bon Jovi,

344
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,700
you can look into the crowd and make eye contact with people,

345
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
and it's like a real, real moment for them.

346
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
For doing a comedy podcast, it's just really distracting,

347
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
because they're not going to mouth the words to jokes for you.

348
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Oh, you don't get to do this move?

349
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Yeah, right. What's the next thing I'm going to say?

350
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,700
It's probably dicks or horses or something.

351
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Dick horses. Now you...

352
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
I think somebody actually yelled dick horses.

353
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
So who should be more offended?

354
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Good work, I guess. Well done.

355
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Here's the thing. The person who is the most awesome in this situation

356
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
is the older woman neighbor.

357
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Yeah, she is. Are you kidding me?

358
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
I can't imagine a scenario...

359
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm a 31-year-old adult person.

360
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I can't imagine being that blunt and honest ever

361
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,700
to go, hey, fucking stop.

362
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Is that your son?

363
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Ever.

364
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
I would do this like, how long? What's up?

365
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,700
What is the riskiest, potentially wrongest fucking thing I can say?

366
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Because if it breaks bad, never again.

367
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Never again. You will never steal this woman's cookies ever again.

368
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Maybe that's a countermeasure.

369
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Maybe they were shit cookies.

370
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Listen, I'm not trying to knock. Are you here?

371
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,700
That was a very beaten down yeah.

372
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
I'm so sorry if we've been cruel.

373
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
When your husband had his interaction with her,

374
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
was she like, what are you doing?

375
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
And he was like, I'm making a grill.

376
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Like that and wave like a 12-year-old.

377
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm working in my garage.

378
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
I'm going to cook a steak on it.

379
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm going to cook a steak on it later.

380
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
I'm making a steak.

381
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,700
I don't know how weathers work.

382
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,700
How do you spell steak?

383
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm watching Breaking Bad.

384
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Sorry to interrupt you guys, us.

385
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,700
But I want to take a quick moment to tell you about our sponsors for this episode.

386
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
First up is a returning favorite, Warby Parker.

387
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Remember Warby Parker?

388
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
For fashion forward prescription glasses that start at just 95 bucks.

389
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,700
That sounds cool and that's a great price, but it gets better.

390
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
They have this home try-on program.

391
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I just turned into Greg Brady for a second.

392
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Or Peter Brady. I didn't watch the Brady Bunch.

393
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I don't know. Fuck you.

394
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,700
You can order five pairs of glasses to be shipped directly to your home.

395
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:48,700
You try them on and then you select the ones you want and send them back free with no obligation to purchase.

396
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I wish you turned into Wayne Brady.

397
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Okay.

398
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,700
You get the five, you like two of them, you send three back.

399
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Done.

400
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,700
You yell at the glasses you don't like and you put them in a box, a dark box.

401
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,700
You tie them to a balloon and they float up in the air and then Warby Parker collects them in the clouds.

402
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
That's true because they're angels.

403
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,700
They're cloud-based glasses and you can get them at warbyparker.com slash my brother.

404
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,700
And if you do that, you get free three-day shipping on your final frame choice.

405
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,700
That address again is warbyparker.com slash my brother.

406
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Also sponsoring us this week, Nature Box.

407
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
You know them. You love them.

408
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
One of our favorites.

409
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,700
I guess if this is your first time hearing, first of all, it's probably weird to listen to a live show first.

410
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,700
But zero artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners.

411
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Zero grams trans fat.

412
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
No high fructose corn syrup.

413
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
This is like good shit.

414
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Sup?

415
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Sorry what, Travis? Sorry?

416
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,700
No high fructose corn syrup.

417
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
This is only the good shit.

418
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,700
If any of the words I'm about to say to you sound amazing, you'll want to get down on this.

419
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Sriracha roasted cashews.

420
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,700
I'm jamming on the Asiago cheese crisps right now.

421
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh, god damn.

422
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
They're like the greatest savory snack I've ever had.

423
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
I'm way into parmesan pot pops.

424
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
You two motherfuckers are living under the Tuscan sun.

425
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
That's me.

426
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Diane Lane up in this bitch.

427
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,700
These great snacks are available to you at naturebox.com slash my brother.

428
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,700
If you go there, you can get a free sampler box of great tasting healthy snacks.

429
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
That address again, naturebox.com slash my brother.

430
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Go get some snacks.

431
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
They're great tasting.

432
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
They're healthy.

433
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
They're delicious.

434
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Go get them.

435
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,700
As long as you're feeling hungry, I got another sponsor here to tell you about.

436
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
It's called Blue Apron.

437
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Blue Apron is a service that sends you ingredients and it's like a puzzle.

438
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,700
When you put the ingredients together with the right steps and in the right measurements,

439
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
then you have created a delicious food stuff all by yourself.

440
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
You get to feel like a big adult and then you get to eat a big yummy meal.

441
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
You also figured out who killed JFK.

442
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,700
We're looking at almond crusted cod with blistered sugar snappy salad,

443
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,700
spring ramen ground pork with garlic chives.

444
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
God damn.

445
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Yeah.

446
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Spinach casserole, egg noodles, spinach, orange.

447
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Oh my god.

448
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Travis doesn't even know some of these words.

449
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Spinach.

450
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Peery, peery chicken thighs with coconut plantain mash and collard greens.

451
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Blue Apron's great.

452
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
The meals are balanced.

453
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,700
They're like five to 700 calories per serving and they're very, they're generously portioned

454
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,700
so that you get a lot of food for your money and your calories.

455
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Speaking of generous, here's two free meals for you.

456
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

457
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
We just fed you twice.

458
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
We just gave you two free meals from blueapron.com.

459
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
Teach a listener to fish.

460
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Yeah.

461
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
They'll eat for a day.

462
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Teach a listener to get blue apron.

463
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,700
They'll get two free meals and then pay under less than $10 for the following meals.

464
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Teach a listener to fish and he'll eat for a day and then get bored with fishing and move

465
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,700
on to the next day and be like, wait, oh shit, I should have kept doing that.

466
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm so, so hungry.

467
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I'm so hungry.

468
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,700
I got a message for Andre Schenk here from Isaac Beachy.

469
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,700
He says, hey Andre Schenk, it's Isaac.

470
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
This is crazy, right?

471
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I can get Griffin to say whatever I want.

472
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
No, you can't.

473
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
You can't because I'm reading it.

474
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
You can't buy me nothing.

475
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm drunk on Griffin.

476
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I'm drunk on syrup.

478
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm drunk on power.

479
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I'm Griffin.

480
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,700
I'm a little baby, a little baby that poops.

481
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
This is me.

482
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,700
You can't see me right now, but I'm fucking matrix dodging in front of my microphone like,

483
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
no, no, you don't know.

484
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I'm pooping my pants right now.

485
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Poop, poop, poop all over my pants.

486
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
I think Rush Limbaugh is the greatest.

487
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
I don't believe in global warming yet.

488
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Griffin didn't say that I did.

489
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,700
But it's a shame because I all of that stuff is totally true.

490
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Thank you, Andre.

491
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,700
I guess Isaac didn't have a message for you.

492
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
He just wanted to control me like some sort of meat puppet.

493
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Well, fuck that.

494
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm my own man.

495
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Let's do another message.

496
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,700
This next one is a simple one, and it's a loving one.

497
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,700
It's from a brother, Dan Fowler, to his sister, Victoria Fowler, and his simple message of

498
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,700
love reads, Victoria smells like farts.

499
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Oh, shit.

500
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,700
And then in what I would say one of the most gracious things anyone has ever said about

501
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,700
us, Dan included in the message, that's it.

502
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Perhaps this is below you, gentlemen.

503
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Nope.

504
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Oh, man.

505
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,700
It's not below us all, but Victoria, are you going to stand for that?

506
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
You've got to stand up to him.

507
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Send us $100 to stand up for you.

508
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Let's start a flame war on the Jumbotron.

509
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Again, it is below me, and I didn't say it because I am starting to hold myself to a

510
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
certain standard on this show.

511
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Okay.

512
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Here's the last message.

513
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:29,700
It's for Dan Shriner, and it's from Jobo, who says, hey, Dan Shriner, happy birthday.

514
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,700
This is a loving message from Jobo reaching out to you across space and time courtesy

515
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,700
of a McElroy Brothers vocal cords and mouth movements.

516
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Never forget how awesome you are, and always remember how much your friends and family

517
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
care about you.

518
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Nerd.

519
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
My son.

520
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,700
And he wanted that message to be sent on April 21st, which is a Tuesday, not typically the

521
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:58,700
day that we transmit our love broadcasts to the world around us, but there it is, message

522
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
deployed.

523
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,700
I did it with – there's been a lot this week of people wanting to control our mouths,

524
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
like we're some sort of Jim Henson monstrosity.

525
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Should we get back to the show?

526
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Yes.

527
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Let's do it.

528
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Here's another JaDrew from JaDrew user level 1000 Drew in Drew Davenport.

529
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
Thank you, Drew.

530
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:25,700
It's by JaDrewAnswersUserGuitarMan, who asks, I called a man Bumblefoot, and he was angered.

531
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Oh, man, this is going to take a few tries.

532
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Okay.

533
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Start again, because that's the best sentence I've ever –

534
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm not even through the fucking headline yet.

535
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I called a man Bumblefoot, and he was angered.

536
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
I did it in a friendly way, though.

537
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Was I wrong to do this?

538
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,700
We've all been there.

539
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Hey, Bumblefoot, excuse me.

540
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Sorry?

541
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Bumblefoot, that's our word.

542
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
I got to go now.

543
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Good night, everyone.

544
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Travis out.

545
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,700
30 minutes, and Travis has retired from the stage.

546
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,700
There is a man I know named Ron who lives near me.

547
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:16,700
I was hanging out in the front yard as my brother was cooking burgers on the gweel.

548
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Ron was walking his dog, and as he approached, I said, hello there, Bumblefoot.

549
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,700
I would give anything if that's somebody's stepdad, Ron.

550
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Like, that guy hasn't gone through enough.

551
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Listen, man, I get it enough at home.

552
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
Bumblefoot's already written on my dog.

553
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Leave me alone.

554
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,700
He said, Bumblefoot, what does that mean?

555
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
I am your elder.

556
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Have some respect.

557
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,700
The funny part is that he is only my elder by about six years, as he is 45 and I am 39.

558
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Whoa!

559
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Okay, quick question.

560
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Hey there, Bumblefoot.

561
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Excuse me?

562
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
What's sweeter?

563
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700
I'm a man.

564
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
What's sweeter?

565
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm a Bumble man.

566
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I'm not a Bumble boy.

567
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,700
You call me Bumble, sir.

568
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:25,700
What's better, a 39-year-old person calling another 46-year-old person a Bumblefoot or

569
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,700
a 39-year-old person doing that and saying, I have got to tell Yahoo Answers about this.

570
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,700
You'll never believe what happened to me.

571
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Dear Yahoo Answers, I never believed it would happen to me.

572
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I've called so many people Bumblefoot and nothing has happened.

573
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
This is the least sexy penthouse letter I've ever read.

574
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
I meant for it to be a friendly nickname.

575
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Ron took it the wrong way.

576
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Was I wrong to do this?

577
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,700
So he's been doing some fucking cool searching.

578
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Did you say, was I Ron to do this?

579
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
One of two things has happened.

580
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Okay.

581
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Either he has seen Ron a thousand times and gone, uh, no.

582
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
That's not it.

583
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
No, I can't.

584
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
What is it?

585
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Ramadama ding dong.

586
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Fuck.

587
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Hey.

588
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Oh, no, no.

589
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I'll get it.

590
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
I'll get it.

591
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Or he's been trying out nicknames at Ron and Ron's just walking.

592
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,700
And maybe when he, when Ron was like nine, he got stung by a bee on the foot and a kid

593
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
was like, hey, look at Bumblefoot.

594
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
And Ron was like, no, no.

595
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
What?

596
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
It's like, oh, Bumblefoot.

597
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
And it haunted him through college.

598
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,700
And like a girl would be about to go home with Ron and be like, are you going home with

599
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Bumblefoot?

600
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
And he's like, what?

601
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
No, no.

602
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
That's Bumblefoot.

603
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Wait, this guy's Bumblefoot?

604
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
No way.

605
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Sex canceled.

606
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Griffin, don't interrupt him.

607
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
There has got to be more to this riff.

608
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,700
I have got to get to the end of the vision quest that my brother is taking me on.

609
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,700
I feel like I'm watching a whole John Cusack movie in my head.

610
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
You have got to continue.

611
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,700
So then Ron grew up to be Ron.

612
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,700
He changed his last name to Perlman.

613
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,700
He's been living his whole life as a movie star.

614
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
He's grown outside the Bumblefoot name.

615
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,700
He's made himself Ron Perlman.

616
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Ron Perlman, the 45 year old man.

617
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Sure.

618
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
He hasn't held up well.

619
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
I guess.

620
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,700
It's all the goddamn bee stings.

621
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
Did you just call me Bumblefoot?

622
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,700
I was in Pacific Rim.

623
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh, God.

624
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
It got really sad there at the end.

625
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,700
I didn't think you could make me care about Bumblefoot, but you goddamn did.

626
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,700
You're a real weaver of stories, Travis.

627
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I actually have that written in my notebook upstairs.

628
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,700
It's on my computer too.

629
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,700
You're the Dean Koontz of podcast refs.

630
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
What do you guys want to do?

631
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Let's do one other question and then throw it to the house.

632
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,700
You want a real human question?

633
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Yeah, let's do a real one.

634
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
My friend and I have...

635
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
This is good.

636
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
My friend and I...

637
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Although it's weird if they're here, but I'm going to go for it anyway.

638
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Oh, shit.

639
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I didn't even think about that.

640
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Sorry, pumpkin.

641
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Do it.

642
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
We're already on the bus.

643
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Let's see where it takes us.

644
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,700
My friend and I have recently fallen into a friends with benefits situation.

645
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Right now, someone in this audience is like...

646
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Are you here?

647
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Wait, hold on.

648
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
How many people...

649
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Like 18 people.

650
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Wait, I'm in that.

651
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
That's right.

652
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
That's me.

653
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
I forgot I wrote into you guys, apparently.

654
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,700
The problem is we're both new to this and don't know what benefits are and are not included.

655
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
No dental.

656
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,700
For...

657
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

658
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Damn.

659
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Raw, straight.

660
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
No, just kidding.

661
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Use protection.

662
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:57,700
This message is brought to you by responsibility.

663
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,700
For instance, is it cool to make out and have sexy time?

664
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
But what's not okay?

665
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Please help us clarify our weird, weird friendship.

666
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,700
I think you fucked the reading of that question up eight different ways.

667
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,700
You can't do to each other what Justin just did to that question.

668
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
Okay, here's the beautiful thing.

669
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
Can I finish?

670
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
You can restart and do it better.

671
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Okay.

672
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,700
It's cool to make out and have sexy times, but what's not okay?

673
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Dental.

674
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
No, shit.

675
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Stop, stop, stop.

676
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
I blew it.

677
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Please help us clarify our weird, weird, weird friendship.

678
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,700
That's from Confundled Cuddle Companions.

679
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Oh my God, no.

680
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
Okay, question.

681
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Two questions.

682
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,700
Are you here and are both of you here?

683
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,700
Awesome.

684
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Awesome.

685
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,700
I think they were actually here the first time you read that question.

686
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,700
They fucking were reduced to ash as soon as we started reading this question.

687
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
We can still catch the end of the game if we hurry.

688
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Let's go.

689
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
We're out.

690
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
Here's the awesome thing about friends with benefits.

691
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Oh God.

692
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,700
You've been married for a while.

693
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Griffin, are you getting a score update?

694
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I just wanted to check real quick.

695
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,700
The awesome thing is this, is that it goes against what you would think where it actually

696
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,700
like you can fall on bone, but don't hold hands.

697
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Yeah, it's weird, Trev.

698
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
No, I feel what you're saying.

699
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
That's what makes it so dynamic, so exciting.

700
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Thank you.

701
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,700
It's why they made two fucking movies about it at the same goddamn time.

702
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Starting Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman and, hold on, I got this, I got this, Mila

703
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Kudus and fucking, hold up, I got this, Justin Timberlake.

704
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Yeah.

705
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Because it's the weird bell curve of that, of like if you're friends in a relationship,

706
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,700
friends with benefits, you only get the two sides, but you don't get that middle, you

707
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
don't get that intimacy.

708
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
You don't need that intimacy.

709
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Yeah, it really is like we're boned, bye, and that's totally cool that you-

710
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,700
That second step is so vitally important, but you have to say bye.

711
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,700
But if you're dating and you take it seriously, you can't do that move.

712
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,700
You can't be like, ah, we had a romantic dinner and then we had sex, bye.

713
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,700
You can't do that.

714
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,700
And you shouldn't say it like Borat, like my brother did.

715
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
Bye.

716
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,700
My wife will be home in a couple minutes.

717
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeah, my wife will be home soon, you should go.

718
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,700
This will get weird.

719
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,700
I got to say, I know this is, we're both, this is very exciting, it's very fucking sexual

720
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,700
and it's a very exciting energy that we've injected into our relationship and I just

721
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,700
got to say this whole thing's got me feeling very nice.

722
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
That was fucking horrible.

723
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,700
That was the worst Borat, I've done some pretty good Borat in my years.

724
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Hold on, let's give, we gave Justin a take two, Griffin.

725
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,700
All right, let me try again.

726
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,700
You lost all your consonants.

727
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,700
It sounds like you just got bit by a snake.

728
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Ah, Borat.

729
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,700
We just woke your baby up, for sure, for sure.

730
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
No question.

731
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,700
Should we go throw it to the audience?

732
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
What's the score?

733
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
I can't fucking find it online, apparently people won't give a shit.

734
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Two to eight.

735
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
What?

736
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
No.

737
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Holy shit, tied at half.

738
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Let's get some dogs.

739
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Badgers, yeah.

740
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Anyone here a fan of the Badgers?

741
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Apparently not.

742
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Apparently nobody, like 16 people.

743
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
All right, let's go to the audience.

744
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Here's our rules.

745
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
There's no bummer questions, please.

746
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
No bummers.

747
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
No bummers, we'll know.

748
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,700
And no, it could be a bummer, but it'll be fine.

749
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,700
The first fucking person we had up last night.

750
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Well, it might be, stop it.

751
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,700
They actually quote said, it depends on how you answer.

752
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Don't put that fucking shit on us, dog.

753
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
This is 100% your authorship.

754
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
Own it, own it, stand in your place.

755
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Can we get a little bit of house lights?

756
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
We got them right there, look.

757
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Ma'am, right here, yeah, come right here.

758
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
Yes, you pointing at your head.

759
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Come right to the mic.

760
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
This is the most fucking phantom zone set up.

761
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,700
No, the mic is behind you.

762
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,700
You've been tricked, we're doing this shit like a TED talk.

763
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,700
Like a TED talk, have you seen a TED talk?

764
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,700
Proceed with your question and await judgment.

765
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,700
Just like any TED talk.

766
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Yes, I work in education, I've seen a lot of TED talks.

767
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,700
Okay, fair enough, you just put us in our place.

768
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
What's your name?

769
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
My name is Heather.

770
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Hi, Heather.

771
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
What's your question?

772
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Do you have a question?

773
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,700
My question is, my husband had to move to California for business.

774
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,700
And I'm going to see him for the first time in three weeks on Wednesday.

775
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,700
What should I do when I see him?

776
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I don't know.

777
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Kiss him.

778
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,700
You always come with the best lines, Trav.

779
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
Kiss him on the face.

780
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Tell him you love him.

781
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Here's what I've learned, it's 2015.

782
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,700
If you see someone and you haven't seen them for a while,

783
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,700
and it doesn't go viral, then you don't have anything.

784
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,700
The first thing you should say is, sorry I haven't YouTubed you.

785
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,700
I'm saying like, you YouTubed the reunion.

786
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,700
And if it doesn't have 15 mil by the end of the week,

787
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
apparently your love is not very special.

788
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Do you also have a golden retriever that hasn't seen him in a while?

789
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Do you have a golden retriever that hasn't seen him?

790
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Because you'll be rich.

791
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Huge.

792
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I have a black lab border copy.

793
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Perfect either?

794
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
Good enough.

795
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,700
No, good enough.

796
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
Well, I don't know.

797
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,700
You might go bacterial.

798
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
Good night!

799
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,700
Wait, what?

800
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
I don't understand.

801
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,700
I didn't fucking get it.

802
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
What?

803
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,700
I didn't get the joke.

804
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
That's disgusting.

805
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Lab, like lab?

806
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
Viral.

807
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
Like they do fucking like virus experiments in a lab?

808
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
That was the joke?

809
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
No, like viral bacteria, like it might go viral, anyway.

810
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

811
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,700
Okay.

812
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,700
Fuck.

813
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
Listen, let me ask you this.

814
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
Have you picked up any new skills that you can impress them with?

815
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
What?

816
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Did you learn the yo-yo?

817
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Did you learn the yo-yo?

818
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,700
How quickly can you spray paint?

819
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,700
Can you get up on a, what are you saying?

820
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
Do what with spray paint?

821
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,700
You throw up your tag on a local business?

822
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Now they do that where you make like a pyramid in front of a moon.

823
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,700
It's like you'll never believe what you can do in 15 seconds.

824
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,700
Are you having a stroke?

825
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Did you just, did you just do like an audio visual version of Illuminati like in our podcast?

826
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,700
Hey guys, moon in front of a pyramid.

827
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Get it?

828
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,700
Anyway, let's just move on.

829
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Don't worry about it.

830
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,700
Any, uh, stardom races out there?

831
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Anyway, moving on.

832
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,700
I'm pretty sure when I see him, he's going to tweet everything we do to you guys.

833
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,700
Perfect.

834
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,700
Perfect.

835
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,700
That's-

836
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Give us a big round of applause.

837
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,700
Oh, yeah.

838
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,700
You, sir.

839
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,700
Where?

840
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,700
Where, where, where?

841
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
Right over there.

842
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,700
Over here?

844
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,700
Come on up.

846
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,700
It's over there.

847
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
You're going the wrong way.

848
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,700
You're going the wrong way.

849
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
You're breaking my heart.

850
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,700
Well, okay.

851
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,700
Go away.

852
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,700
You're right.

853
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,700
You're right.

854
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,700
You're right.

855
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,700
No, yeah, yeah.

856
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,700
You're driving this ship of your body.

857
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
You're the captain of your body boat.

858
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,700
You're interspacing this shit.

859
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
No, yeah.

860
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Yeah, just go down there.

861
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,700
You got it.

862
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
You got it.

863
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,700
You took the fucking craziest way you could.

864
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Good job, Marco Polo.

865
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
You're almost there.

866
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Just, you know, circumnavigated the crowd.

867
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Hi.

868
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Okay.

869
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Hello.

870
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Hi.

871
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
How we doing?

872
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Good.

873
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,700
What is your name?

874
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,700
My name is Cole.

875
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,700
Hi, Cole.

876
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,700
How you guys doing?

877
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
Good.

878
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,700
How are you?

879
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,700
I'm good.

880
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
How are you?

881
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,700
I'm nervous as shit.

882
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,700
No, Cole, you need to relax.

883
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,700
What is your question?

884
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,700
You're fine.

885
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
What is your question?

886
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:02,700
Well, it's more of an advice question as far as, in regards to my girlfriend.

887
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,700
Okay.

888
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,700
Is your girlfriend here?

889
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,700
She is.

890
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Yeah, she is.

891
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,700
Where are you, Cole's girlfriend?

892
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Cole's girlfriend coming here.

893
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,700
Yeah.

894
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,700
If you're material to the conversation, I feel like it's only fair if you were also

895
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,700
present.

896
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Yeah.

897
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,700
Everyone let her pass so she doesn't have to do the weird walk around.

898
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Let Cole's girlfriend go through so we can ask the questions simultaneously.

899
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
Sorry.

900
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
Because sometimes I worry that I'm saying heinous shit.

901
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,700
All right.

902
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Cole.

903
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Yes.

904
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Okay.

905
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
What is your question?

906
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
This is my lovely girlfriend, Meredith.

907
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
Hi, Meredith.

908
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
How's it going?

909
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,700
So I have something pretty major that I want to ask her.

910
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,700
What's that, Cole?

911
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,700
In your personal opinion, like, what is the best time to share something just like life

912
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,700
changing and major?

913
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,700
Oh, man.

914
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Right now.

915
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,700
Right now.

916
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
Yeah, I think like pretty much right now would be a good time.

917
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,700
If I was at a comedy podcast, right now would be the moment that I would do that.

918
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
This would be the time, Cole.

919
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Yeah.

920
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,700
Cole, that's, I would do it now.

921
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Oh, shit.

922
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:11,300
I want to hear every word, Cole.

923
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Don't you mumble this.

924
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Don't keep this private.

925
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,300
We made the whole thing public.

926
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,300
Let's do it.

927
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Everyone, hold on, hold on.

928
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,300
Deliver.

929
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,300
I want to hear Cole.

930
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,300
I just want to hear Cole's line.

931
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,300
What do you work up, Cole?

932
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Oh, God.

933
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,460
Baby, I love you so much.

934
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,580
I you mean the world to me.

935
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,020
You're my best friend.

936
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,100
You're my family.

937
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:38,020
And I'm so lucky to share my life with you.

938
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:46,300
I'm excited to absolute silence and I'm also excited to share the rest of my life with

939
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,300
you.

940
00:48:47,300 --> 00:49:00,620
Will you please marry me?

941
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:12,140
Yeah.

942
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,140
Thank you, guys.

943
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,140
Okay, now sit down.

944
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,140
It's our show.

945
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
Next.

946
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,140
No, no, hold on.

947
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

948
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
Don't sit down.

949
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
Now, okay.

950
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,140
Do your thing and then go.

951
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,140
Okay, no.

952
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,140
They're gone.

953
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,140
Okay.

954
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,140
Feel bad for the next.

955
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,880
My roommate's stealing my cottage cheese and I'm really bummed out about it or whatever.

956
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,100
I tried to deploy On the Wings of Love.

957
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,780
Technically, I thought it might fucking accentuate your romantic experience, but it didn't work.

958
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,320
I love this, dude.

959
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Right there.

960
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,420
Oh, I got this.

961
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,420
Yeah.

962
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,420
No.

963
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,500
Let's see what you got.

964
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Yeah, go, go! You're falling off!

965
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,200
You do it! Didn't even waver the ass right!

966
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Yeah, he's gonna keep the show going.

967
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:52,700
Hello.

968
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Hi, what's your name?

969
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,200
Hi!

970
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
My name's William.

971
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
Hey, William.

972
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
They call me Hansel.

973
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,700
H-Hansel? Okay, sure!

974
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,700
That's my last name.

975
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700
That's your last name?

976
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,700
Hansel, okay. Got it.

977
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,200
Hansel, he's still home on it now.

978
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Yeah, thank you.

979
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,200
I, uh, I emailed you about my question, and I had the exact same question as Cole.

980
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Oh, okay, fuck! Back to back!

981
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
What?!

982
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,200
Double barrel!

983
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Shotgun!

984
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Is your girlfriend or boyfriend here?

985
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Yes, she is.

986
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Could she come up to the microphone, please?

987
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Fuck!

988
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Yes!

989
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Ask it! Ask it!

990
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Will you marry me and stuff?

991
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
I have a second question.

992
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Never mind, it's all good.

993
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Thank you so much.

994
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Congratulations, everybody!

995
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
Yeah!

996
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Fuck it! Fuck it! Anybody else?

997
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Anybody else?

998
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Yeah, you! Fuck it!

999
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,200
You, get over there!

1000
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Who else wants to get engaged? Tonight!

1001
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
I'm not fucking kidding!

1002
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Only marriages now! Only marriages!

1003
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Fuck comedy, fuck advice, we're getting fucking married!

1004

Everybody here tonight!

1005
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Where's your girlfriend or boyfriend?

1006
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Well, sh- well, shit, um...

1007
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Don't you fucking step on my- I'm on a fucking groove right now!

1008
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
Come on!

1009

I can do fucking anything!

1010
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,200
What do you got?

1011
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Well, shit, I didn't think you were saying who else wanted to get engaged.

1012
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Yeah, of course, that's what I-

1013
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,200
That's too bad, sir! You're getting engaged tonight!

1014
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Pick someone from the crowd!

1015
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Do we have any tributes who will be engaged to this man?

1016
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,200
I thought we had a streak going.

1017
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Tell us about... whatever...

1018
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,200
What are you doing, Travis? He's not gonna get engaged, okay? It's over.

1019
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,200
The streak's over. You can stop filming the audience.

1020
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,200
Shhh! Three would have gone viral! Yes, I agree with you, Travis!

1021
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Three proposals would have gone viral!

1022
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
I'm still holding out hope!

1023
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Did anybody video both of them so we can get viral something?

1024
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah, congratulations! Get that onto the tube soon, okay?

1025
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Congratulations to everybody, by the way!

1026
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Okay, so sorry!

1027
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Wait!

1028
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Wait, are you looking at your girlfriend right now, boy?

1029
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Huh? Can you?

1030
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
I'm looking at my girlfriend right now and saying,

1031
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Do you wanna get engaged, Travis?

1032
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,200
What a great time to have that conversation!

1033
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
Oh, she's coming up!

1034
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Hold on! She's coming up!

1035
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Holy shit! She's coming up to the microphone!

1036
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,200
You two, listen! Listen, look at me right now. Listen to me for a second.

1037
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
What's up?

1038
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,200
This world is hard.

1039
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Shut up. This world is hard.

1040
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,200
And if you find somebody that you wanna wake up every morning and look at,

1041
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,200
then you grab that person and you cling to him.

1042
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
And you never let go.

1043
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
You're the person that I wanna spend your life with.

1044
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Madam, if you don't feel that way about this gentleman,

1045
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
know that this isn't binding.

1046
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
We have lots of other dudes here.

1047
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
We can put you with any one of them.

1048
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
There's a lot of fish in the sea.

1049
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
There are a lot of fish in this room.

1050
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,200
If you find the person that completes you, don't waste another second.

1051
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Devote the rest of your life to them.

1052
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Have you heard the good news?

1053
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:52,200
We cannot express enough how viral the three-peat will go.

1054
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
I don't wanna break shit justice flow,

1055
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
but Travis, you're filming this in a vertically angled video

1056
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
and it's fucking killing me.

1057
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah, Travis.

1058
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Thank you. Yes.

1059
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Thank you. Turn this to the side for us.

1060
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,200
Okay. Okay.

1061
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Sir. Madam.

1062
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
What do you got for us?

1063
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Can we cook up a three-peat?

1064
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Do you wanna break traditional gender norms?

1065
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Oh, shit!

1066
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
What?

1067
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,200
A progressive three-peat!

1068
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
A three Patricia.

1069
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
If you will.

1070
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
That's pretty good.

1071
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
This is so spec...

1072
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Listen, don't...

1073
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
No, now I'm starting to feel very, very guilty.

1074
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
I'm starting to feel guilty.

1075
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
We only vetted the first one.

1076
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Why don't you guys commit to something less big right now?

1077
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Like a weekend duet.

1078
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Where do you go on a three-day weekend with me?

1079
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Do you wanna commit to something less?

1080
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Do you wanna go on vacation this summer?

1081
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
Do you wanna go to the Wisconsin belt?

1082
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Do you wanna go to Flood Rockers?

1083
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
We gotta pivot our brand real quick.

1084
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
You two are currently living through the most uncomfortable moments of your lives

1085
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
and we're gonna get you through it.

1086
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,200
We're gonna get you through it alive.

1087
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,200
Tomorrow's gonna come and you're not even gonna remember it.

1088
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
This is not the only moment in time.

1089
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
It's gonna keep going on and you won't always be standing there.

1090
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,200
You're not locked to anything that's happening right now.

1091
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,200
You'll just be up here doing a podcast.

1092
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
We did have our first date in approximately this spot.

1093
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
A week ago.

1094
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,200
I'll give you a free poster if you ask him to marry you.

1095
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
That's fucked up. Come on. What the fuck?

1096
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,200
You don't need a goddamn poster dowry.

1097
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
I'll give you a poster and a chest of jewels.

1099
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,200
This is turning on me. We have geese for you.

1100
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Mr. Travis McElroy.

1101
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Yes, sir.

1102
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Magnet or no deal?

1103
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
It's pretty funny.

1104
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
It was a $3.50 magnet.

1105
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Am I willing to marry two people for $3.50?

1106
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
I'm looking at my wife.

1107
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Oh no, she ducked away from the window.

1108
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
I'm gonna say yes.

1109
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh, now it's on.

1110
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Didn't think I'd give up the magnet.

1111
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Travis has called your $3 bluff.

1112
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
It's high stakes here, my brother.

1113
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
My brother and me, Milwaukee.

1114
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,200
We've been standing up here for maybe...

1115
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200
Yeah, for 100,000 years.

1116
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,200
You need to pop or get off the pot.

1117
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Please do not let yourself be goaded into a marriage by a podcast.

1118
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
You're better than this.

1119
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,200
And if you do, let it be a better podcast.

1120
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Right.

1121
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,200
I would let Superego let me get married, but not us.

1122
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,200
If Night Vale told me to get married, I would do it, and I'm already married.

1123
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Why don't you think about it?

1124
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Think about it, and the next time we're in Milwaukee, you can propose then.

1125
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
In six years, you can propose again.

1126
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
Can we have a big round of applause?

1127
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,200
Thank you, Lighting Guy.

1128
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
That's sweet.

1129
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
For the record.

1130
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
For the record.

1131
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,200
I promised I wouldn't embarrass you in front of 600 people.

1132
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Fucking great job, Dom.

1133
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
How'd that go?

1134
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
How'd that go?

1135
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,200
The worst job.

1136
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
It is her birthday today.

1137
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Okay, wait, hold on.

1138
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
We can at least do this.

1139
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,200
Happy birthday.

1140
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
No, we cannot.

1141
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
No, no, no, no.

1142
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,200
We don't have the rights.

1143
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
So, happy birthday.

1144
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
You did it.

1145
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Another year.

1146
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Congratulations.

1147
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
What's your name?

1148
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
Becky.

1149
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
Becky?

1150
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,200
Becky!

1151
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,200
That's the first jingle in four years.

1152
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Yeah.

1153
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
Listen.

1154
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
We got...

1155
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
We done?

1156
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
Yeah.

1157
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
We have one more question from...

1158
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Thank you all.

1159
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
You've been great.

1160
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Give them a big round of applause.

1161
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
I think we're done.

1162
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
Listen.

1163
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
What?

1164
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Let's end it.

1165
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Yeah.

1166
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Listen, guys.

1167
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Thank you all so much.

1168
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
Thank you to Turner Hall for being so kind to us.

1169
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Yeah.

1170
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,200
Thank you, Milwaukee.

1171
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
Thank you for missing the game to be with us and hang out.

1172
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,200
Thank you for being such a cool city and being so nice to us.

1173
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Also, I want to say thank you to Justin Gray.

1174
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Justin Gray designed some awesome show-specific posters.

1175
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Yeah.

1176
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,200
They say this...

1177
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Like, they're only for sale here at this show,

1178
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
and they are about this show, so...

1179
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,200
So, it shows the venue and the city, and get them.

1180
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,200
Get them.

1181
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
They're fucking rad.

1182
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
We stole some already.

1183
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
They're available right back there.

1184
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Yeah.

1185
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Do that.

1186
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Uh...

1187
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
John Rodgers?

1188
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
Thank you, John Rodgers,

1189
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
in the long winter to do these sort of things.

1190
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,200
I'm putting the days to bed.

1191
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Thank you to Sawbones for opening for us and being so amazing.

1192
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Thank you to the person who gave us this bottle that was full

1193
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
like an hour and a half ago.

1194
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Comedy Juice.

1195
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Thank you, Comedy Juice.

1196
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
From Repeal Reserve.

1197
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,200
Delicious.

1198
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,200
Delicious stuff.

1199
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
Thank you to our wives who aren't in Sawbones,

1200
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Teresa and Rachel, for being so amazing.

1201
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,200
So fucking rad.

1202
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Thank you so much.

1203
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,200
Final Yahoo from my brother Griffin.

1204
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,200
We're going to think about this, and we'll come back to it next week

1205
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,200
and talk about it like we always do.

1206
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Shut up.

1207
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,200
This final Yahoo was sent in by Samuel Ginsberg.

1208
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Thank you, Samuel.

1209
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jason, who asks,

1210
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,200
What religion are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

1211
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
My name is Justin McElroy.

1212
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1213
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1214
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1215
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1216
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
Hey.

1217
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,200
I wanted to remind you about Blue Apron.

1218
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Thank you so much to them for helping make this show possible.

1219
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,200
You can get your first two meals for free by going to

1220
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,200
BlueApron.com slash my brother.

1221
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
We also want to say thanks again to NatureBox,

1222
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,200
where you can order hundreds of great tasting snacks,

1223
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
healthy snacks.

1224
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Go to NatureBox.com slash my brother to sign up

1225
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,200
for your free sample box of great tasting, healthy snacks.

1226
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
And one more time, if you live in the Pacific Northwest,

1227
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,200
Seattle, Portland, or Vancouver, or anywhere around there,

1228
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
we're going to be doing a live show there,

1229
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
live shows, I should say, in each city.

1230
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
At the end of August, you can get tickets,

1231
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
everything you need to know at bit.ly

1232
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
forward slash MBMBAM Portland,

1233
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,200
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle,

1234
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,200
and bit.ly forward slash van, V-A-N, MBMBAM.

1235
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
And just so you know, the Seattle show corresponds

1236
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
with PAX, but it is not PAX affiliated,

1237
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
so you still have to buy tickets,

1238
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,200
even if you already have passes to PAX.

1239
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
But you don't need a pass.

1240
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
You don't need a pass to pass.

1241
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,200
It's a totally separate thing.

1242
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
Anyway, yeah, thanks for listening.

1243
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Okay, bye.

1244
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Maximum fun dot org.

1245
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
