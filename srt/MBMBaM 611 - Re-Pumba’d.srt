1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,420
Hello everybody welcome my brother my brother me and advice you for the imaginary. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,140
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,380
Have a question for you guys, you know

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,300
Wait, what is it? Say the question? First of all, calm down. Okay, I'll say the question calmly

12
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,780
In a way that we can that we will be able to understand it. Yeah

13
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,540
Well, so I have an icebreaker so that we can kind of get to know each other love that gum

14
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,260
Yeah, I have some gum for you guys and also a question

15
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,520
Um, would you rather? Oh, I love a friend

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,980
These are so devilish

17
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,820
Mm-hmm, but friend a I'm gonna say like magical alien who's just trying to get home a man

18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,980
Oh, yeah, that's kind of a hat on a hat. Don't you think? Well, you don't like ET had like

19
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,380
It was like they said he's not magical enough. He has to have powers too, which is wild

20
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,140
But like a magical alien

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,140
That's like sci-fi like that's sci-fi. That's just his like

22
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,020
Science physiology. Yeah. Okay, so it's not magic. Well, how would you put it?

23
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,260
His sci-fi physiology his body can do different stuff. Okay an alien with abilities

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,420
How about that? Like when you see a goose fly in the air? Are you like, whoa, I can't do that magic

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,300
Okay, so an alien who's trying to get home like it's just his body can do

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,220
Or or a ghost trying to solve its own murder

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,180
I mean ghosts that is kind of magic cuz it's not real

28
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,420
well

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,500
Like as far as you know alien could be real the alien that's like touches a boo-boo and it makes it go better

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,780
That could definitely be yeah, but if you've just never seen a bird and I tell you about a bird flying you're like, that's not real

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,980
No, I know but if the bird dies and then the bird you see the spirit of the bird fly out of it

32
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,040
I would be like that. How's that real? Well within the world of the would you rather Griffin?

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,700
I'm trying to expand your horizons. You don't have to think about

34
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,980
I guess I would do the alien cuz that could be real and the ghost couldn't be real. No, that's the wrong answer

35
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,500
Well juice didn't even get a chance to I guess. Oh, yeah, I didn't even get a chance to listen to the question

37
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Okay, so would you rather?

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,780
Kill someone and have them solve their own murder or kill an alien who's trying to get home. Is the alien bad? I

39
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,620
This is Justin's question. I

40
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,460
Didn't really you didn't specify that before individual people you didn't ask enough questions. Is it the ghost?

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:40,660
Well, so Griffin is on one side of the equation. I was trying to help solve the murder. Yeah, I want to say right now

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,300
That in today's day and age and everything and you and look around you. I don't feel like killing anything

43
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,020
Yeah, I'm being a pure love and peace. I would not kill either of these creatures. Okay

44
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,180
We'll cross it then instead of Griffin helping either the ghost of the alien and Justin hurting the ghost the other would you rather?

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,640
Griffin help the ghost try to solve its own murder or kill an alien who's trying to get home or Justin

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,600
would you rather you kill someone to have the ghost solve its own murder or

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Or help an alien trying to get home

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,320
But I killed it first cuz it took home state secrets. Are you are you pitting me against Griffin? Yeah

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,160
Yeah, so I'm sort of a government bad guy

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,700
Yeah

51
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,680
And I I know the alien stole some dates states secrets and it's gonna take him back to his home planet to try to fuck

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,420
Us up. I don't think so chick chick. That's my

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Gun. Yeah

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,160
That your alien is everyone the alien is now dead

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,000
No, I was I didn't get to make a sound. Oh, you're too slow. Oh

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Oh, you bounced off my armor. Oh, I made armor from detritus around my home

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh some spaceship detritus. I can't juice. Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait juice. Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait

58
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,860
Justin no, shush. Just Justin can't be like

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,640
Listen to me because I'm gonna make it beautiful and poignant. What if you had the armor on under your shirt?

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, yeah, and I see the alien and I'm like, give me back my secrets

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,960
and I just open a clip on his

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,680
Booty, but then you jump in the way and I think oh I killed my brother

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm so sad, but then you stand up and you're like, it's okay. I was protected by the armor and it's like crash

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:38,320
And it's like whoa, that's that's now we're in Oscars territory or or back to the future to territory

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,320
but in the in the distraction that you've caused the area dig get to go home with his with this with all the state's secrets and

66
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Like a month later, we are gonna get invaded and it's gonna be bad news

67
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,680
No one's helping the ghost solve its own murder just to check. It's not real is though is the only thing I think

68
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
I see on the same page

69
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,640
It was a trick question because the ghost was also trying to kill the alien and the ghost snuck on board the ship

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,600
Okay, what are what? Okay. Can we start recording now? Yeah, this has been this has been recording button

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
It's been important stuff. We've done so far

72
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,880
Do you feel that way?

73
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Yeah, cuz I think we're sort of coming up with some really big ideas. Oh

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,080
My and asking the big questions. Yeah. Oh my god. This is an advice show and

75
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,580
We are now if I should check the calendar. What is the ETA time time to the TT?

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
MVB

77
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Just a quick check most valuable brother is that he said no trying to keep us locked in with the

78
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,440
Like the just time stream like to fix us in time. Yeah, it is

79
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,760
We're releasing this episode on the let's see

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
23rd

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,640
23rd. Okay. It is now one calendar month to man vs. B. So that's where we're

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,380
I thought hey, here's a something I fucked up on

83
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:06,520
Mm-hmm speaking of MVB, which well, I just wanted to need to do a little bit because I fucked up. Yeah, I uh, I

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,740
I um, I heard that there was a

85
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,680
Mr. Bean Tony box, you know Tony's they're creative Tony's

86
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,840
Yeah, a little action figures and you put them on top of these boxes and they tell you stories. Oh, yeah

87
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, so I got one because I've been

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,960
letting to Cooper choose one if she sleeps there a bed all night, she gets one to play with and

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
I

90
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Got her one from the UK. This mr. Bean and it tells mr. Bean stories. It's a big problem

91
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,240
No, it's a problem because it does songs. It's just song. Ah

92
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,400
And she has recently told me informed me that mr. Bean is her favorite singer. Oh, no

93
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
yeah, so I'm hearing a

94
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,560
a lot a lot a lot a lot of mr. Bean's

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Hit tune wait so Ron over on this end. Yeah, that's how things I just need to check Justin

96
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,400
Are these actual songs related to mr. Bean or is it just like you plug it in and it plays some music?

97
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,940
Mr. Bean is just the trigger. Oh, that's such an interesting question Travis. He sings songs

98
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,120
That are about being mr. Bean. Oh, wow

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
but

100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:27,840
He doesn't really sing. He just says his name quite a bit. Oh cool. He's not very verbose as a character

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,440
That's not he's much more of a physical presence. Okay. Oh look, I have a sample of one. I can share with you guys

102
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Oh boy, is this hold on? Wait a little bit. Yeah, are we getting into summer jam 2022 territory?

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,320
This might be the summer jam of 22. Oh my god this shit 21 million views. Okay ready? Yeah, we go

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
ready

105
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,840
Do you get what we're going that is incredible as a good song? Yeah now imagine I gave a four-year-old the ability

106
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,480
With my actions I my purchases my evening. I have the four-year-old ability to make that play. Yeah, literally any moment

107
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,800
Yeah that she chooses by placing mr. Bean on top of her Tony box

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you feel like by the way, she will because it's there her favorite singer

109
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,640
Yeah here when you hear that so I'm Justin you feel like transported to like a really I'm gonna say almost too trendy

110
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,600
underground like English nightclub and that song plays and everyone

111
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,280
Unironically loses their shit and like really goes for it because that's what it transported me. That's what I felt like too

112
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,920
yeah, there were too many hula hoops and you know a lot of neon and

113
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,920
and clothes that don't seem like clothes and then that song comes on and everyone's dancing and I'm there because like a friend invited me

114
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,440
There and I've never been to a place like this and I'm like what the fuck is this song and I kind of laugh and but

115
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,720
When I laugh everyone looks at me and they're like, this isn't why are you laughing? I'm grew. I'm grooving

116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,480
I'm shaking so hard. I'm shaking so hard right now. Is that what you feel like in your own home one month?

117
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,080
Until MVB I am curious how you all have been sort of preparing and I don't know about y'all

118
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Netflix says is is having some ish issues with retention. Yeah, and they're having a lot of cancellations and it's like guys

119
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,080
You're you're just gonna come back in a month and you're not gonna be grandfathered in to those good subscription rates

120
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,800
You know what? I mean? Like you're gonna come crawling fucking back in one month

121
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm never letting go my subscription by the way

122
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm still getting DVDs in the mail whenever I want they can't get rid of that because he's in my contract

123
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm getting three a week as long as I watch them and return them on time. There's not a fucking thing they can do

124
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm still hold on to a copy of Stuart little too and they have said nothing about it because Netflix is really cool and my

125
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,840
Friend. Yeah, they're like so chill about every yeah facet of their business

126
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,520
Like everything that they do

127
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,160
Do you guys want to hear the some of the comments on the pizza bean video that mr. Bean did where he made pizza in

128
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,660
A video. Oh sure. I was looking for the pizza bean song. I couldn't find it. That's a shame but comment. Yeah, I feel that

129
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,260
Mr. Bean is the best. He makes me laugh so hard on every single video that he does

130
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,900
I love mr. Bean because he makes me laugh out loud

131
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,540
God bless you. Mr. Bean

132
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,580
This is the best thing I say all day. I love mr. Bean always makes me laugh. God bless and protect mr. Bean

133
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,900
You made my child of mr. Bean when you first are reading those Justin

134
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,800
I had confused what you had said and I thought those were comments by mr. Bean on mr. Bean videos

135
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,780
And for a second, I was like, wow, there's some powerful marketing choices another great one Rowan

136
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,660
You've done you've done it again. Should we do a live stream?

137
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
I've watched my whole

138
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:13,020
How to capitalize on I mean, let's talk a little bit of MVB because it's been a little bit

139
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,860
Yeah, it's been like and it's really one of the things that makes me genuinely so happy

140
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,720
To talk about I feel like the best version of it. Yeah is us like

141
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,100
live-streaming us watching

142
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,820
Yes, all of and you can tune it. You can tune it. We can make a day of it

143
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
How many episodes at ten episodes, huh?

144
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,780
Is it all dropping at once or is it like weekly releases don't tease me mr. Bean

145
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,940
You can't tease me mr. Bean I can't wait that long you can't leave me on cliffs between each one

146
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,460
I'm hanging there waiting for the beans to drop. I'll die. I'll die. I'll have a little heart attack

147
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,060
Like is he gonna win is the be gonna win? I don't know you can't you got it

148
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,140
Paired for the seven episode seven turn when you're like, maybe I want the B to win

149
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,260
You know that's fucking coming right anybody's not rooting for the B from the start is out of there

150
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,860
There is no I'm gonna call it. There's no way they're still fighting at the end of it by the end of it

151
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,940
They have to unite against hornets or something

152
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,540
But at the end of the day bees endangered

153
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,140
Mr. Bean, that's a good point. Mr. Beans, they come and go but we need these little guys these little buzzy boys

154
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,060
I am very very excited to announce that

155
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,460
The the top result for me. I would to see if there's a trailer yet the top result for man versus be

156
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,340
It on YouTube. It's a is it my brother my brother me and a manic by crafty salad. So hey, thank you for that

157
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,680
We got that. Thank you. Should we do the regular show though?

158
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,740
Yeah, I guess I I just we're so close, you know, we're so I can taste it

159
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,520
I will say it's weird that it's a month out and there's still not a single

160
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,180
promotional image or video or anything

161
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,340
Yeah for this thing other than that one incredible poster. That's all you need baby. I

162
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
guess that's all you need but

163
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,480
I've been mr. Bean. Let's hear your bean. No, I'll hear it later. Okay

164
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,900
There it is, I when they did NFTs my tweet was my non fungible friend and I don't think

165
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Fucking that's I enjoy that

166
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,100
But it's great. Yeah, that's the thing that's gonna get me going again. I have this question that's been haunting me

167
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,380
Huh for years when I was a kid. I went to a house showing with my parents and during it

168
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,260
I really had to go to the bathroom

169
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,460
So I asked my mom if I could use the bathroom of the place that we were seeing

170
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,300
I don't even remember if I did or if I was allowed but now as an adult who's looking for places to live now

171
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm wondering can you use the bathroom at places you're seeing should you?

172
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
That's from Nathan. I mean

173
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,700
What what what it's like Nathan what Nathan?

174
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,900
Listen, if you're gonna live in a place

175
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,980
You're gonna make messes in it. Do you know what I mean? Like thank you when you live in a house

176
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,820
What are you gonna do go back to your old house to make messes cuz you know it and know that it's good for you

177
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
You gotta take a test drive

178
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,780
Oh, yeah, you can't I'm kidding. Listen. I can't even kid around here

179
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,540
Yeah, you absolutely have to use the bathroom. Yeah, like you have to there are in the house

180
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,340
Right like three things that you're gonna spend them

181
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,180
but like your bedroom where you sleep your kitchen where you make food and your toilet where you make messes and

182
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,780
Like if any one of those three is like you get in there and like oh actually I hate this

183
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:01,300
I hate this and you don't find that out until after you paid for the house. That's that's the wrong time to read

184
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,220
Cuz maybe you sit down you're like, oh, you know what?

185
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,860
This counter is actually a little close to this. I feel like I'm pinned in here

186
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,780
Oh, you know actually the toilet paper dispensers a little bit too far away and I gotta like lean forward to reach it

187
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,300
What if it's one of those things where this toilet seat won't stay up?

188
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,460
Oh, I like hold it with one hand while you do the your your stand-up business with the other hand

189
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,660
All right. Well, that's why I just don't I don't you stand up. Do y'all remember the first house that we bought?

190
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,700
Where there was a fucking Harry Potter bathroom like Harry Potter under the stairs bathroom

191
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:33,980
Yeah

192
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,340
that you had to like scooch into and kind of lean backwards cuz the you imagine my

193
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,100
Horror my abject horror after I'd signed a deed to say yes, this is my bathroom

194
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,660
Yeah, and I sat in there and tried to use that bathroom. Can you imagine my abject terror as my knees bump the wall?

195
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,940
Oh, yeah, that was I felt like I was on a American Airlines flight

196
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,580
That was a bad that was a bad situation the first apartment that Teresa and I lived in together and grant we did not buy the

197
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,020
house but

198
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,540
There was one bathroom in the apartment

199
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,940
But then they said but in case if there's like an emergency

200
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,980
You have to use there is a toilet in the basement that toilet while connected and fully functional was just stand like in the middle

201
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,100
Of a room there was no it was like some fucking Frank Lloyd Wright like this is like a desert

202
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,500
There's no walls kind of shit. We're just like if it's an emergency and you gotta go. Yeah, just right there

203
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,180
Do you guys remember the first apartment?

204
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:36,220
I moved into in Huntington up in the West Virginia building where I didn't realize this like when we signed up for it

205
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,940
but it came it came with dookie man and

206
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,780
Sorry, what when the bathroom you remember? Do you remember the first apartment? I yes. Yes

207
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,660
Yes building. Yeah, and then you were high there once and a talkable. Yeah, that was a good day

208
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,260
Once but then during that visit. Did you go to the bathroom and see dookie man?

209
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,860
No, I don't think so. Oh, you didn't you didn't see him and now that I remember bad news. He saw you. Oh

210
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,660
Really? I can't believe you don't remember dookie, man. He's just he was there always and

211
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,420
He was bad like a guy that lived in your bathroom. Is that you're telling me?

212
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,540
Um guys not though. He had human qualities, I guess. Yeah

213
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,740
But he would he was there. He other people saw him like your roommates on. I don't know if they ever

214
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,060
I know I should send them

215
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,380
I need to reconnect with those boys on Facebook messenger and say like hey fun times we had in that apartment

216
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Too bad about dookie, man

217
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,740
But they never mentioned him. You just assumed that if they saw they were keeping it to themselves

218
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,340
Yeah

219
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,460
Okay, believe you guys don't remember dookie man. No, I was there a lot. I used the bathroom quite a few times

220
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,380
It'd be a lot more fun if you remembered dookie man, and you could help me kind of flesh him out a little bit

221
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,180
Well, I think that the name was off-putting. Yeah. Oh, well that was I mean, he didn't tell me his name

222
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,340
You absolutely need to use the bathroom here. I want to move on. Okay

223
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,820
The wizard has one for us if we are good with that

224
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Sure. Yeah. Yeah

225
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,900
All right. Cool. Yeah, cool Glenn sent this in. Thank you, Glenn

226
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,260
It's this is and this one's like actionable I think for like most folks all the time. Okay

227
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,500
It's how to interpret a dream involving seals. Thank you. And this is first of all, he's singing

228
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,180
Lovely animal. I tried to get ahead of it. Did you hear how I tried to get ahead of it?

229
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,900
Like right away, I'll try to still got in there to scoop it. No, we're talking about the little blubbery boys known as seals

230
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,340
or sea dogs

231
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
Dream interpretation can be complicated

232
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,980
Usually the most important meaning of a dream is the meaning that's important to you as an individual. I don't yes

233
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,300
I don't like that. I feel like it should be pretty objective. There should be a chart. There should be a chart

234
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,040
There's really only two dream interpretations, right?

235
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,760
And one it's either you are anxious or you are not anxious and it's one of those two and if you break it down by that

236
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,980
It's pretty easy to see which one's which right? Yeah. Yeah, it's more gradients of how anxious are you right exactly?

237
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,580
That's really it. Either. You're either you're like you're several different degrees of anxious

238
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,900
Yeah, or maybe you get to chill out and fly. Yeah

239
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,700
You had an okay day or you had a normal day

240
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,540
Can I Henry had a nightmare the other day about

241
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,020
Zombies, he's had that one quite a bit lately. Yeah, and

242
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:30,760
He was like, but I had superpowers. Oh, I was like, oh cool. And he's like nice but the superpowers had to load

243
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh

244
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Shit, that's so good. That's so choice

245
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,480
Okay, so record the details write them all down

246
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,700
If you want to interpret the dream, you need to record the details you wait

247
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm talking about waking up in a cold sweat and turning on the light and your wife is like, what are you doing?

248
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,600
You know, like I have to I have to write this down. I had a dream and

249
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,520
The lead singer of matchbox 20 was there and he got mad at me. What does it mean?

250
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:02,320
You're you're anxious today and okay jot down everything you remember track specifics like colors shapes sounds words

251
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,280
And so on they were seal sounds and shapes the shape of a seal the sound of a seal

252
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,960
Do you think it's better or worse if the seal makes seal sounds or if the seal speaks in like human voice?

253
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
Hi, thanks for coming. Yeah. Hey, hey

254
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,360
Good. What's up? I know you think this is a dream, but I'm telepathically connecting to you. Could you bring me some fish?

255
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,600
I

256
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,320
Love the aquarium, you know, but nearby if you could just come down. No, don't wake up yet. Say yes

257
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,280
You're a human. You're a human, right? Yeah, where's all the ice land going? Yeah, I used to

258
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,400
Love it there and it's all going away. Is everything okay? I have to assume it's humans

259
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
You guys are way more worried about this than us, right?

260
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,800
You guys got to be freaking out doing everything you can to fix this shit, right because like I'm a seal and my seal brain

261
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,400
Comprehends that there's an issue. So you with your human brains you guys got to be like really freaking out

262
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,960
Are you talking to me? Why are you sleeping? You got thumbs and computers and stuff, right and don't be wrong

263
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,000
It's right making the whales go extinct. We love that

264
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,680
I should admit right now the temperatures that's caused by our farts. Yeah, don't tell anybody

265
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,080
But I see you guys every day fighting those big metal animals that spit out all that stuff

266
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,880
You guys killed them yet. You guys seem to be all those fighting. I'm just so awesome. Okay record your feelings

267
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
That's the same. I felt like a seal. I saw I saw the seal

268
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,920
It sounded like Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 and I felt sad

269
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,120
A little bit happy because it was Rob Thomas. I'm a big fan. Sure

270
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,840
Sure, sure. The next step is identify your thoughts, which is literally the same thing

271
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,540
No feelings and thoughts are different driven

272
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:49,900
Okay fan if in the dream you saw a seal and you felt anxious, but you thought oh fuck is that Rob Thomas?

273
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,140
That's right different things, right a band of seals played me matchbox 20s

274
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:01,440
Unwell, and if I felt sad, but I thought it was badass. Yeah. Yeah two different things pretty badass song

275
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,480
It is really is think about your personal role in the dream

276
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,140
Oftentimes we are not ourselves in our dreams. You may find that you are playing a role. You would not normally play in life

277
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,740
I was like I was the drummer of matchbox 20 and normally I'm the guitarist

278
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,980
For example, you may be aggressive in your dream while you tend to be non confrontational in real life

279
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,860
I'm gonna get you dream seal. I'm gonna get you and fuck you up dream seal

280
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,780
Please don't kill you killed my dad dream seal

281
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,060
Think about how you felt so far. We have not talked about seals in this article. That's the point

282
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:39,100
I think we have a lot so let's begin that now looking for potential meanings consider the potential symbolism of seals

283
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,460
most

284
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,180
Symbolism and dreams is highly personal

285
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,140
However, no one is completely unaware of culture and the cultural meanings or associations that are often attached to images like seals

286
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,820
Yeah, Justin, why don't you tell me some one thing that seals represent again object not to you

287
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,060
But just sort of archetypically speaking us just like just like um

288
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Tricks yeah

289
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,220
Yeah, that's one thing that I feel like

290
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Yeah, they do a trick with a ball

291
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,220
Sometimes they jump up into passers-by's kayaks and they're like you got to get me the fuck out of here, man

292
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
And that's great. We love that

293
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,220
Travis yeah, see what do I think?

294
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,860
What's the seal mean to you?

295
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,060
sperm

296
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Yeah, yeah, sorry sperm cuz they're like slippery wigglers and they're swimming quickly all over the place and I

297
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,100
I think sperm whales eat them and that's a connection in my brain, too. I'm not sure though

298
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,540
Maybe sperm I think if you walk into the daily therapist's office and he's like, so what's up?

299
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,700
You're like I had a dream about seals which of course means sperm. Maybe I okay. We're done for the day

300
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,300
It doesn't mean it doesn't actually say that I'm actually writing you a prescription. I know the exact pill

301
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,580
For you. I know the exact pill that's gonna fix this for you because we've heard this well, what's it mean?

302
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,900
What's this? What's the seal represent to you Griffin? Yeah, well, I've already read the wiki how article

303
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
So I'm tainted

304
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,420
See lions would that have been a better answer that they're basically this seal is just short for sea lion

305
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,220
Yeah, there is a certain duality in seals that can be symbolic while seals live in the ocean

306
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,620
They can also come up on land a seal in a dream may suggest confusion regarding one's place in the world

307
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,540
Do you think that when see you sorry author of this article? Do you think when seals go up on land?

308
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
They're like what the fuck am I doing?

309
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,620
I'm caught between two worlds. This is stupid. This is stupid. I look at my I have fins

310
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,580
Look at the way I try to walk with my not feet. What the fuck am I doing up here?

311
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,460
They're excellent swimmers able to navigate water a seal in a dream may have something to do with the ability to go with the flow

312
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,980
Of life if you felt overwhelmed recently a seal in a dream can be representative of a longing for more control. That's good

313
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,220
Hey, you guys want to hear something? It's weird and fucked up and true

314
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,580
Yeah, the difference between seals and sea lions is they have ear flaps or not

315
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,140
no

316
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,860
Seal is sure for your line. Say see you Travis. They see you lying outside out loud

317
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,400
See you outside go outside. Okay, hold on and say see you lying out loud, but don't say I am

318
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,740
Okay, yeah, I get it

319
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,940
And if that's not right if you could email us that would be great, but I'm pretty sure that it is right yeah

320
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
our email address is

321
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,620
Help at Jimmy John's

322
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Look at your personal struggles

323
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Did not do that podcast

324
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,420
The cost-benefit analysis of I had a seal dream last night

325
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm curious what it meant and the Internet is like, well, let's psychoanalyze and you're like, oh wait

326
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,860
Imagine if you woke up and you're like, how's your sleep? I jump with my seals clear my schedule. I'm going deep today

327
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,980
WikiHow told me I need to think about my problems and that's all it took to start me on this journey of self-discovery

328
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,620
Step one. I've been fighting a lot of whales lately. Oh

329
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
All done

330
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,500
Think about what's been on your mind lately. Have you been feeling overwhelmed by something at work or a personal relationship?

331
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,620
Have you been struggling to make a big decision? Yeah, maybe the seal can help with that

332
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,180
um

333
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,820
If I'm here to help

334
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Now tell me who's been eating your sandwich and using the copier at all hours. No, it's Sammy. Did you bring those fish?

335
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:30,620
I asked you for it. You did awesome. No, this is another this she's kind of gossipy at work, huh?

336
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh, that's a tough one tough one. Here's another interactive segment

337
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,780
I want both of you to evaluate your personal connection to seals

338
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,500
Have seals ever had a large importance in your life?

339
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,260
Do you have any particularly strong memories of seals? Is this like a scale of one to ten kind of deal?

340
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,340
I would say can I say I'm realizing this is I've tried to make seal jokes. I fucking

341
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Nothing. See. Oh

342
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:00,380
Nothing them. I if they're at like there's a seal show at the astounding

343
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:08,060
Nation's best if I may Atlanta aquarium, huh? And I actually might be the Georgia aquarium, but it is in Atlanta

344
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,420
There's a seal show there and it's like right there, right?

345
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,020
Yeah, and you just walk in and see seals doing tricks and I like don't care if I'm there or not

346
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,820
Sometimes I'll walk in there and see the seals. Yeah, sometimes I don't I don't care

347
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,260
I think that that might be a bigger connection of like your

348
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,000
Disinterest in dogs as well because to me seals are a very dog-like aquatic creature because for me

349
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,020
I'm at like an 8.5 on seals. I have feelings solely based around

350
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,740
Tina Majorino's star turn in Andre of course the seal movie where yeah if memory serves

351
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,900
She had a seal friend and that was about the extent of it

352
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:53,620
I think the seal solved a crime if I'm not mistaken. I think he she tried to pretend the seal was a real person

353
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
Mm-hmm

354
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,840
Like a seal and a dog become best friend or it's a dolphin and a dog isn't it? Yeah, that's not

355
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm gonna say yeah out of ten. I'm like an 8.5. I feel before you out on seal. I like them

356
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,180
I like them

357
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:17,320
Listener, please tweet us your feelings on seals. It's at Jimmy John's. I'd love to touch one. Just okay. Yeah

358
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
I bet they feel

359
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Super I would like to swim with on

360
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,040
Well, but I'm not a great swimmer

361
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:31,080
So I also feel like the dog the dog this he'll be very judgmental have to do the whole that old like put a collar around

362
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,600
two of them and

363
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Like what? Yeah that old chestnut. That's cool and not bad for them

364
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,600
Roxanne we should make it clear because some people are gonna be like

365
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,440
That's mean to say but the seals love it when they pull you through the water

366
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,800
They don't know what to do if they're not doing it. Yeah. Yeah, and it makes them like really strong

367
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,520
once you take it off and they're not hauling they're like

368
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,720
If you have two seals that have hauled me for a long time and you and hinge me

369
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,760
They're suddenly like half a Justin faster. Yeah, it's like and that's an amazing feeling they love that

370
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,200
It's not like a bad like SeaWorld thing

371
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,160
It's like a they they prefer it people probably think you're mean to yourself for exercising, right?

372
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,780
You know avoid dream dictionaries and they have a picture of a dream dictionary here, but it's it's backwards

373
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,920
Like the title is on the back cover of the book

374
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,160
So I don't is that because if you look it up you're gonna realize how much horse shit is

375
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,820
Time to put it all together question each image in your dream

376
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,800
Okay, for example, you remember an image from the dream

377
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,520
You are swimming in the ocean with your best friend when a large herd of seals approach the seals surround you and your friend is

378
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,800
Nowhere to be found

379
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,440
Damn, okay. What did they what did the seal is my friend a seal? No. Well, maybe I see you on

380
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,420
Maybe they turned into one, but I'm afraid to be a seal. Oh

381
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,040
Yeah, I'm letting opportunity pass me by opportunity for fun for change

382
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
transformation rebirth I just say

383
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,480
That they went with a herd of seals, but there's many terms that they could have gone with that are way better

384
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,280
Yeah, a rookery of seals

385
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:15,840
Oh a harem of seals which no or a bob of seals a

386
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,900
Bob that's pretty tight. I like that

387
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,480
I would love a hair of mostly. Oh god now if I introduce you to my

388
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,960
Yes, I this is the largest private estate in the nation over here. That's real for the door behind here

389
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,200
I have a harem of so well, I suppose you could say yes married

390
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,680
I don't describe to such a pedestrian labels. It's a harem

391
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,400
Figure out what please

392
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,920
Figure out what the seals mean in your specific dream. Yeah, no shit wiki out. What have we been doing, dude?

393
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,760
This is circular read this article on seal

394
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,400
In dream interpretation, it's like it just keeps going down the spiral

395
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,000
Here's a hyperlink to this article reflect on your feelings again. Thanks. You're wasting my time now

396
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,440
Last step apply the interpretation to your current situation. Is there a word count? They have to hit in this article

397
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
It feels like it. Absolutely

398
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,400
Yeah, man, figure it out and then look back over your notes and then do it do it you practice

399
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:31,440
This is all about practicing mindfulness though because it's you got you can't just look at the dream and be like the seal means that

400
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,120
I am in love with my best friend and I can't and I'm afraid to change you have to

401
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,520
You have to go and go to your best friend be like hey a seal a dream seal told me I'm in love with you

402
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,500
You have to be ready. We need to take some fish down to the aquarium if you have time and a big and a knife

403
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,880
One of them wanted a knife

404
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,920
My strategy I think is gonna be to figure out what the problem is and then try to fix the problem very hard for one

405
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,680
Week. Yeah, and then less hard for two. Uh-huh, and then stop completely after that

406
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,440
Yeah, I think my strategy is gonna be to stop watching movies about seals before I go to bed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's huge

407
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
I watch Andre every night. Yeah

408
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,120
Cuz it's it's so fucking funny and cute

409
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,960
You could watch a dolphin tail starring Harry Cronk Jr. And see if that changes anything. Sure

410
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
There's a lot of great movies you could watch

411
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,040
Fish you could watch fish tales is another one

412
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,840
Free Willy one through I don't know like six. Yeah, mr. The free Willy cartoon. There's a cyborg. Really?

413
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
limp it

414
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,640
Name one more fish movie Griffin my dinner with Andre is a sequel to Andre. Yeah

415
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Where Wallace Shawn?

416
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,640
Goes to dinner with a seal and the whole time he's like, why are you being so rude?

417
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,760
That was my celebrity impression for the episode

418
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,880
I don't have to do one at the end is that is my dinner with Andre the seal a comedy Griffin or is it played?

419
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,500
Straight, it's it's like a Linklater film. Oh, like they talk they talk about like

420
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,880
God and stuff. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah

421
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Not like a Dunstan checks in

422
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:14,160
Well it there is in some deleted scenes some parts where Dunstan talks about God and his Dunstan, okay

423
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,340
Dunstan doesn't appear in my dinner with Andre the seal though. No, no, no, no, that's a

424
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,460
Animal movie that is and that is the dumbest thing you've ever said

425
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah

426
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,360
Let's uh, let's take a brief break

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,180
For like four months and then woke up. Is that not what they do? That is not of Travis

447
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,160
Okay, listen. All right. Listen, stop the ad. I didn't realize that

448
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Not true. They're basically just kind of they sleep a lot

449
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,320
They don't do much but they're not just like in a sleep coma for four months. In fact

450
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,880
Uh, like during hibernation is when bears like give birth and shit

451
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,280
You're kidding. Oh, not just asleep. They're not just sleeping for like four months

452
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,680
Why did I think they would sleep for because I'm pretty sure that's what we were told them. We were kids

453
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,560
I feel like you were taught that a lot when you're a kid, but that's apparently not

454
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,640
They're just kind of like dozing a lot and not sure. Yeah, man

455
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,720
Okay, this doesn't sound right to me. Hi. Yeah, can I get another you need a second?

457
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,440

Have another all right

491
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,360
I'm a nanny for a couple of young child. My shift starts at 11 in the morning and ends shortly before dinner. I

492
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,600
Always eat an early lunch before this even though the parents remind me often

493
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,280
I'm welcome to any the food in the fridge or cabinets while I'm working. They're clearly worried

494
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,800
I don't feel comfortable enough in their home to eat

495
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,640
The real reason is that most of the food in their house is completely unappetizing to me

496
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,240
I simply bring my own stuff

497
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:25,400
Is there a polite way to signal them? They've made me feel perfectly welcome and just think their food looks kind of gross

498
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
That's from picky eater in Portland

499
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,420
Wow, so judgmental. Maybe you got I have a friend. He's a tiger. His name's Daniel. You know

500
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:42,060
I try new food because it might be good. Yeah, it was rhetorical, but he says you got to try new foods because they might taste good

501
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,140
We like whoa Jesus Christ. All right, we all guys that was jarring

502
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:54,780
I you should have heard that on my end was it wait till you hear that play play that back on your holy shit

503
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,100
I that tripped me out for a second little blood army there wows. Yeah

504
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:06,420
I was do your Daniel Tiger joke. Don't do mine. Okay, we like different things and that's just fine

505
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,420
But remember to be kind

506
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,420
Well, he also says if you have to go potty stop and go right away and that is really close-minded

507
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:19,660
Daniel Tiger if I I have tried to live a life and create a career for myself that does

508
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,100
Allow for that. Yeah. Yeah, that does allow me to go. I have to go potty even a little bit

509
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,540
So I'm going to stop what I'm doing right now, but sometimes you're on stage in front of a big screaming crowd

510
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,820
Yeah, and it doesn't work like that Daniel Tiger

511
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,940
Well to be fair the earlier version of that was we should live in a society where when one has to go potty

512
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,260
They should be able to stop and go right away with no judgment. We're like this is a little ideal

513
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,500
Yeah, they had to shorten that a little bit. Yeah, there's a song

514
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,860
It's like abolish work so we can go potty whenever we need to yeah, that's a good one

515
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,820
Give the businesses to the workers, right? You could get a

516
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,900
Cutting board and dip a knife in some hummus and then leave the knife on the game board

517
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,740
And then your desk job. Oh, I see what you're saying. This is to make it seem like you ate some of the food

518
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,860
Yeah, you didn't eat anything, but you like yeah, I'm real comfortable here. I didn't clean up after myself

519
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Now here's the thing we are all

520
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,860
children have our people and so really be a better really should and

521
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,780
We have from time to time had people watch our children, and I've done the line complete

522
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,020
You know you're you can eat here, but whenever I do that

523
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,700
I also think in the back of my head, but I did like pick out all this food because I wanted

524
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,860
But but you should know that I have a sort of mental catalog of exactly how much I have of all these things

525
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,260
And if there's less or none of the things that I think I have I will actually lose

526
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,100
I'm gonna tell you like whatever you want, but in my head

527
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,540
There are things that are like mine like that bag of M&Ms

528
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,020
That's mine and like if you eat that I'll be pissed not enough to not hire you again. Don't get it twisted

529
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,700
I like that you watch my kid, and I trust you

530
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,700
But if you eat that bag of M&Ms that I did not tell you not to eat

531
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,500
I'm gonna yeah like one degree like you us if if you drink my last Pepsi

532
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,680
You enjoy looking at the inside of my home because it will be the last time oh boy. Oh boy. Oh you ate the doughnuts, okay?

533
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,620
Yeah, although I will say when I was a babysitter when I used to babysit

534
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,840
Oh, oh boy. There's nothing more delicious than like oh shit. You guys have

535
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
We never have put it in our house

536
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,820
When I was babysitting I had a lot of secret bathroom gushers because I knew they weren't for me

537
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,140
And I could not let the children see me eat them

538
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,940
So I would sort of take them and go into the bathroom and eat like five at a time

539
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,700
Yeah

540
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,500
Finish a pack and like man you would not believe how fast I could polish off a pack of gushers

541
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,940
And I'm pretty sure that's not the first time I've said that sentence on this show

542
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Is

543
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
There a way to say to them oh

544
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:59,460
I do feel comfortable here. It's just that your food is yucky without it being a thing like oh, no

545
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,460
Thank you. Why are you rephrasing the question because I'm trying to think if there's a way if you could say

546
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:12,900
Hmm. Oh, you know what actually on Tuesdays. I only eat turkey sandwiches cuz it starts with a T

547
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,820
Just like Tuesdays. Sorry. It's bug day. Huh?

548
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,620
That's not what I said, but I like yours only bugs for me

549
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,340
but then the problem with Hakuna Matata I

550
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,580
Am I am living my life as a repub book and I have

551
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,060
You've probably heard about this on Instagram you've probably heard about this

552
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,440
But I'm a repub and I feel like I'm living my life as a poom

553
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,900
But it's a choice that I made for myself to make a more sustainable choice for yeah

554
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,460
Henry Cavill did it to get ready for man

555
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,840
He actually got really cup, but that's not that's not that's point of it

556
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Even though he did look so good in the Nola home

557
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,420
You may not have noticed this they had to CG a lot of his face stuff in the Superman movie

558
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,380
Yeah, because he but he was living a very poomba lifestyle at the time

559
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,660
So they had to like get the tusks out of the picture

560
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,500
Yeah, and he had a lot of carapace all over his chin great just eaten

561
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,740
I'm but so I'm doing that but no, please don't buy bugs for me. And I know you're

562
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,900
I'll just find them underneath like your floorboards and stuff. I'm helping you out really I

563
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:25,420
Like I only like them when they're so paintable. Is that the word? Sorry. I've only been repubed for a few weeks now

564
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,860
So I'm just kind of getting into it. So please don't hit me with non bugs

565
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Because it is a bug day for me

566
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,660
Tomorrow, I'm gonna find a baby and race. It's my own. It's a whole lifestyle. It's not just the food thing

567
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,660
I am looking for a meerkat partner

568
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,220
So if you know any meers and you actually are you I know you have a lot of questions

569
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,260
You cannot ask them. You can't

570
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,380
Is what I'll say every time if you ask do you think do you think?

571
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:59,900
That way after many years when Simba was was traveling around with Timon and poomba. Do you think?

572
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,060
That it there was ever a moment where he like wandered away to the two of them and here they ran into like a goose

573
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,100
Or something and it goes like who's that over there? And Simba's like, oh, those are my dad's

574
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Goals Justin those

575
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:22,340
Are not Simba's dad's Justin they're his uncle my dumb not bug eating real death fell and died

576
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,860
Do you think he ever slipped up he's like

577
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:35,060
Like poop alike handed him a bug and he's like, thanks. Oh, yeah, and there's like silence like what did you say? Oh,

578
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,760
Okay, this is okay. I'm gonna need to walk away for a second. I do think it's nice that

579
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,340
That that married couple Timon and poomba adopted a lion child. I think that that is nice

580
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,300
But do you think there was ever a moment where you know when he's the full-grown adult and he's back there at the pride

581
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,940
Lance he would hunt and kill because he is a lion. That's what he do and he would come home

582
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,980
Just like his face dripping in blood and gore. Yeah, and Timon and poomba was like, oh, right

583
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,260
Oh, all right

584
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:09,900
He's a terrifying lion that we have really kind of like hitched our wagon to they don't like to hunt and kill

585
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:17,580
They don't show day after he deposes the bad uncle and he's like, what's up? Everybody? I'm King now. Guess what bugs?

586
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,620
only it's all the bugs we can't be buds with

587
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:30,100
Zebra and also eat zebra. We we are now bugs bugs have no souls. No faces. They are the perfect food

588
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,860
You're gonna zebras like so what do we do? We love this stuff. No

589
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,940
Oh, okay leaves sleeves are alive to only bugs bugs are already dead. I

590
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:48,700
And the bugs are like, oh, excuse me. I mean not so fast. Um, then then and then and then okay

591
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,060
I want a month

Travis McElroy. I know

597
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,500
Don't I'd like to announce that I will not be covering a story with the headline Pizza Hut to enter the metaverse

598
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,340
And why not? I will not be covering why not?

599
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,900
Because I'm not I'm not fucking doing it. Okay. Here's one. Here's one sentence

600
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,340
The undead drivers will remind attendees to grab pizza now and enter one of nine NFTs

601
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,340
All of which will come with a free year of pizza. It seems like an AI wrote that sentence

602
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,440
Yeah, I'm not doing it. I net wrote that we're going to our fucking sweet spot right now as Hardee's

607
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:07,560
Pizza in would be Taco Bell taco chime. I think if I was pizza in you're a copier and everyone's mad at you

608
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,120
Chipotle Olive Garden do one guys

609

625
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,940

00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,140
It's not a wrap. It's not a wrap

628
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,260
No, what?

629
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,060
They also have tangy

630
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,060
amber bbq sauce

631
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:57,580
Homage to the iconic Jurassic World amber resin. Oh, okay. Yeah, but is the is it amber colored?

632
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,580
Amber is the flavor of my bbq

633
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,300
I think world is such an iconic

634
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:11,340
Franchise just like our menus that we wanted to make sure we were doing the film's justice and put a lot of inspiration from them

635
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,900
We're making it. It doesn't feel like you are

636
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,180
It doesn't seem like it Owen Klein the VP of culinary

637
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:25,940
Innovation the culinary team has had a lot of fun with this and when consumers bite into these big meaty items

638
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,060
We want them to be instantly

639
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,980
Transported to the world of Jurassic. No, that's the sentence

640
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,820
That's all it says we want them to be instantly transported to the world of Jurassic the world of Jurassic

641
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,180
Oh, hey Owen. Have you seen any of the movies?

642
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,420
Cuz that they don't call it that they're not like welcome to the park of Jurassic or well

643
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,720
The one that's not Owen. I don't think that people are reading these or writing them

644
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,580
Oh Griffin joked about AI but like listen to this to build excitement leading up to the film's release

645
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:05,060
CKE is bringing the movie to life by turning to Carl's juniors and Hardy locations into the biggest

646
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,460
dinosaur bite magnet the world has ever seen

647
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,500
By I like every dinosaur saw it. They could not help but bite it. Is that what we are too?

648
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,420
I think that Richard Schiff is kind of a dinosaur bite magnet

649
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,460
well, yeah, the Jurassic World dino takeovers in Los Angeles and

650
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,500
Nashville will feel those two almost

651
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:33,380
if they will feel as if they could almost be part of the movie itself there may even be a

652
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,420
Jurassic t-rex at the Los Angeles

653
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,960
Which do not he says to me someone's like

654
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
I don't know if I can get

655
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,420
T-rex there my uncle

656
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,100
I'm talking to him to see if we can get it there but no guarantees

657
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,400
Okay

658
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,880
But he said if I was a good boy should fans should go at their own risk because this summer

659
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,120
Carl's Jr. And Hardy's restaurants are the most thrilling places to go then I'm not gonna go

660
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,600
Yeah, we're giving guests the opportunity to experience the world of Jurassic with unforgettable bites saying that as well stop saying

662
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800

670
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,000
Getting whimsical with things that direct like two-ton moving vehicles around the world would love that if

671
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,880
Just like oh you need to get the hospital

672
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,680

What's all about Sarah tops on whatsapp? That's it's my octave. That sentence was so cool

686
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,040
It's so cool. I don't know what any of it is

687
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,140
It's starting to feel a little bit like when someone's writing a long report to hand into a teacher and they're pretty sure

688
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:28,000
The teachers not gonna read every word of every report and so they just start kind of saying things in the middle

689

Can I get a quick thumbs up or thumbs down from you guys or one out of ten on?

708
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,320
First off why does the burrito have a face?

709
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,560
Secondly how delicious do these offer not delicious at all I?

710
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,020
And I love trash. I like I like I like trash food. It's hard for me to separate

711
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,960
The day it is going to give me

712
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Yeah, there's also I noticed no, and they really leaned into this vegetables present on here

713
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:24,400
It is yeah, there's no tomato or lettuce or even they notably don't list the the

714
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,880
Ingredients in the mouth-watering primal angus thickburger. Yeah

715
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,200
But it's not vegetables definitely not there there is an onion slice in there

716
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,560
No, I think that's onion rings Justin. That's a slice of onion deep-fried sure

717
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,920
But I would not say that hundred percent a black angus beef patty char-broiled

718
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:53,960
Over an open I guess and topped with tender slow-cooked sliced prime rib tangy amber BBQ sauce

719
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,400
Smoked cheddar and onion rings served on a toasted potato bun

720
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,480
And they did go ahead and put that sauce on the top and bottom to really ruin your shirt

721
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Thank you

722
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,440

00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,240
