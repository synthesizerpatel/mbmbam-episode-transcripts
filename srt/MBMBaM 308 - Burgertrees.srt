1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother My Brother and Me,

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,240
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Justin McElroy. And who are some good dads that you know? Let's hear it for the daddies.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,080
Let's give the daddies hands. This is our special show. Give them hands?

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
Give the daddies hands for their special day. This is a daddy episode all about daddies. We're

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,400
taking your daddy questions live on the air. Are you a daddy? Do you know a daddy? Is there a

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,440
special daddy in your life? I'm on a website right now called Daddy Chat, and I'm just sort

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,000
of like looking. A lot of messages coming in through Daddy Chat right now, and a lot of them,

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
I would say, are of a surprisingly explicit nature. Well, just let them know that you're

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,200
looking for a special daddy who will take care of you and see what they say. Our dad is, of course,

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,960
here. We have not provided him with a microphone, but I can tell you he's on my end and just

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,240
laughing along and just really savoring every second of it. Hi, daddy. Quick question. I feel

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,960
like there's a cipher I'm missing, some sort of codex. You know in National Treasure Book of

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,720
Secrets, they find the magic magnifying glass, and that lets them read. That's our dad's favorite

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,640
movie. Yeah, it lets them read the other Declaration of Independence on the back of the

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,040
other one, and it says, this one's just kidding about the gun stuff. Because it mentions a lot

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,040
of that in the Declaration of Independence. A lot of this is getting away from me, but you know

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,120
what I'm talking about? A cipher, like a codex. I feel like I'm missing one of those to really

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,840
enjoy the daddy chat experience, because they keep mentioning something called cummies?

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Cummies? Or coomies? Do they mean gummies? Is it an autocorrect thing? If it's an autocorrect thing,

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,800
then it's autocorrecting everyone. Weird. That's weird. Weird. That's so weird. Maybe they're a big

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,080
fan of- Oh, is this like- Was there a gummy bear named Daddy Bear? Maybe that's it. Maybe this is

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,360
like a- It's about the gummy bears. Maybe they're trying to say curries, and it's like autocorrecting

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,360
like way off. Maybe that's it. We're talking about some of our best dads. Who's your favorite dad?

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
I gotta get the fuck off daddy chat. Yeah, I think it's broken bad. I think it might be a sex thing

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:13,360
about pork and dads. I'm not into that. Here's some- Trav, I'm gonna name a word, and you tell

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,400
me the best one of those words. The five best of that word that you can think of. It's the easiest

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,040
game I've ever played. Top blank that. Oh, I gotcha. Okay. The first word that I want you to

34
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,760
rank the top five of is dads. Okay. The daddiest dads? Is that what I'm doing here? Top five dads.

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,160
Top five dads. We'll go five to first order. Okay. Fifth, that would be Henry Jones Sr.

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
Correct. Griffin, number four. Oh, I was gonna do all of them. That's all right. Number four,

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Joseph Gordon Lovett. Congratulations JGL on your baby and your promising movie career

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:05,440
on both sides of the camera lens. Number three is Austin Powers Sr. Correct. That's good too.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,520
Okay. Griffin, number two dad of all time. Number two dad is of course French Stewart,

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,800
also from Third Rock from The Sun. Congratulations French Stewart. You're doing a great job and we're

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,920
all thinking about you today. On this special day. Travis McElroy, who is the number one dad

42
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,440
of all time? Oh, number one dad. Number one dad. I'm gonna say James Bond Sr. Well, I'm gonna say

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,440
our dad. Have fun at Christmas, dipshit. Our dad is James Bond Sr. and you can't prove otherwise.

44
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360
You're not gonna get any presents this year, Travis. You know that's what dad bases the

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,000
present distribution off of. Santa delivers presents, stupid. Santa is an amazing daddy.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Santa is. He is. Like he raised Frank Claus. Look how he turned out. This is our vice show.

47
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,920
I don't know why I started saying it like that, like a poorly conceived SNL character,

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,640
but this is our vice show where we take your questions and turn them out like in wisdom.

49
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,760
We had a great, I want to say because we haven't recorded a new episode since. As you might be

50
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,520
able to tell from a little bit of the rust. A little bit of the rust, the grime. A lot of

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,960
Paul Rust on this machine. We're gonna get back in the swing of things, but I did want to say a

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,200
huge thank you to everybody who came out to our New York and DC shows. They were just a hoot and

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,160
a half really. We had a blast and thanks to the people who, like thanks to Hodgman for coming out

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,440
and performing in our New York show and Still Buffering and Sawbones and everybody. So the

55
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Schmanners, everybody who helped make their shows so much fun. Of course you who came out,

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,040
we really appreciate you. And as long as we're touching on stuff that we didn't get to talk

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,280
about, I snuck up to Max Funcon West, which was, as always, super fun. And the macros are going

58
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,520
to be at Max Funcon East and there's still a couple tickets available for that. We would

59
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,680
like to see you there in September in what may be a haunted, shining-esque hotel in the Poconos

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,560
in September. We would like to see you there. If you haven't been to Max Funcon before,

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,520
it's amazing. It's really, really amazing. It's gonna be a hoot. And like literally all of our,

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:22,160
like a brood, a large chunk of our families will be there. Go to maxfuncon.com right now

63
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and you can come see that. I have a question for you all and it comes from one of our listeners.

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,480
The question goes a little something like this.

65
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:39,680
It goes like this. It goes like this. I'm a Waluigi. This question is written in a special

66
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:53,360
pervert font. This is all dildos. It's Comic Sins. Okay, first question. Brothers, I just sat down

67
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,920
to do some work at Starbucks. The guy at the next table is clearly sketching me in this

68
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,120
notebook. Jesus. I really need to get some work done, but it's very distracting. What do I do?

69
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,200
I tried giving him a direct stare down, but no luck. He was probably gized about that. Like,

70
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,640
oh, thank goodness. This is much better. And if I do stay here, do I look at the finished product

71
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,840
over his shoulder as I leave? And that's from Begrudging Model in Boston. Holy shit. First off,

72
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,040
I wish you'd save this for our live show in Boston next month. This would be fantastic.

73
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah, Dan, this would have been a club banger. Here's the thing. The one situation in which

74
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,440
this would be acceptable is if you are in Paris and it's like, oh, how wonderful. It's like that

75
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,240
scene in Before Sunset where the guy's like, hello, I made the poem for you, milkshake.

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
And it's like, dude, fucking cool it, please. I'm just like walking around all night. I'm super tired.

77
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,200
Can you not poem me right now, bro? There was a dude who walked up to me on the streets of

78
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Cincinnati and said, for a dollar, I'll do a rap on you. And I gave him that dollar.

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,840
It was not a good rap. It was okay. But I don't feel like you really touched on the

80
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,040
cornerstones of what makes me me. Yeah, sure. You get what you pay for. Yeah, it was a dollar, bud.

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,200
I mean, that's true. You should ask if he had a $5 plan available with better raps.

82
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,240
Is there like a VIP rap that I can pay for where you follow me around for a year and really

83
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,120
construct an in-depth narrative of my life? How much does it cost for the good rhymes?

84
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,920
Give me your dank rhymes. Good, sir. A few ways to combat this, I'm just thinking of off the top

85
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,120
of my head, shine a very bright light in their eyes so they can't draw. If you don't want to

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
be aggressive about it, you could just move your body around a whole lot so you don't really get

87
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
a bead on your ankles. Just keep turning your head, move your fingers around, because that's

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,240
the trickiest part, as everyone knows, is fingers. While you were doing some work at Starbucks,

89
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,400
is it possible that you were nude and covering your frame with various fig leaves? Because if

90
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,280
that's the case, then I think- Are you a bowl of fruit? Are you a bowl of fruit is a good question,

91
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,920
Travis. What the question asker didn't mention is that the work that they were doing in Starbucks

92
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,040
was modeling. They were smizing and they were stretching out like languorously, like practicing

93
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,320
their form. That's a good fucking point, Justin, is if they were a model, that shit isn't free.

94
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,080
You can't just walk up to Ty Ty and just snap pics, because you actually, guess what? You need

95
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,640
to pay tens of thousands of dollars in order to do that. Do you know what I mean? You can't just

96
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,240
snap or draw a model. They work fucking hard. Here's what you do. While you're working on your

97
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,320
screenplay, and this dude's drawing you, you start writing a scene in which a guy is drawing you,

98
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,080
and the scene is about what a jerk he is, and then you just slowly turn the screen to him and

99
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,560
point at it so he can read it. And if he gets offended by, oh, you were drawing me and I was

100
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,400
writing you, how's it feel? How's it feel, Picasso? And then you walk out.

101
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,000
I think their job is that they're a comics writer, and you work the whole time on a word bubble to

102
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
put over their picture, and then you go over and try to very confidently with the word bubble you

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
cut out and just put a word bubble coming out of your mouth like, what, me worry?

104
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,040
Coming this July from the McElroy brothers. Rent two. It's really shitty this time. It's like

105
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,480
super duper shitty. Can't we have a partnership on our hands? You know what I was just thinking

106
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
about is that this scenario that is being described from this perspective is obviously

107
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,920
like so baffling and insane, right? It's bad. But I bet, but if you look at the inverse of it,

108
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,280
you could definitely see the artist here, you could see like their instructor being like,

109
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,640
it doesn't matter what you're drawing. You just need to get out there and draw. If you're at the

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
cafe, if you're at Starbucks, just whip out your notepad and draw the people around you.

111
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,320
It's about drawing life. They don't really think about the repercussions of that actually doing

112
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,840
that. I agree with you, Justin. I agree with you right up until the point that they give them a

113
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,800
full stare down, and it's just like, hmm, I see you. And at that point, the artist continues to

114
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,000
do it, but the artist already started on it. What do you want him to do? Put like a droopy

115
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,280
dog face on it? No, it wasn't you. Well, it's her hair, but his face because she stared at me halfway

116
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,200
through. Yeah. Do you guys want to Yahoo? I would love that. This one was sent in by level 9000

117
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,040
Yajujuru Drew Davenport. Sorry, there is a banner ad for an iced caramel macchiato at the top of this

118
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
Yahoo page. I'm actually going to refresh it. Everybody knows it's from Drew Davenport,

119
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,600
right? Okay, I can refresh it. Try and get rid of that ad because it was making my mouth just like,

120
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,800
it was just, I think I was having cummies. I don't know what that means yet, but I-

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
You probably shouldn't announce that you're having it until you figure out what it is.

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Okay, it's fair. Yahoo answers user Ivan asked this one who says,

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,400
how was Snoop Dogg able to smoke for so long without getting arrested?

124
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,560
This is an excellent question if you really ponder it, because during E3, the video games,

125
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,320
America's premier video games showcase, which Justin and I covered last week, there was a

126
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,520
Battlefield 1 event where all the big names and big celebrities came out to play Battlefield 1

127
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,680
against each other and Zac Efron and Jamie Foxx were there and Snoop Dogg was there and they were

128
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
talking about how they were going to smoke so much weed while they play Battlefield and then there

129
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,800
was a camera on Snoop Dogg while he smoked weed playing Battlefield. And that's like, that's not

130
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,000
legal, right? And yet, and yet I feel like there's lots of situations where Snoop Dogg's just like,

131
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm gonna have this weed now and everyone's like, that's okay, that's okay for you, for you to do.

132
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,760
No, okay, but wait, it was in California, right? That's fair, that's fair. Okay, but extrapolate

133
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
then fucking Willie Nelson rolls up to Austin and he's like, as long as he's touching the statue of

134
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
himself on 2nd Street in Austin, Texas, he can light up the biggest spliff ever and people are

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,680
just like, that's, it's him. No, no, no, you're missing it. No, no, no, you don't, you are the

136
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,120
one missing it because he's the weed man. He's the weed man so he's allowed to, fucking Fiona

137
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
Apple comes and she's gonna play a show for me and my wife in Austin, but on the way she gets

138
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,600
pulled over in town in Texas, has a little bit of weed on her, gets arrested, cancels the show.

139
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Well, that's Fiona Apple. If she had a big old box of apples, that would be okay.

140
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,040
But the thing is, the thing is, is you're missing out that both Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson are so

141
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,320
good at weed at this point. They smoke it so good and so fast that the human eye can no longer

142
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,400
comprehend that they are smoking weed. So like the authorities have been trying to catch Snoop Dogg

143
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:50,400
forever and they're like, he said, he get, like, this is like, like old style gangster, like 1920s

144
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,240
level, like he told them when he was gonna do it, where he was gonna do it, how he was gonna do it.

145
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,600
And this is like, now you see me three, you had, everybody was looking at Snoop Dogg. They know

146
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,120
he smoked the weed, but when Griffin, but when. On the camera, there's foot, you don't see, you're

147
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,720
Moving pictures. There's a moving digital audio video. But if you go frame by frame, you never

148
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,560
actually see the weed touch his mouth. And yet he did it, Griffin. How? Through his fingers? Through

149
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,720
his what? Did he put it in his ear? I don't even know. The thing about it is, if you do anything

150
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,880
hard enough, eventually they're just gonna let you. Yeah. Like my best example of this is Don

151
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,160
Rickles. Don Rickles has been doing racist jokes for so long. For quite a long time. That he is the

152
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,000
only person literally in the country that could just like drop it, like any, like whatever. Yeah.

153
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,560
Like stuff that I can't even pretend to do as a joke here in like a pastiche of Mr. Rickles

154
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,480
distinctive comedy. Like, because I would be literally crucified on a cross to death. Yes.

155
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
Everybody looks at Don, he's like, that's how Don do. He just did it so hard. Nobody can stop him.

156
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,640
What happened with Mr. Chong? He did get arrested for weed, right? But so like, when did he fall out?

157
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,720
Like, is there only room for three people at the top? At the top of the ladder? Or it's just like,

158
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,960
it's like the purge 24 seven for them. And Griffin, I'll pay you this picture. And Chong got

159
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,880
bumped down off of it. I think you mean the purge for 20. This is how it went. There was a rookie

160
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,840
cop first day on the job, first day on the beat. And like, well, they're having their morning cop

161
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,520
meeting their morning staff meeting first day. Cop goes, Hey, shouldn't we arrest Tommy Chong?

162
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,640
And everyone went, well, we can't, we can't do that. And he said, why not? And the everybody

163
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:59,280
else went, uh, well, huh? What? Hey, everybody, why haven't we arrested Tommy Chong? He got arrested.

164
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,000
He was selling a lot of paraphernalia, a lot. And he went to jail for nine months. That's fucking

165
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,600
ridiculous. But according to Google, he lost, he forfeited about $120,000 in assets paid a fine of

166
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,840
$20,000. This is combined loss of 140 K, but he also had to give up his internet domain name of

167
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:26,640
tommychong.com. Let's just say, why? Yeah. I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was a thing that

168
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,520
the America could take away from you. Like, so sorry, but it's gone now. You can't have

169
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,440
travismacaroy.com anymore. You can't have it. You sold too many bongs, Mr. Chong. And so,

170
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
Oh, that rhymes. That's fun. Have you ever thought about that? Mr. Chong? Anyway, nine months,

171
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,960
give me your URL. Yoink. Back to back to go, daddy. You go whoosh, like throwing a fish back

172
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,920
in the ocean. Wait, hold on. Is tommychong.com available for purchase? Well, now it redirects

173
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:02,240
to his Facebook page. Oh, well, hold on. I'm going to buy it. Anyway, Snoop Dogg is, I'm not gonna

174
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,720
play on his page is a link to his new product line, which is of course, you guessed it,

175
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,760
Chong's Choice vaporizers. If you're gonna vape, vape with Chong. I believe I will. Thank you.

176
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,400
Listen, I'm not, no, no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade. Legalize it. Go fucking. Yes, please,

177
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,000
please, please. I'm just saying, like, I was at the event. I was at that battlefield event. I

178
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
smelled the dupe. I smelled the duper. I smelled the duper. I was like, huh, that's weird. And

179
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,920
later I found out the source of the duper. I was like, that makes very much sense. And,

180
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,920
but you can think that you could just do it. If you're, if you're one of these three people,

181
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,680
I hope that they're able to put a stop to this menace. Let's let's do a new question.

182
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,600
By the way, someone sent a scoreboard from that celebrity match and who was at the top.

183
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,760
You guessed it. Mr. Snoop Dogg. Maybe you can only arrest him if his KD starts jumping.

184
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
Because like you can't legal. There's a, well, conviction wouldn't hold up. Cause look how

185
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,120
fucking bad he's nose scoping everybody constantly. How, how does that guy front do?

186
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Cause that dude was fucking blazed out of his gourd. He's still playing. He did pretty good

187
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,880
too. From what I heard that dude was Zamboni. Um, we are, uh, we're going to ask another question

188
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,560
right now. I live in a small apartment in Brooklyn, New York with two roommates, one of whom uses an

189
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,960
excessive amount of toilet paper. Okay. Just getting a text message here from my father. Can't

190
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,120
can't mute it. Cause it's father's day. And if he needs me, I thought it was in the room.

191
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,240
Fiction. You're a dad too. So it cancels out. That's true. Good point. I live in a small apartment

192
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
in Brooklyn, New York with two roommates, one of whom uses an excessive amount of toilet paper.

193
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm not exaggerating when I say that she alone goes through at least two rolls alone in one day.

194
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,160
No, you are exaggerating when you say that. Cause that's if that's true, then this person would be

195
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,800
dead just from like all the fluid in their body being absorbed out of them by toilet paper. She

196
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,240
might be cone heads eating it. Uh, I, it's not just that I'm curious about what she does with

197
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,600
the toilet paper. I'm sick of writing 10 stops on the subway every week with 24 rolls of TP

198
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,680
because she never buys her own. It's gotten to the point where I'm hiding my own secret TP

199
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
so as not to be caught with my pants down. So to speak, how can I get her to use a reasonable amount

200
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,080
of TP as from feeling shitty in the big city? I'm a little bit disappointed that you have already

201
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,520
gotten to buy your own secret toilet paper. Cause that was going to be my opening salvo.

202
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Absolutely. It was going to be my opening salvo. Now, now I'm at like, um, get a little toilet

203
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,040
paper size toolbox for yourself. You can probably fit three or four rolls in there and then put

204
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,760
like a combination lock on it and then write like Gerald's dookie box on the top.

205
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,760
See, that's too perfect. A TP fiend like this is going to find that instantly

206
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,400
and they're going to bring their own lock picks or they're going to crack it. I say,

207
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,480
you have to hide it in plain sight. Can you make, uh, curtains out of toilet paper in the bathroom?

208
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,880
So like when you need a fix, it's like right there. And she's like, where does she get these

209
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,000
wonderful toys? By which I mean toilet paper. Um, and you'll, you'll know your secret stash.

210
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
It's right there in plain view. Two rolls in one day?

211
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah. I mean, I'm still very much with you there, Travis, at the first,

212
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,720
like it's hard for me to mount that first sentence. This is like American Ninja Warrior,

213
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,920
only it starts off with the 12 and a half foot wall. And I just didn't have a really hard time

214
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,400
scaling it so I can take on the other challenges on the course.

215
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,280
That person alone is going through an entire package of toilet paper in like two weeks.

216
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,080
What the fuck? I'm worried.

217
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,480
This is, um, one of the problems with our nation's hangups about not discussing this kind of thing

218
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,720
in public because maybe this person's just using a giganto wad because they think about this for a

219
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
second. Okay.

220
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,680
Unless somebody told you, like at what point in your life, if you're using like a giganto wad of

221
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:01,040
toilet paper every time you beamed and, or number one, um, if you're using like a giganto wad,

222
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,600
who would ever tell you, you don't need that much. You know what I mean?

223
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,920
That's not like a life coach for this kind of thing.

224
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,680
There's probably someone out there using one square who's going to listen to this like,

225
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,960
oh fuck, I could use more squares.

226
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

227
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,160
Fucking first time I saw this Sharman commercial, it was like, it's so good.

228
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
You only need two squares.

229
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
I was like, is that?

230
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
Hey, I looked at everybody in the room.

231
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,440
I was like, hey everyone, is that the normal amount of squares?

232
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,120
Cause I do, I'll be, I don't use a giganto wad, but I was using at that point maybe six or seven

233
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want there to be any breach.

234
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,360
I like use enough that I can trick myself into not feeling like I'm using my hand to wipe myself.

235
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,880
Right.

236
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
Which like, by the way, let's sidestep this whole question and say,

237
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,960
get like a dope ass bidet installed and do things in the Japanese style, which would fix everything.

238
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,560
Um, uh, I mean, you'd still need to, you would need like at least

239
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,560
one to two squares just for a courtesy wipe, but is this, I don't, I hope this isn't too blue

240
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,000
because I said I was going to put the tiger on the table and we need to confront some stuff

241
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,840
as a nation because this person alone is going to like take down.

242
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
Hey, do you remember sequoias?

243
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,000
They used to exist because, but then Melissa just went ham with her beamers and her onesies.

244
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,800
This is called the Melissa park.

245
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
It's where the sequoias used to be.

246
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
And now it's just Melissa's deforested.

247
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,600
This is good.

248
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
You, you confront Melissa and you say you can keep using as much toilet paper,

249
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
but every month you have to plant a new tree.

250
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
You like you, Melissa, this is like when you cut down a tree, you got to plant too.

251
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,240
Like Melissa needs to start doing that.

252
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,800
You need to find an area for Melissa to plant trees.

253
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,640
And then someone sees Melissa planting like six trees and she's like,

254
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know, Chipotle, right?

255
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,320
It's a rough week.

256
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,280
I went on a cruise.

257
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
I don't know what to tell you.

258
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
I don't know what to tell you.

259
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay.

260
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,600
Oh man.

261
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Um, how do you start this dialogue?

262
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,880
I think you can start it with like, I'm not mad.

263
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm extremely worried about you.

264
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,040
Yeah.

265
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,760
Um, I mean, I'd be mad also.

266
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
I can be both.

267
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm, I'm mad and worried about both of you pretty much constantly.

268
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,320
I'll tell you the truth.

269
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,800
At this point, Melissa, Melissa is not, there's a good chance Melissa is not

270
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,360
aware of where the toilet paper is coming from.

271
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,040
Like she doesn't second guess it.

272
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,160
She just uses it up.

273
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,960
And then there's more cause you keep going and getting it.

274
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,800
And if you went to Melissa and if you went to Melissa and we're like,

275
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,960
Hey, straight up, you're using way too much, way too fast.

276
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,040
And like, I have to go.

277
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,960
Somebody has to go get it.

278
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,320
Something's gotta give Melissa.

279
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah.

280
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,560
You gotta stop eating this like coneheads pasta.

281
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
You have to be better, Melissa.

282
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
You have to be better.

283
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,720
Hey, how's your, how's your plumbing situation, gang?

284
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
How's the, how's the pipes like at this house?

285
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
Cause I bet they're not great.

286
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
I bet it's not a not great scene.

287
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,560
Yeah.

288
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,120
I have to buy toilet paper every day, every waking day of my life.

289
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
And also we spend $700 on plumbing every day.

290
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,880
And my whole neighborhood is flooded constantly.

291
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,680
The utilities are not great here in Atlantis.

292
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,160
I think that you should, I think that you should brick over the bathroom door.

293
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,600
I think you should cask of a Montelotto your own bathroom.

294
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,280
And then when this person says, I'd like to use the bathroom, please.

295
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,520
You say, we've never had a bathroom.

296
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,040
That would be very expensive.

297
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,840
Not everybody in New York can afford a bathroom.

298
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
And you start going to bathroom and whatever establishment will have you.

299
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,160
It's New York.

300
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,640
There's a lot of different places with bathrooms.

301
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
And you're gonna have to make that sacrifice

302
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
if you really want to stop buying TP.

303
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
It's your only option.

304
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,480
Yeah, or you just fucking play the most high stakes game of chicken ever.

305
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
And you don't buy TP anymore.

306
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
You tell your other mate, no more buying TP.

307
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
It's gonna be a lean week.

308
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,600
You say to them, giving your good, giving your good roommate fair warning,

309
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
but not telling your bad roommate anything.

310
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
And your bad roommate, you'll be like,

311
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
where's toilet claws?

312
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,240
And you say, what the fuck did you just say?

313
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
You know, toilet claws.

314
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,680
He brings new TP every day.

315
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,160
So I can use a big ginormo wad to feel comfortable.

316
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,040
And you say that.

317
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,160
Sometimes I just throw some away just so he'll come back.

318
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Hey, hold on a second.

319
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
Something just occurred to me.

320
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,720
You live with two roommates and one of them uses an excessive amount of toilet.

321
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,840
One of them is toilet claws.

322
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:49,200
What kind of QPRO work did you have to conduct to decipher exactly which one of the roommates

323
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,160
was using an incongruous amount of toilet paper?

324
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,480
What sort of like, I mean, CSI stuff had to happen?

325
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,240
The only thing that makes sense is you go in to the junk room

326
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,800
and you unspool one of those bad boys and you count each square.

327
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
And then you wait for the trap to be sprung.

328
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,040
And then when you come back and there's no toilet paper anywhere in the house anymore,

329
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,920
after one bathroom visit from somebody, that was the one who did it.

330
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,360
I put a human hair across this toilet paper.

331
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,040
Also the toilet has flooded the entire city.

332
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,400
Then it was that one who did that did the thing that was so bad.

333
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Could you start using more toilet paper?

334
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,640
Could you somehow fix this problem by amping up your toilet paper to like even like twice

335
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,160
what this person is doing?

336
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,080
I'm talking about if you're mowing through four rolls a day until they're forced to start

337
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,520
buying their own rolls of toilet paper, maybe they'll like start the conversation with you.

338
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,080
If you're looking for like an easy way to get into it.

339
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
Say, okay, I'll make you a deal.

340
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,520
How about we all come back to one roll per day and that that way at least you're cutting

341
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,560
them in half, right?

342
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,760
Like that's progress.

343
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,240
I would also argue that one roll a day is still excessive.

344
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
Quite a bit, quite a bit.

345
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,480
Is this what that song Big Yellow Taxi is about?

346
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,840
This Yahoo was sent in by Christopher Lamp.

347
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,640
Thank you, Christopher.

348
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user consumer who asks,

349
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,320
why can't we grow burger in tree?

350
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,800
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

351
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,360
What?

352
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

353
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,960
One more again.

354
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

355
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,280
It's a, it's you read it and you think, well, this is just goofy.

356
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,320
But then you think about like, we got fucking Soylent now.

357
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,880
We got fucking, you know, to real life to Mac.

358
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Oh, like the things are happening in the science space.

359
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Why can't we go burger?

360
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,720
Why can't we go burger in tree?

361
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,720
So in Big Top Pee Wee, there was definitely a bush that grew hot dog like cocktail Franks.

362
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,040
Yes.

363
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Is that anything?

364
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,080
Is that something?

365
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,120
Does that get us closer to why can't we grow burger in tree?

366
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,520
Oh, the question is, are we trying to grow fully constructed burgers?

367
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Is it okay if it's in pieces and you put it together yourself?

368
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,600
Can there be a bun tree, a burger tree?

370
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,040
In this fucking fantasy world that we've created for ourselves where burger grow in tree,

371
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,720
we still got to do a little bit of work.

372
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,800
We still, we can't get, you know, we still got to cook the meat, for example.

373
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm just saying that science could probably tackle this easier if we're willing to do it in pieces

374
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,520
rather than trying to grow fully formed, constructed, grilled.

375
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,680
But are the burgers growing grilled?

376
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,880
Okay, this is actually an excellent point, Travis, because let's say we did grow burger in tree.

377
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay, okay.

378
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,320
All right.

379
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,680
Try to think of an optimal point at which you would like a hamburger blossom to emerge, right?

380
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah.

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,120
If it emerged fully done and paddied out, it probably doesn't have the toppings you want on it.

382
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,080
It would take forever to GMO the right toppings for everybody.

383
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,640
So it would have to be designer for everybody.

384
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,280
The cost of that would be astronomical.

385
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,720
If it grew hot, you would have to pluck that baby right when it was fresh,

386
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,960
or else you're going to be eating a stale old hamburger,

387
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,560
which as anybody can tell you is terrible.

388
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
If you grow them at their uncooked point,

389
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,720
then you're talking about like a child sitting underneath the shade of their favorite burger tree,

390
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,560
and then all of a sudden, like they're just reading, and then like, just all meat falls in there.

391
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Like all rotten meat falls in their head.

392
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,720
That's not a good image.

393
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,160
Now, devil's advocate, there is grosser stuff currently growing in trees right now, this minute, than old meat.

394
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm talking about an old crabapple falls on your head and just splonches down there and ruins the book you're reading.

395
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,840
Hello.

396
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,560
You're saying that's worse than a big slimy crabby patty falling on-

397
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
Yeah, I'm not going to go with you on this one, Griffith.

398
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,760
Yeah, no way.

399
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,160
No way.

400
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,880
That's the worst thing.

401
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
A big old durian fruit falls out of a tree, hits the ground, splonk.

402
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
How's the worst smell?

403
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,920
It's not ideal.

404
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,960
Maybe the answer is we go underground and we grow them like potatoes.

405
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:43,040
Yes, so that way they're kept safe by the earth and you pull them up and maybe they're already foil wrapped.

406
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
You plant them foil wrapped, hear me out.

407
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,280
Okay.

408
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,320
You plant the bulbs foil wrapped so that when the burger forms under the ground,

409
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
it's already foil wrapped and ready for your consumption.

410
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
You don't need to worry about worms or nothing.

411
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,840
You guys are taking, and it's fun and we're having a really great time,

412
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,760
but you guys are taking a Harry Potter fucking labyrinth fucking fantasy approach to this.

413
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,600
Well, meanwhile, I'm over here googling just to make sure that the science is real on this one

414
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,200
or it could be in my lifetime.

415
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,640
You know what I mean?

416
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,240
Maybe we could be a little bit more respectful.

417
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,280
What's up, Trav?

418
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,400
I've got it.

419
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,640
As long as we're willing to bend our concept of burger a little bit,

420
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,000
a black bean burger.

421
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
It's right there.

422
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,680
It's already vegetable based.

423
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,720
Now we're cooking with gas.

424
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,520
This is good.

425
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
This is good progress.

426
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
What am bread even?

427
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,080
Wheat.

428
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,880
Hello.

429
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,360
Hello.

430
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,120
Put some of that DNA in there.

431
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,400
We grow the tomatoes in slice form.

432
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,880
DNA is in everything and it informs what the thing is.

433
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,120
Right now I'm looking at a cup, right?

434
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,640
I'm looking at a cup and it's full of water.

435
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,280
Obviously the water DNA is just H2O.

436
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,880
Like we already cracked that one.

437
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,680
The human DNA is like so complex and they won't figure that out until they, you know,

438
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,040
stem cells is like good.

439
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
But I'm looking at the cup right now.

440
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,280
And the cup is just like, what are its tea cags at?

441
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
And those are the letters that make up DNA.

442
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,920
Because maybe if a few of them were different, it would be speakers,

443
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,680
which is another thing that I'm just looking at right now.

444
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,800
Or if there were a lot more of the DNA and they were in like a really specific place,

445
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,840
it would be Griffin.

446
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,400
It would be me.

447
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Exactly.

448
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,600
The cup would be me.

449
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,880
So like, I'm saying we take the seed and we put some of the wheat DNA.

450
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,920
We put some of the black bean DNA.

451
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,440
We put some of the mayonnaise DNA.

452
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,200
That one's going to be tricky, but, and then there it is.

453
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,000
Bob's your uncle.

454
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,880
But is plant-based the way to go?

455
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,080
Cause we could spice that DNA with say like a fish and we end up with like a burger shaped

456
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,520
fish or a fish shaped burger.

457
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,160
And maybe you're going to get more of the, you know, the proteins, more of the actual

458
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,480
like goodness from like, if you had, I don't know, like you spliced it with maybe like

459
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
a rat or something like that.

460
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

461
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,160
That's horrible.

462
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,720
Let's stick with the, let's keep it edible, huh?

463
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,960
But what I don't like about the, including animal matter in the thing, I don't want to

464
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,440
look up at a tree and see like a bunch of these guys just swinging around because they

465
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,320
would be alive.

466
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,680
It's like you'd walk to continue the analogy.

467
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,840
Oh, that's too cloudy with a chance of meatball shit.

468
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,120
Well, it would be like cloudy with a chance of horror when you look up and all of these

469
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
burgers are definitely alive, right?

470
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,080
Cause they're connected to the tree and the tree is just like, a tree is basically just

471
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,360
fruit placenta.

472
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,860
Yeah.

473
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,720
And these guys would be just like flipping around, flopping around.

474
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,200
So you're under the tree reading your, reading a book and then, but then there would be like

475
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,840
just little yells, just little, little, little yelling sounds.

476
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,640
We were really quick to dismiss this, but I feel like we needed to do a little bit of

477
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,880
table setting before we even discussed the, the practicality of this.

478
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,400
So I have a question for you two and I want you to answer me honestly.

479
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,900
Okay.

480
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,120
And 90s kids will love this one.

481
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,360
Did you ever play in a burger?

482
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,020
What?

483
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
Did you ever play in a burger?

484
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
I, I haven't.

485
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,780
No.

486
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,740
Huh.

487
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,700
Hmm.

488
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,820
It's interesting, isn't it?

489
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,700
You just sort of took science at face value.

490
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:31,140
You know, Gregor Mendel would have planted a hamburger because he wasn't satisfied with

491
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,500
understanding DNA as well as we do today.

492
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,540
He couldn't do that.

493
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,380
He didn't have that luxury.

494
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,860
So he had to start from ground zero.

495
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,140
Number two was P's AGTC loving it.

496
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,500
Like just learning, learning, growing, setting the standard.

497
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,180
But before that, before that, before that.

498
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:56,100
Directly before earlier that day, the one you people don't tell you about is he planted

499
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,420
a burger and people were like, are you sure?

500
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,860
And he's like, I don't know.

501
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,940
But it starts with a question, doesn't it?

502
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,300
Three, two, one contacts.

503
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,420
Three, two, one contacts.

504
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Exactly.

505
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,940
Bloodhound gang.

506
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,900
This is what I'm saying.

507
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,020
Travis gets it.

508
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,220
90s kids.

509
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,660
Did you ever play in a hamburger?

510
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,020
How about, how about this television show that the three of us are unconsciously writing

511
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,220
together right now?

512
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,460
And it is the knack or the knick.

513
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,340
These, these doctors have a knack for killing people.

514
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,540
But it's like that where it's just like early science days, early science days, pre X-ray,

515
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,660
just figuring the shit out.

516
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,540
But instead of like doctors just like, I bet I can get that heart out of there plum quick.

517
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,140
Oops, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

518
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,060
It's Gregor Mendel.

519
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,820
And he's like, I need, I would like two burgers.

520
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,020
And so far, if most of this, some of the stuff you put in the ground, you get more of it

521
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,220
out guys, duh, burger ground.

522
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,980
I would like a, like kind of a montage of him like cutting a burger in half and floating

523
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,460
it in a jar of water and looking for like roots.

524
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,500
Just like, where is it?

525
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,100
Where the root, oh, it needs more sunshine.

526
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,700
And the show would be called The Dick.

527
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,540
It's just Gregor Mendel, Mendel planting things.

528
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,620
Well, that wouldn't be the only, that wouldn't be the only dumb experiment he does, but it

529
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,300
would be, that's an episode right there.

530
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,860
That's an episode that right, that one writes itself.

531
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,020
Or maybe it's like Gregor Mendel's brother.

532
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,180
And you like make Gregor Mendel a character who keeps coming and going, stop, just stop.

533
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,380
What are you doing?

534
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,260
Just stop.

535
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,500
And then like the series finale spoiler is like, he does it and something grows.

536
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,300
And you see like a little shoot of green credits.

537
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
I think that this is like the-

538
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,540
Coming soon to see so.

539
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,300
Coming soon to see so, The Dick.

540
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,060
The Dick, what?

541
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,700
Hey, are we married to that name?

542
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Sorry, are you married to The Dick?

543
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,580
Oh, you know I'm married to The Dick.

544
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,100
I already got the Twitter handle.

545
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,540
It's The Dick on Showtime.

546
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,460
I was very optimistic about it.

547
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:00,020
We pan up, lights up on Sandor Mendel and he is planting hamburgers everywhere.

548
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,180
French fries, yeah, those worked.

549
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,620
So he starts with French fries and he's like, okay, definitely these do work.

550
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,340
So next up, maybe I'm gonna try a hamburger.

551
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,380
And you're probably laughing at him, but there's probably somebody at home who's like,

552
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,220
I wonder how this is gonna shake out.

553
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,340
They wouldn't have made the show if there wasn't some end game to this.

554
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,700
Episode two, Gregor Mendel ties a phone to a balloon so he can talk to God.

555
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,380
No Greg, we're talking about Sandor Mendel.

556
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,860
His little brother.

557
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,740
Gregor's brother.

558
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,940
Oh yes, he's great too, very funny.

559
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,020
Very funny.

560
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,820
I'm imagining sort of Joseph Gordon-Levitt mixed with French stir.

561
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Kind of like has the good, the pretty boy looks, but also the great comic timing.

562
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,700
And the fucking bad boy.

563
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,660
Which one are we talking about?

564
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,500
Cause they're both funny and they're both adorable.

565
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,020
And that fucking bad boy body.

566
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:59,380
So the first shot, we have a shirtless Sandor Mendel and he's just grabbing whatever detritus

567
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,780
he can fit into the ground.

568
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,180
He's not even using a shovel.

569
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,660
He's so excited about this new project.

570
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,780
He's shirtless though, right?

571
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,340
Shirtless and kind of oiled up.

572
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,940
He's shirtless, but he's like digging.

573
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,460
He's been digging in the ground.

574
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,820
You know what I mean?

575
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,420
It's a hard one shirtless.

576
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,380
And we're talking primo daddy, yeah?

577
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,260
Oh yeah.

578
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,380
Yeah, yeah.

579
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm thinking the forums are gonna light up over this one.

580
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,420
Yeah, they're gonna love it.

581
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,020
If we're picking a scars guard for this role, we're definitely gonna go

582
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,180
with like an Alexander over Stellan.

583
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,940
If you know what I'm saying, Daniel.

584
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,260
Got it.

585
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,060
Yeah, a slice of man pie.

586
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,540
And the final episode of the first season is he plants his own dick.

587
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,820
And what happens is he's like, well, other things grow, please.

588
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,980
Please just this once.

589
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,580
And then that one comes out.

590
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,460
And then we, the three show runners get on Twitter like,

591
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,220
and that's why we called it that.

592
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,660
Now shut the fuck up.

593
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,660
We had a plan the whole time.

594
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,940
You guys gotta trust me for once.

595
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,780
We have seven seasons of this shit.

596
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,260
The only problem is we've gotten ahead of the guy writing the dick novels.

597
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,980
By season two, we are completely in undiscovered country at this point.

598
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,820
It is completely playing by our own rules.

599
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,420
But you know why I actually kind of like that, Justin?

600
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,500
Cause the problem was everything we did in season one,

601
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,620
people would sit there and go like,

602
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,220
I can tell you exactly what's gonna happen.

603
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,540
Or like that was different than it was in like the third chapter of the eighth book.

604
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,220
And it's like, okay, we're just, we're making a separate art piece.

605
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,260
I know that it's based on a thing, but this is a different entity.

606
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,820
We should have gone to the money zone about 10 minutes ago.

607
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,860
Our timing is a bit off this time, gang.

608
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,500
That's all right.

609
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,100
Griffin, take us there.

610
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:55,540
Okay, let me throw the lever.

611
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,060
Are we there?

612
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,180
Yeah, we're here.

613
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,860
How is it?

614
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,700
Not good so far.

615
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,540
It's kind of a slow introduction.

616
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,580
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper.

617
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,100
We've talked about Casper before.

618
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,620
Are you guys aware of Casper?

619
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,500
You know beds?

620
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,780
You know how sometimes mattresses suck?

621
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,460
You know, they're all lumpy.

622
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,300
They got springs in them or whatever.

623
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,980
Most of the time they're not.

624
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,540
Right?

625
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,420
Not from Casper.

626
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,020
I sleep on a Casper mattress every night.

627
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,820
And it's like, let's see, what can I say?

628
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,580
A realistic comparison to people.

629
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,820
It's like sleeping on a giant's dream.

630
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,940
Is that what it's like?

631
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,140
It's exactly like that.

632
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,700
And they've got a risk-free trial and return policy.

633
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,260
You can try sleeping on Casper for 100 days.

634
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,300
And it's delivered to you free in the US and Canada.

635
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,060
And it's got painless returns, which is great.

636
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,820
Because I'm sick of returning things and people making me walk on coals

637
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,940
and stabbing me with needles to return the shirt I got at Target.

638
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,020
And it comes to you in a box and you cut open the plastic

639
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,420
and it unfolds open like a giant version of those little capsules

640
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,700
you used to put in warm water and they would unfold into a space man.

641
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,780
It's like that, but a mattress you can sleep on.

642
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,380
It's every person's dream.

643
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,980
And right now there's a special offer for listeners of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

644
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,700
You can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

645
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,980
if you go to Casper.com slash My Brother

646
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,020
and use the promo code My Brother, all one word.

647
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,780
Terms and conditions apply.

648
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,500
I assume those terms and conditions are like comfy and sleepiness.

649
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,660
Yeah, if you look at the bottom of the paperwork,

650
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,740
it just says comfy sleepiness on it.

651
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,940
So that should be good.

652
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,460
So go check that out.

653
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,860
Casper.com slash My Brother, promo code My Brother, all one word.

654
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,900
What else we got, Griffin?

655
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,300
We got this one for Blue Apron, guys.

656
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,340
Blue Apron!

657
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,860
Blue Apron's the best.

658
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,820
I know of Blue Apron.

659
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,580
We talk about all the time all three of us use Blue Apron.

660
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,020
It literally changed my life.

661
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,980
It taught me how to cook.

662
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,220
I cook a couple times a week now.

663
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,580
Here's the deal.

664
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
They send you the ingredients that you need.

665
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:04,900
Fresh, amazing ingredients to cook however many meals you sign up for in a week.

666
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,300
They have various options based on your dietary habits

667
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,380
and they are incredible.

668
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
You can get stuff like ramen noodles.

669
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,140
You can get fresh heirloom tomatoes.

670
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,580
What are some of that?

671
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,660
Oh, here's some of the meals that are available in June.

672
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,100
Got spicy Korean rice cakes with snow peas and pea shoots.

673
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,180
Got sweet chili ponzu catfish and green beans with coconut ginger rice.

674
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,620
Got New England style salmon rolls with roasted potatoes and chives.

675
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,500
We, what I really like about Blue Apron is when we're signed up,

676
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,940
we get three meals every week.

677
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,180
If you're going to be out of town for a week,

678
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,020
you just get online and go to the website and say,

679
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,860
hey, I got to skip next week and they don't send you next week.

680
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,580
It's not a big deal.

681
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,460
I had to do that for E3 last week and I was heartbroken

682
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,340
to not get the delicious meals that were sent to our door.

683
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,980
I was so excited about Blue Apron.

684
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,060
I was sad I was not going to be in town to cook.

685
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,900
That is how balling Blue Apron is.

686
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,700
Anyway, if you go check out this week's menu,

687
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,820
you can get your first two meals free with free shipping

688
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,380
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

689
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,620
Again, blueapron.com slash my brother.

690
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,220
I am not being hyperbolic.

691
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,820
This is not fucking corporate shilling.

692
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,940
That shit is amazing and you should do it

693
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,300
and learn to cook and get better at cooking.

694
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,740
Okay.

695
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,180
You sold me.

696
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,660
Sure.

697
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,780
I got to read the tagline, Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

698
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,420
I'm in.

699
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,300
Sign me up.

700
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Justin, do you have a personal message?

701
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,020
Just kidding, Travis.

702
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,980
I already get Blue Apron.

703
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,620
Did you see though?

704
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,020
That's the kind of realistic emotion that I have.

705
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,860
I believed every second of it.

706
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,820
Justin, you had me.

707
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,580
I got a message from Mason and this is for Autry Johnson

708
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,540
and the message reads this.

709
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,300
If the fox jumps where the tigers play,

710
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,340
the fox will break its back.

711
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,580
And this is preferred to air before the third blood moon.

712
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,420
Yeah, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it.

713
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:50,660
Yeah.

714
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,220
We made it just barely, I think.

715
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,300
I hope Autry listens to this in time.

716
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,260
I hope Autry is not a couple episodes behind

717
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,380
or else we missed it.

718
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,100
But usually we get an email message to ask us

719
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,220
if a Jumbotron message is too weird to read.

720
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
It is a shockingly frequent occurrence.

721
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,020
Did not get a heads up on this one.

722
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,500
Yeah.

723
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,380
So hopefully someone at MaxFunHQ knows something

724
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,780
and we do not know that this is not an activation.

725
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:25,220
I'm worried that we just like read a coded like dark brotherhood contract

726
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,580
and there's somebody out there.

727
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,060
Well, Autry Johnson heard this and was like,

728
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,380
fox jumps with the tigers play, oh, okay.

729
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,660
Judge Lance Edo it is.

730
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,180
I hope we got the intonation right then.

731
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,820
Yeah.

732
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,380
I hope we didn't accidentally put the hit out on Eto.

733
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,820
Swap a word somewhere and all of a sudden Eto is going down.

734
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,100
Tigers is capitalized.

735
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
I don't know if that, does that matter?

736
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,660
Does that matter?

737
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,340
I got a message from JBW4MJB and it reads,

738
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,540
Happy first anniversary of the coolest, hottest video games husboo in the whole world.

739
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,660
Our surprise wedding was the longest con of 2015

740
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,020
and I'm glad we're working to regain the trust of our loved ones in 2016.

741
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,180
My life with you is more awesome than I ever imagined life could be

742
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,900
and I love you with all of my heart.

743
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,140
And that is so sweet.

744
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,820
And you know what the sweetest part about this is?

745
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,300
What's that?

746
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,180
We got it in the exact right window.

747
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:22,980
So there.

748
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,500
So there. My bet there is that's because JBW bought this six months in advance

749
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,660
as we have instructed all folks to do.

750
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,380
I still, every so often coming through those old emails,

751
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,980
get a, hey, today is my brother's birthday.

752
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,420
Can you say something?

753
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,020
Holler at your boy.

754
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,620
JBWMJB, congratulations on your love,

755
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,100
on your punctuality, on your foresight,

756
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,140
and on your love.

757
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,220
New to Maximum Fun, the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

758
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,060

or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds.

All sponsored by Grazex, the latest grass replacement pellet from Mitchell's.

761
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,700

Find us at maximumfun.org or on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts from.

763

And if it's not clear, this is a comedy podcast.

764
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,460
Beef out.

765
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,860
I ran into a friend in the library today while studying

766
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,100
and mentioned in passing that I was hungry.

767
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,740
He offered me some chips, which I accepted.

768
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,780
Then he pulled a family size bag of potato chips out of his bag,

769
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,260
set it down on my desk and said, here you go.

770
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,540
And then walked, sit at a table at the opposite end of the room from me.

771
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,540
Oh shit.

772
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,420
My question is how much of this bag of chips am I allowed or supposed to eat?

773
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,420
At what point do I return the bag to him?

774
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,700
That's from Delaney.

775
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,380
This is hysterical and I don't think this person got what this person just did to you.

776
00:46:53,380 --> 00:47:00,500
They turned you into a legendary like mythic figure in this library of like,

777
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,900
oh man, Dr. Munch is back.

778
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,500
How was your book?

779
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,300
Yeah, he sat there.

780
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,380
He munched for six hours.

781
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,420
How was the library?

782
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,140
Not good.

783
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,380
I was reading a book and I was getting super into it,

784
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,260
but then Dr. Munch rolled around and you know how hard it is to focus.

785
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:16,740
Yeah.

786
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,180
When Munch comes to town.

787
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,940
When Munch comes to town, starts just chowing down on his KC Masterpiece flavored Lays.

788
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,540
And just bemoaning as he walks around.

789
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,260
I don't even like the KC Masterpiece Lays.

790
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,940
Where oh where is my friend?

791
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,940
Has anyone seen my friend?

792
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,780
He left me with this burden.

793
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,780
That would be weird.

794
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,940
That's weird.

795
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,580
It's weird also that you were hungry and your friend was like,

796
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,500
do you want some chips?

797
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,780
And your friend had no obvious chips.

798
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,300
No extant chips.

799
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,060
And you're like, yeah, yeah.

800
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,820
You're saying this question asker should have been like, you don't have any chips.

801
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,900
I see no chips.

802
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,020
Is this some kind of goof?

803
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,420
This is what, oh fuck this rules.

804
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,940
This is like the best prank.

805
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,780
This is the best question we've maybe ever gotten.

806
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,420
Here's why.

807
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,020
A, it made me very happy.

808
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,660
B, library is no place for chips.

809
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,140
That's great.

810
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,660
Just the juxtaposition is really-

811
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,540
Crinkly bag, crunchy chip, fat all around.

812
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,020
C, you got a bunch of free chips.

813
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,940
That's excellent.

814
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,300
And that's arguably the best thing.

815
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,060
Like there's some bad stuff that happened too,

816
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,860
but like hang your hat on the fact that you ended this transaction

817
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,900
with a whole bunch of free chips and that's great.

818
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,020
D, it's a very-

819
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,140
Those are the best pranks, by the way.

820
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,380
Yeah.

821
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,900
The pranks where it's like, this was funny,

822
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,460
but I still ended up with something positive out of it.

823
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,580
Right, for sure.

824
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,180
D, oh, that's what I like about punk.

825
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,980
It's like, ah, we got you, but you're not really gonna die.

826
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,180
And you get to hang out with Ashton Kutcher all day, you're welcome.

827
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,220
Yeah, it's kind of like a small scale improv anywhere exercise.

828
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,380
Now D, if this was a prank, it was possibly the greatest prank of all time.

829
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,700
It was the most, it's a very abstract form of embarrassment.

830
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,460
You have a very large bag of chips in a place where those shouldn't be.

831
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,740
Although really, gang, I would challenge anyone to think about a place

832
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,940
where it'd be acceptable to just like go hog

833
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,540
on a big old family-sized bag of Bakelays by yourself.

834
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,820
Like there is no, like what's the place on earth

835
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,260
with like the least amount of like a baseball game?

836
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,500
Still, no, put the big bag away.

837
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,900
There are smaller bags that are made for this occasion.

838
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,540
The way I can prove it's a prank is

839
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:37,780
is no one puts a family-sized bag of chips into their bag

840
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,860
that was not planning their afternoon around eating those chips.

841
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,620
Like you don't just like just in case bring along

842
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,660
a family-sized bag of KC Masterpiece Lays.

843
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,900
And if you were, you don't hand them off

844
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,900
and then lose contact with them.

845
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,740
You're mama birding that shit to make sure you get back

846
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,380
for your planned a chip feast later on that afternoon.

847
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,260
You have got it on an emotional tether at all times.

848
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,100
Are we all three assuming, sorry, real quick,

849
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,980
are we all three assuming that this bag was unopened

850
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,900
when delivered to said friend?

851
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,940
If not, then I just, I know,

852
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,860
because this question actually seems like

853
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,540
just a really solid sturdy person.

854
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,860
They would have said, put that back in your bag.

855
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:22,740
Okay.

856
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,740
I don't need, I'm not gonna eat your big open bag of chips.

857
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,700
Thank you, those could be very old.

858
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,500
I have, one of the things about having

859
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,060
an almost two-year-old living in my house now

860
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,500
is that if a package is returned to the cupboard,

861
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,100
then when I extract it from the cupboard

862
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,220
and start enjoying it,

863
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,220
say I'm about to enjoy some goldfish,

864
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,100
a lot of times I'll get an unopened

865
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,180
or I'll get a pre-opened package out of the cupboard

866
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,460
and I'll begin enjoying it

867
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,500
and I'll notice my wife give me kind of like a side eye,

868
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,300
like, oh, that's, oh, okay.

869
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,660
And I'll ask her like, what's up?

870
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,260
And she'll inform me that my daughter had licked

871
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,860
some of them or jammed too many in her mouth

872
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,340
and put them back in the bag.

873
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,740
Cool, cool.

874
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,380
So it's like, to me, in my house,

875
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,580
if I see something opened, it doesn't exist anymore.

876
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:16,980
Yeah.

877
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,180
I'm just gonna throw it away.

878
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,100
That is marked to be thrown away in the garbage later

879
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,260
because there's no way I'm gonna try to like

880
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,740
like pan for that kind of gold.

881
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,380
No, thank you.

882
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,100
You don't have like an idea of like

883
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,460
how to get the sticky stuff out?

884
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,380
You don't have a-

885
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,420
What do you mean?

886
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,860
You know, you reach in and you touch it

887
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,780
and it's obviously which ones have been baby mouthed

888
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,220
and so you don't eat those ones.

889
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,940
I don't see what the big deal is.

890
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,380
Well, I'll tell you what, Griffin,

891
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,900
when you come to Huntington's-

892
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,500
No, I appreciate the fucking protest.

893
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,180
I'll have you rifle through my fucking snacks

894
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,460
and just plink out the ones that my baby ate.

895
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,180
Well, you don't need me.

896
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,500
You could get like a sandpiper or something.

897
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,300
Pour them out in a bowl and you say,

899
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,340
Mr. Sandpiper, go for it.

900
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,020
And that sandpiper will get the good ones out.

901
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,540
Of course, then you'll have to contend with the sand fleas.

902
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,620
Maybe I could dump them all out in a single layer,

903
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,940
turn off all the lights and then spray them with luminol.

904
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,260
Yeah.

905
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,740
And then the ones that reacted to the luminol,

906
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,180
I could safely dispose of.

907
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,780
Not just any luminol, sour cream and chives luminol.

908
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,260
CSI baby touching.

909
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,980
That's kind of like a treat to me at the end, right?

910
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,220
Because it's like, well, I had to spray these all with luminol,

911
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
but at least they're zesty.

912
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,460
What if you spread them out and you spray luminol all over them

913
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,660
and then you put a black light over them

914
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,580
and it spells out, Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

915
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,540
I love you so much.

916
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,780
Oh, my God, baby geniuses.

917
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,020
You didn't even think about baby geniuses' craft work.

918
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,220
Do you ever think about whether or not Charlie's a baby genius?

919
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,500
But I'm not saying smart.

920
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,180
I mean, like, can talk.

921
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:42,740
From the movie.

922
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,660
Can talk when you're not around.

923
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,820
To dogs.

924
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,460
Can dance.

925
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,020
Can break dance.

926
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,420
Can dance.

927
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,980
Can break dance.

928
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,300
Can't steal the Constitution with Nick Cage.

929
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,620
Can understand complex humor and satire.

930
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,540
Does have, oh, sorry, Trav.

931
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,860
If I could just have a moment of your time away from the podcast.

932
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,860
Were you, for a second, implying that in the film Baby Geniuses,

933
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,740
there was, and I believe I'm quoting it directly,

934
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,700
complex humor and satire in the Baby Geniuses films?

935
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,980
Oh, I mean, if you look at it, Justin,

936
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,060
I think it's supposed to be that they made an inverse

937
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,140
in which the babies act more adults

938
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,980
and the adults act more childish

939
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,620
and it's kind of turning our whole society on its ear.

940
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,220
So I think when viewed through that lens,

941
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,980
you will find that the Baby Genius movie,

942
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,900
which admittedly I have not seen,

943
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,140
is a real cutting commentary on the American government.

944
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,860
Okay, Trav, if you could,

945
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,380
maybe you could go through sort of precedent for me

946
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,300
and name some other comedies that were,

947
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,380
that were, you know, real thinkers,

948
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,460
like really challenging material

949
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,060
that featured prominently little people

950
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,860
pretending to be babies with babies heads superimposed over.

951
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,780
I'm gonna say that's Baby's Day Out.

952
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,140
Did not happen in that movie, that was a real baby.

953
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,380
Let's see, what else?

954
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,700
What was that, Rugrats?

955
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,460
The live action Rugrats they made

956
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,980
that was never released in America.

957
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh, right, the Japanese Rugrats with live babies.

958
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,140
Yeah, that was little people with babies superimposed over them.

959
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,180
And also-

960
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,260
How did that not scrub the Baby Geniuses project?

961
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,340
When they're in their first pre-pro meeting

962
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,980
and one person's like, I got one way we could do it,

963
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,660
how did someone say like, well,

964
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
we have to come up with a better way than that

965
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,860
or we can't make this film?

966
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,660
I'm sorry, Doug, what the fuck did you just say?

967
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,740
We can't make the film because the one way we have to do it

968
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,660
is the absolute pits.

969
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,340
Obviously, in the first focus test,

970
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,100
somebody was just like, I just hate this.

971
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,740
Ah, man, I just really hate looking at this.

972
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,700
I saw the concept art and I hated that

973
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,260
and then I saw some of the stills and I hated that the most

974
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,260
and you've got two whole hours on celluloid for this.

975
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,700
Excuse me, producers, how did this get made?

976
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,140
Well, we shot 90% of it except for that

977
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,340
and we kept thinking we'd come up with a better answer

978
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,140
other than superimposing baby heads

979
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,060
onto adult little people's bodies

980
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:20,020
and we didn't and then we were kind of pot committed.

981
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,540
I have a question that will consume the rest of your days

982
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,780
and the rest of the days of the listeners of the show.

983
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,940
So if you would like to not listen to this question,

984
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,380
just skip ahead 30 seconds.

985
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,580
But if you're a little person performer

986
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,900
and you are performing as one of the baby geniuses

987
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,660
and you know that your face will be superimposed

988
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,660
over with a baby's face,

989
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:51,540
what do you do with your face while you are performing?

990
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:57,940
There are several different options.

991
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,740
Each one is worse than the one before it.

992
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,420
It is a Russian nesting doll of just like existential horror

993
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,900
of like, what do you do with your face

994
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,020
while you are performing as the baby body?

995
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,260
There had to be one actor who like committed face

996
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,940
to match what they were doing

997
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,060
as though it would not be superimposed with a baby face

998
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,420
while all the actors were like,

999
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,700
can you fucking believe Doug?

1000
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,780
Can you believe Doug?

1001
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,780
He's doing baby faces.

1002
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,380
Like what the fuck, Doug?

1003
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,260
By the way, I wanna make it 100% clear.

1004
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,780
I lay no blame at the fault of the little people

1005
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,340
that perform in this film as the babies.

1006
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,660
You get that money and you make Hollywood pay

1007
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,340
for what they've done to you for generations.

1008
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,940
I'm with you on that.

1009
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,220
I stand in unity.

1010
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
I'm just curious, what did you do with your face

1011
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,300
the whole time?

1012
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,780
Because there's like blank, is that good?

1013
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,260
It's just like complete deadpan,

1014
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,340
just like Buster Keaton stone face.

1015
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,340
Like, could you smile?

1016
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:58,660
Why?

1017
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:00,980
Why would I?

1018
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,780
Exactly, give me a reason to smile ever again

1019
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,260
and I'll light up this room with these pearly whites.

1020
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,140
So that's gonna do it for us here on,

1021
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,140
remember me, we hope you've had a lot of fun

1022
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,220
listening to the program.

1023
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,860
We sure have had a lot of fun talking to you

1024
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,660
for this past hour.

1025
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,660
We love you very much.

1026
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,500
And thank you as always for listening.

1027
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,620
You're a real champ.

1028
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,940
I have a fun thing that I'm gonna be doing

1029
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,020
that I wanted to make sure everyone knew about.

1030
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,340
Coming up this Friday, the 24th,

1031
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,100
Geek and Sundry, along with Smart Girls of the Party,

1032
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:39,620
Amy Poehler's project, is doing a 24 hour variety show

1033
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,380
live streaming to benefit the muscular dystrophy charity,

1034
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,020
MDA, and I'm gonna be performing in the first hour of it

1035
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,140
starting at 7 p.m.

1036
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,660
And I want everybody to like check that out.

1037
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,020
I don't have the-

1038
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,300
7 p.m. what time zone?

1039
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,100
Oh, 7 p.m. Pacific time, Friday night.

1040
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,660
I don't have the URL yet,

1041
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,500
but I will be tweeting it and pushing it

1042
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,260
and I want everybody to come check that out.

1043
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,660
So do that.

1044
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,460
It's gonna be fun.

1045
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,220
Um, I want to thank Sean Roderick

1046
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,660
and the Long Winters for using our theme song.

1047
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,820
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1048
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,500
It's a wonderful album you should go listen to.

1049
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,100
And hey, go to MaximumFun.org

00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,900
I also wanted everyone to know

1061
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,300
we're doing that live show in Boston

1062
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,300
and we are working on a new poster for that

1063
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,780
that is gonna just blow all of you away.

1064
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,500
It's gonna knock your socks so far off.

1065
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,060
Yeah, really excited.

1066
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,580
You won't ever find them again.

1067
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,780
Uh, is that it?

1068
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,500
Anything else?

1069
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,820
Uh, real quick, because we haven't recorded again

1070
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,860
since it happened.

1071
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
Uh, I wanna say a big congratulations

1072
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,020
to our friend Lin-Manuel Miranda

1073
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,420
for his, uh, multiple Tony wins.

1074
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,980
Uh, congratulations, Lin.

1075
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,780
Many Tonys.

1076
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,100
Hey, look, I look forward to holding that Tony

1077
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,900
and seeing how fast I can make the little medallion spin

1078
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,340
a dream come true.

1079
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,100
I look forward to snapping that out

1080
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,540
when you're not looking, Lin,

1081
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,820
and then taking it home

1082
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,220
for the world's most radical Pog Slammer.

1083
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,060
Pog Slammer, the world's most radical

1084
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,380
and the world's most prestigious

1085
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,820
Tony Boney Pog Slammer.

1086
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,260
They call him Tony Boney

1087
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,940
and he's the best slammer around.

1088
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,740
Who you got on your Pogs today, Alf?

1089
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,380
Huh, that's neat.

1090
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,980
They're mine now, idiot.

1091
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,900
Should've known better.

1092
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,100
This thing's heavy as fuck.

1093
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,460
And prestigious as shit.

1094
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,380
It's super prestigious, but more importantly,

1095
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,460
it slams like a motherfucker.

1096
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,540
Lin, right now, is looking at his Tonys.

1097
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,500
He does have more than one.

1098
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,620
I could spare one.

1099
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,500
I could spare one.

1100
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,940
Oh, I'll break one of these bad boys down.

1101
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,740
This is a Yahoo!

We live in a world with too much media.

1120
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,820
