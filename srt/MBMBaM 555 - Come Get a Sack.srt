1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:29,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,180
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,080

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Hello

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,360
It's such a delight to talk to you griff. We haven't talked since your you got a new son

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,160
I got one. I got a I'd put it. I did a pre-order on a new son and

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,740
Yeah, I got a brand new son. I got great pre-order bonuses

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Like see I decided to wait until they could fix all the bugs. Yeah, but this one's got a

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
glitch or two

18
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah, this one's got this one's got a few it needs a little bit more QA, you know what I'm saying

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,040
vis-a-vis diaper stuff, but we're all happy to be here. A couple leaks

20
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,200
There's been a few leaks to the press on this one

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,340
And no, I just love them two bits and I'm just really

22
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm stoked. I'm stoked to be here stoked for you guys had a great episode last week. That was big and then

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,920
You know yahoo set my fucking house on fire with me and my family inside of it

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,280
Yeah, which was cool with them

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,080
Like I was like, I just got the kid to sleep and he saw him dreaming having smiles and what's he dreaming about?

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't know cuz he doesn't fucking know anything

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,360
So like I was thinking about that and the and then yahoo came and burned my house down

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
And I thought that that was pretty fucked up

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,640
Personally speaking they what I mean, I can't I don't want to make too much for the thing out of it

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,960
But you definitely know that they were waiting until they knew yeah, sure

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,720
No question hard for it not to feel targeted. Yeah, it feels very targeted

32
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,960
like I don't know how at least I guess I talked about it on the podcast that you know that I was gonna be out the

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
following week and then

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,320
Marissa is that the yahoo I get or did Verizon do it?

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Was it the can you hear me now guy? Who the fuck do I need to like intimidate?

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
To stop this thing

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,440
Because I'm not done like I'm not done fighting if you think I am that you because this is your first episode listening to my brother

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,200
My brother I mean Griffin is getting to vote every waking moment from this point on. Yeah, he's got nothing

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,600
He's clear to schedule. Yeah, and what's great about it is that I have a lot more waking moments now

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Than I did, you know a couple weeks ago

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,200
So I'm not fucking kidding. I

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,120
I I don't know what I don't know what it looks like

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
This this campaign. I've never really done one like this before

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,120
I mean there was that one time I tried to get the show ed back on the air and I

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,240
Cuz it that was the only shit made me happy and

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,320
For that one you asked that everyone send a bowling alley to NBC

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,100
Every that was the first step and the second step is they had to change their everybody legally changed their names to Ed

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,280
But one word like Prince

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,480
anyway

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm just so fucking happy to be here guys. You did a great episode last week. Oh, thanks Griff

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,920
We recorded that, you know a couple years back, but it was nice to finally get it out there. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
I have a I have a bit of a big announcement to you

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Yeah, well, it's come to my attention that and this is gonna really be hard for you guys

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,000
There's gonna be a shock for you guys to hear. This is feeling like a bit

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
No, no, no that that

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,200
Apparently there are some folks out there who don't think

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,040
that

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Sad lives and riddle me piss

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
And and play along at home are funny. All right. All right

60
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,040
And so I decided and this is hard to say but to temporarily

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,400
Permanently temporarily put them on hiatus. Okay. All right, and in place I've got a new a new segment here

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,040
Down and Travis I do want you to know that I am going to be judging this thinking of it as the thing that is

63
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Gonna replace yahoo answer so a bit that we do three to four times per episode

64
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,560
So absolutely bring the fuck bring the fuck ins bring that stinky heat. I think you will see Griffin this

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,080
Has legs. All right, they Sam so it's called work of fart. All right

66
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,440
This is gonna be so good. I'm already fucking excited. Yeah, the dog is back

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,440
So what we've got here what what I've done here is I've taken some

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
Classic literary works, right?

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,800
But I've taken their titles and I've pund them so that they contain a word referencing

70
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,840
feces

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,680
Travis this is nice is a fucking bad idea man

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
So I will I will give you I'll give you the description

73
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,920
Travis I love you so much. Uh-huh. You know my love for you the size of it. Yeah. Yeah, I do

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,520
Tell me how much you think I love you to the moon and back Griffin. That's from the

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,240
Bullshit, that's bullshit. You fucking nut brown hair. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about how much I love you

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,640
It's so much I do anything for you. And that's not a dog out of his cage, please dog

77
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:48,040
Come on out. So I will give you the description of the book you try to guess the punny title. Okay, okay

78
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Wait, wait, wait, hold on

79
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,480
You're okay. Yes. Okay. I understand the bit. Yes. Okay. Yes. This is the story of

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,660
multiple towns made of feces

81
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,420
Yes, this is a little too shitty. Oh so close tale of poo cities, but

82
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Yes, very good

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,560
Very good. Like my wife's not very good. We've got it wrong. My wife listens to this show

84
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Oh when you need to murder a poop that's been making fun of you

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,360
To kill a mocking turd. Yes

86
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,100
But it sucks though, like I fucking hate that I got it. It's comedy boy

87
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,500
Now this is gonna be a tough one this is gonna be a tough one cuz there's

88
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,460
Like we're better than dookie humor though

89
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,780
I did this book in summer reading and so I have to assume that it is well-known enough it just a plain old anus

90
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,180
Just a plain old anus, this is a tough one. Wait, I think I got it

91
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,620
Is it ordinary butthole ordinary poop hole

92
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,740
Okay, and this was just a bonus one a Stephen King horror novel that takes

93
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Maybe uncomfortable to be in that

94
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,420
Yeah

95
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,940
Griffin complained the most about that bit. I got every single

96
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,460
Like fucking Deathstroke the Terminator Charles could barely get about yeah was blown about the air. Yeah

97
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,620
No, I feel like you're afraid of being on that wavelength

98
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,500
But you are deeply deeply genetically connected to it

99
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,260
Like, you know, it's there no, but it's just we it's just our comedy is there. It means a lot to people

100
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,580
And so we when we just talk about

101
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,300
just

102
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
My wife listens to this show

103
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,940
And my worry Griffin is that we've been too

104
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,500
Intellectual for the whole time, right? And I think it would be nice if we had one segment that was just pure aisle

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,180
Yeah, that was just that one or maybe yeah, I have slightly less

106
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
I don't know

107
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,340
Intellectual slightly less highbrow audience. We do a lot of Fraser jokes

108
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,140
Yeah, and those are done now work of art

109
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,900
I can't believe you said that word actually out loud because we made certain assurances to our audience

110
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,620
I just want to say let's not let's let's put a pin in it

111
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,900
And keep workshopping it ultimately though. We're not gonna need to replace

112
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,020
The yahoo answers segments because it's not the website is not going to go away

113
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
It's not denial

114
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,860
And what's great is it and a lot of people won't tell you this is that if you stay on

115
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,780
Denial and don't do like the least the less fun

116
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,220
stages of grief. Mm-hmm, then

117
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:04,900
It's okay. You can just chill on tonight. You know what? I mean like denial. Okay anger. Oh, no one wants to be angry depression

118
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,500
I don't think so bargaining can be kind of fun

119
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,580
But denial if you just live there for a bit then it's like it did way better than acceptance way better

120
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,320
Well, you know, it's not a shorter road to ho

121
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,500
Yeah, you know Griffin I heard what you just if you just stay

122
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,620
Like with the tab open for yahoo answers. Oh, they even when they quote-unquote shut it down. You're still in there

123
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,540
That's it. Last one out turn off the turn out the lights

124
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,200
Well, they can't come to my computer and turn off my screen because that's not how a computer would work

125
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,160
They can't get rid of all the floppies that you saved the entire website on to

126
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,000
Exactly. Can I start with it? Yeah, can I read it? Yeah, well I say start

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,540
This is the set now the second bit in the show third if you count the intro and then Travis's new segment

128
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,080
Is a yahoo and I want it. Can I read it?

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Well, this one's sent in by the wizard Ben can't thank you. Thank you, Ben. It's yahoo answers user slip who asks

130
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,220
Could the president get a sick face tattoo?

131
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,000
This post isn't about politics. Oh, thank God

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,180
Could the president get a sick face tattoo Congress arguably has no power to stop the president from just hopping into a tattoo parlor

133
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,840
And getting some rad tats on their face

134
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,100
No, if they wanted to could the president United States get their face absolutely tatted up and I will extend this to

135
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
full

136
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,380
You know cheetah sleeves like the whole nine. I actually think okay. I

137
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Griffin I think that that is actually two different

138
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,600
Things right because imagine a president and like I'm not talking about the current president

139
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm saying like kind of a faceless amorphous idea of

140
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,800
President capital a president and rolls up there's been oh no, there's been a tornado, right?

141
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,120
Devastation everywhere president rolls up looks around rolls up their sleeves and starts picking shit up with their

142
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,040
Like with it's fucking awesome. Like it's just fucking sleeves all the way up. Like I mean has anybody ever seen

143
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,520
President Joe Biden with his shirt off

144
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,040
Hey, let me ask. Hey, hey, hey. Hey guys. Hey, let me ask you a question. Okay?

145
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,080
You ever seen a picture of Joe Biden with his shirt off

146
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Let's head to Google. Can somebody can don't Google it

147
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,120
Can someone give me a picture of Joe Biden shirtless, please?

148
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Can I have a new detain? Can I can I have a nude Biden, please?

149
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,300
So we've got an onion article is the top result. Oh, then it's not then it's they already did it

150
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,000
They already did the damn joke say Justin. Hey juice as long as you're on the onion

151
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,860
Can you check and see if they did a thing where they replaced the words of book titles with poop synonyms?

152
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,840
Just check and see if they did that one already too

153
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,240
I'm hitting a paywall guys. There's a paywall, you know, it's right. It's so good

154
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,880
They they're charging for it. That's if the president already has sleeve tattoos, right? You never hear about like

155
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
today the president went to

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,080
The tattoo parlor and got a cool and got a cool tattoo on his face

157
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,720
I say though that if you're the president though, and you brought that pole

158
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,360
I think I get Banksy to like do your face tattoo. Yeah, sure. I think you could definitely probably get Banksy to do your face

159
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
tattoo because I bet Banksy

160
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,720
Would love that real estate to like say something all but fucking Banksy though. He would say you would write something like

161
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
President shithead on him

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,800
See it or I guess straight words cuz then he couldn't read it in the mirror cuz the mirror mirror makes things backwards

163
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,320
Oh like war pig. Oh, that's

164
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,440
That's great. But like we get him but like from his perspective maybe like it's on his chin

165
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,800
So when he looks down on it, it says like great Biden on it, or maybe it's yeah

166
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Maybe it's like I feel don't know that great Biden backwards is war pig

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,120
No, it's one of the it's like you you know that that font where you look at one way and it's like life and you look

168
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,020
At the other way, it's like go death. You know what I mean?

169
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,680
Like that kind of thing and one way it's war pig in the other way. It's great Biden

170
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,320
Great by didn't or maybe it's just like a rhombus. Is there a rebate?

171
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,440
What where it's just like a picture of a jet plus?

172
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Rebo

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,320
It's a Prius it's a Prius and Joe Biden's look at the Prius and he's like plane hog

174
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
It's like yeah. Yeah. Yeah plane hog

175
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,360
regular hog

176
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,960
Plane old hog man. I talk about Reince Priebus lie. He was chief of staff further our previous

177
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
Stinker of a president and I didn't I guess I didn't know the gentleman's

178
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,300
Back background, but that's one of few days. It's going a few days, but

179
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He could he'd look pretty good with some

180
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,600
tattoos

181
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Let me see if there's a shirtless Priebus

182
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Can I get shirtless?

183
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Right the biggest risk would be that if the president one day got face tattooed somebody invoking the

184
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
25th right back

185
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,280
I don't know about this, but I think that depends on what you got like what the tattoo is

186
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, if it's bitchin if it's bitchin. Yeah, come back. Oh

187
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,440
Then maybe like the the opposition's like I guess we should pass that bill

188
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,880
Mm-hmm. Look how cool they look right that could be a power if it just comes back and it's oh and it's bitchin

189
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,040
Yeah, they don't they don't talk about that a lot of just like oh man

190
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,640
They passed this really unpopular bill that sucks, but Ted Cruz looked so cool today

191
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,040
And so we had like we did his well, that's the realm of fiction Griffin. That's never going to happen

192
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,120
I don't know man. You seen that beard. That's a dude who doesn't piss his pants anymore because he likes the feeling of the warm

193
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,360
Water on his legs. He's moved on from that. He likes big. Yeah. Hey, he likes big boy stuff now

194
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,560
like like he likes fucking he's he's what currently watching the wire and also

195
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,380
And he gets why everyone liked it. He's a man now. He's a real man. He's a real big man. This man eats ribs

196
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah

197
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,480
With extra sauce something he loves more than eating a rib while I he pees in his pants

198
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,920
No, no joke. No, I don't do that anymore Justin

199
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,920
His favorite Disney Park is California adventure

200
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,320
He's a real man. I heard he saw the Joker and he was like this makes a lot of sense to me

201
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,680
And I get it. He got damaged tattooed on his head

202
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes, and that's why they passed his big bill. I didn't want him to do it. It's me Ted

203
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,040
Sorry, I can't talk on the phone now. Me and my daughters are watching Reservoir Dogs. We're not scared at all

204
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,520
I can watch all the Reservoir Dogs and I don't get scared even a little bit on a school night

205
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,920
On a school night? It's fucking Thursday, baby. Yeah, it's 1115

206
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,640
I got another five to ten in me. Don't let this party stop. And we door-dashed

207
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,400
BW3s. I got the spicy wings. Yeah, not number tens, but it's like a seven out of ten on the school scale

208
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, I couldn't do like the you know, the blazons, but it's hot man. These are not milds

209
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,280
Some days my distaste for Ted Cruz is the only thing keeps me going. Oh for sure. Yeah last night

210
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,600
I was like blacking out trying to get my son to to please drink this bottle

211
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,280
Please drink this bottle and then I was I started to actually pass out and then I remembered how much I fucking hate Ted Cruz

212
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,800
And it it gave me a real a real boost of adrenaline that I couldn't quite explain

213
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,120
It's funny because sometimes I feel like my hatred of Ted Cruz and my hatred of Mike Huckabee

214
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,780
They like to fight like imagine if a giant gorilla

215
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:13,220
Yeah, I'm like a giant lizard. We're fighting for supremacy. Yeah, except the end result was which one of these two

216
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:21,180
Absolute dipshits do I hate more right now? That's kind of where I'm at. You know, I really hope this doesn't come off as performative gang

217
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,220
I really fucking hate Ted Cruz a lot. He sucks major shit big time. Yeah, big time. Yeah

218
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Hey, how about it's me? Yes

219
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,980
Question. Yeah, I wanted I was about to deliver one. Okay for the first time in my life. I have an awesome office job

220
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,660
It's how long I've been podcasting came as the office anymore. I've got an office job

221
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,580
My boss strives for close-knit and fun vibe

222
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,200
Oh, I however don't aim to be very social at work the other day

223
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,720
I made a joke in front of my boss and he said I should channel that energy more awesome

224
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,180
How can I come across this fun-loving and social when I am NOT and that's from grouching Grand Rapids

225
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:08,700
Hey, do you hear this one? Do you hear what Tom said? He said where do where do cows go to look at art the

226
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,020
Museum channel that energy more time. Hey, hey. Hey, I know your whole thing

227
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,180
Quiet guy, right?

228
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,900
No, don't do that. I want one joke a day on my desk

229
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,380
I want you to come on my office once a day and tell me a joke right down the barrel baby, or you're fucking fired

230
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
I

231
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,560
You're gonna have fun at work are you gonna have fun at home? Yes, these are two choices

232
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:41,140
We've already got a Toby. We've already got an Oscar. We need a gym here. You're that Jim

233
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,540
I just walked by your desk. I looked in the trashcan

234
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,300
And I saw all the couch balls. I gave you yesterday to have fun with in the office. I'm fucking fuming man

235
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,340
I know you don't see here. Are you sitting huh? Are you sitting on a regular chair?

236
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,640
I thought we said exercise balls. Do we not say exercise balls?

237
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,620
Hey, you haven't even open the nerf hoop. Hey

238
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
That's nerf. Hope I got it for you

239
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,460
$7 the money doesn't go on trees and then your neuro folks, but they might go on your door. Just put a nerf hoop up

240
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,540
It kind of seems like you're always working hard and you're almost never hardly working. Yeah

241
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,340
Um, it's important that we do both. I know you're meeting all your quotas just barely but do you have time for softball?

242
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,900
This is not asked for ten minutes a day

243
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,140
For joke construction and oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's saying this is fine. I will bring this energy

244
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:43,580
I'm gonna need ten minutes paid on the clock to come up with a fucking banger and then a five-minute cooldown after

245
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,680
right and

246
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,460
It's just they walk by your desk and it's like what do you listen to there? And it's it's funny stand-up comedy from

247
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,820
Everybody's favorite comedians like Andrew Dice Clay

248
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,460
Just listen to some greatest hits it's it's oh man Andrew Dice Clay again, huh? Yeah, I guess so

249
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,620
Yeah, damn. I had to Google the best the

250
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:15,020
Famous comedians to do that. I found a list and fucking Michael Richards is number 12 on the list. Are you sure guys? I'm back

251
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,580
Well, oh wait. Yeah. Wait, what was this search term?

252
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,820
Wife will beg it. This is the most controversial comedians of all time and all of a sudden. This makes a lot more sense

253
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,900
Yeah, it's up there

254
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:34,020
Yeah, the fact that Andrew Dice Clay and Michael Richards is on the list Griffin made me wonder what your search terms were

255
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,000
I searched cool guys

256
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:47,420
Cool guys to hang out with Griffin's personal heroes folks with a real hearty funny bone

257
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Comedy like it used to be

258
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,380
Classic like your grandpa laughed at right, right

259
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
This sucks so bad

260
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,820
Yeah, but maybe there's something in you know, you did crack one joke and it does make you wonder maybe there's a

261
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,860
Joker deep down inside of you, you know kind of a funny boy. Oh, yeah

262
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,940
Okay, and you got a awakened nerd. Why don't you just try to nurture your funny boy? I'm just saying do it on company time

263
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:23,240
Yeah, for sure to channel that energy. Oh, this is good because like at best you find a funny within right?

264
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,900
And now you're another funster, right?

265
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,740
But at worst you're not good at it and maybe your boss will be like, hey don't channel that energy anymore

266
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:39,220
Hey, I see you working really hard to channel that energy. You need you to stop channeling that energy. Yeah, you're too funny

267
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,940
Well get anything done. I am kind of fixated on this sentence. I

268
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,500
However, don't aim to be very social at work. That's a very interesting about a boundary you've set for yourself

269
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah, like you got to work and you're like I get this I get it. I'm just not gonna I

270
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,700
Don't know. I'm not I'm really not gonna connect with anybody

271
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,380
Versus a level. This is the decision I've made. I will say I kind of get so I am a very social person, right?

272
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,500
but when I had office jobs, I would oftentimes be like the first person there and

273
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,420
There was a certain magic right up until the first time I had to interact with somebody, right?

274
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,820
Cuz even though I was there that time was mine. Oh, you know now it's my like hangout

275
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm there doing the thing and as soon as someone else came in it's like, oh, hey Travis was like, oh

276
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,540
Now it's worth just working. I get that so I think if I got an office job now

277
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,780
I would see if I could go the whole day without that

278
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,340
I think that that would be a very fun game to see how long I could go without

279
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,140
encountering

280
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,700
Another person they don't have that option. It doesn't yeah. Well, that's a side. That's open to them. You know, it's

281
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,420
Well, well, hold on. It sounds like Travis has like a scheme

282
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,660
I'm just saying that like maybe that's the thing the energy you could start to channel is

283
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,500
A lot more maybe like doing your work from hidden places from the vents

284
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,820
The work is getting done, but they never see who does it. That's cool

285
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,220
That's that and then they're chatting in the break room like hey, did you see WandaVision last night?

286
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,180
And they're like that show went off the air like a month ago Griffin

287
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,520
You should learn some new television shows and then you reach over to take a bite of your sandwich, but it's gone

288
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,500
Yep, and then you look over at the nearby vent and it's sliding closed and you know, that's Terry

289
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,900
Yep, he doesn't write Terry the vent person this office bad boy and local person that lives

290
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
and wall person

291
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
Um

292
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,460
How about another do you have more yahoo? I feel like it's now a non-renewable resource

293
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,660
Yeah, sure. Let me burn some of my some of my fuel here. How about I ask another question?

294
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,620
We'll save now cuz this one's this one's really fucking good. No, I read it

295
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,820
It's also from Ben Ben can't the wizard really cast a spell on me this week with these great yahoos

296
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,220
There's just a thing

297
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,780
There's an alert at the top of the page now that says that they're gonna shut down on May 4th

298
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,460
They it's shutting down on May 4th

299
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,740
But starting on April 20th the sacred holiday for weed funny stuff

300
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,700
It is when they are not gonna allow you to write any more questions

301
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:22,180
So really that's pretty much when it dies doesn't that make you think that that's their highest traffic day then they're like, yeah

302
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,340
We don't want to go through another 420. Do you guys think it's kind of weird that like I

303
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
Don't want to I don't want to distract but

304
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,180
May 4th will now be the day that Yahoo answer shut down and the day that we did the worst live show

305
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,940
We've ever done or that anyone's ever done in their entire life

306
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,940
And I feel like maybe we need to be a little bit. I'm starting to get like I love Star Wars

307
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,060
Yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm starting to get a little skittish about that date

308
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,260
Cuz this is the second really bad thing that's happened on a May 4th. Yeah

309
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,700
Okay, I it's hard for me to hold that against Star Wars Justin cuz you know Phantom Menace just means so much to me

310
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,500
Travis loves that flick. We agree that them

311
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,380
Stopping new questions on 420 and then shutting it down on Star Wars days fucking it's pretty fun

312
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
Really targeted yeah, it's good

313
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,340
But I do like that

314
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,740
I do like that they thought we'll leave two weeks where people to finish answering the questions that are already there. Oh, dude

315
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,340
It's read only you're not even answering shit. It's just like we're gonna give you two weeks to fucking

316
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,500
Brush up on all the great stuff. I

317
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,500
Hope the thing that you wanted to know is something that somebody else has also wanted to know and asked on Yahoo answers and that

318
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
helpful people

319
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Beating the odds came to their assistance. You have two weeks. Good luck. The fucking hunt is on. Good luck rat race

320
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,780
Sure, yeah, thank you Ben can't it's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm gonna call

321
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,140
Jeffy asks

322
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,220
Do all cowboys kill or do some have a no kill rule like superheroes?

323
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
Hmm

324
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Okay, yeah

325
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,780
There's a lot of bad. There's a lot of bad cowboys out there who like quicken the dead

326
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,220
They're like shooting each other and they're not getting back up. They're yeah, they are they are dead

327
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,380
And they're shooting each other in that movie without any kind of hesitation. Yeah as fast as they can

328
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
It's kind of the thing

329
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,520
Significance seven. I think one of them like shoots a dynamite and blows up a bunch of guys. So yeah

330
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:34,460
Those guys are dead. You can't tell me they're not dead. That's TNC. Is this is this a a

331
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:41,500
Like zero or all thing of like what if a cowboy just kills once is that?

332
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:49,700
Then are they a killer or are they just like a murdering one person makes you a murderer. Okay? Okay, okay

333
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm just saying that like on the scale, right? Yeah

334
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,900
They're probably some cowboy like maybe that there is a margin for cowboy murder

335
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,740
No, it's just an acceptable level like well that cowboy only killed five people when they be cool

336
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,020
if like more cowboy movies ended with like

337
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,900
The the police showing up and they're like, what have you all done? Yeah, there are still laws. You can't do this

338
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,220
well, I think most I think the

339
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,620
All West police are in are embroiled in this in the all you needed back then was a star a metal star

340
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,780
That's true. Whatever you want. Yeah, what if the real cops showed up and like we're excuse me

341
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:33,020
We're the real police and this is a person with a metal star on their chests and they're going to real jail. I

342
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,420
Think that there should be more cowboy movies in which the cow yes period but also that the cowboys do kill

343
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:47,580
But with kindness and you don't see that I think cowboy movies where the bad guys like I'm taking over this whole town

344
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,520
Railroads coming through here. This is mine and the Cowboys are like

345
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Okay, we'll help you move and clean up and maybe we'll show you thing about what it means to really love

346
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,580
Oh, I thought you were talking about like cowboy hospice

347
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
Which I don't know what that looks like

348
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,020
I know I'm ready to I am I am ready to transition to the next plane and oh

349
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,020
I want a tinder transition and I want to be surrounded by loved ones and one cowboy

350
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:27,060
Partner I went and these are these are all the special medicines we're gonna use and it's gonna be a gentle tinder time

351
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,340
You're gonna be pushing up daisies, but it'll be pleasant passing. Don't worry. Don't worry

352
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,540
Worry, we'll lay you to rest in Boothill with all your love

353
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,220
You see the undertaker measuring them and the president's like, oh thank god

354
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:50,700
It seems kind of perplexing that more cowboy movies don't have a scene where they come like the cowboy and they're like listen

355
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,860
The there's a lot of bad dudes and they're taking over the town and they're running it and the cowboy never says like actually

356
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
Have a lot of cow related business

357
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,380
Like you're looking for like, I'm probably a murderer

358
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,300
Murderer I actually have like cow shit

359
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,900
Literally, I know I've helped you out before with like some gun-related

360
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,780
Activities and that was so cool. But if you look at all these fucking cows, they're not gonna boy themselves

361
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:25,980
I was saying I've got cow things was was there just one really cool rancher in history who inspired this whole

362
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,500
Mythos that was just like oh man bad dudes are coming to town

363
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,820
Well, you need to get up to fucking Jefferson's steers and stuff and go ask for Jefferson

364
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,860
Cuz that dude is off his fucking nut and he will absolutely kill

365
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,440
Things cow and murdering

366
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,180
He has he makes the good milk and he fucking kills lots and lots and lots of people

367
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:56,140
He is fucking wild that dude go get Jefferson. There's a reason that he works in a slaughter related industry

368
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,140
Right, it would be like if in 200 years

369
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,940
There's a movie we're like and there was only one man if people could turn to the forklift

370
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,420
Much like all forklift operators. He was a fucking crazy murderer

371
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,140
They would call him like fork boys

372
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:29,700
Yeah, he's carrying a bunch of barrels. What's he gonna do with those barrels?

373
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:37,660
Damn you lifting fork boys. He palleted us again. Damn damn put dropped a pallet on my son

374
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,780
To be fair my son was killing other folk to you

375
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,300
Motorcycles kind of a steel horse. Oh my god, just you're right. That's awesome. Fuck dude. That's cool

376
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
You say the coolest shit sometimes

377
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Okay, say something cool about

378
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,980
Like Frankie said I did it my way. Yeah

388
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,780
Maybe he's the lounge singer who just loves to murder. I don't know with it. I just got that stuck in my head

00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,620
Just here's here's a quote to give you a little bit of Kevin Basner flavor

452
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,700
Sales started going up about ten weeks into the pandemic

453
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,060
and

454
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,540
He said I think we every week we were pinching ourselves. Is this a bump?

455
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,620
Is this a head fake? Are we going to go back into the dumpster tomorrow?

456
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Oh boy

457
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Listen I'm a straight shooter folks

458
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,860
It's just a great

459
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:59,580
Because the implications there that there was a week a few weeks before that when CEO Kevin Basner is like

460
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,900
Hey guys, we're in the fucking dumpster right now. We need to get out the fuck together. Our only hope is that a pandemic hits

461
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:14,300
Hey Todd, you've been working on that pandemic virus that we're gonna spread around right? All right to boost our root beer sales

462
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,840
Because we okay they went back to one of the things they point out is that they

463
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,660
Stop making like when the yum brands own them

464
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:29,080
they were they're getting the root beer in a bag and it was coming in the bag and they put the fountain machine and

465
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,560
Now they're a hundred percent of stores are just making the root beer there

466
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:43,300
They're making it in the store and w sells root beer three to one against other soft. Fuck. Yes farm-to-market sarsaparilla

467
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Yeah, absolutely, man

468
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,040
and then

469
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,600
Just a lot of that though can be credited to when you go to an A&W and they ask you what you want to drink

470
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,440
If you say like coke they go really really do you really?

471
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
really

472
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,560
Really until you finally what they do is they say if you like coke, this is gonna drive you wild

473
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,540
This is just a quote from the article

474
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,840
This is not Kevin Basner one thing that doesn't get talked about enough

475
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,320
Especially in lockdown stretches is how drive-thru Blair's a we're open signal to guests

476
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,280
It's the herd counter to quarantine life. Whoa, is it safe to eat at a restaurant?

477
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,160
Well, ten cars were lined up outside A&W. That's a fucking wire

478
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,800
That's humanity in a nutshell, right? I guess it is one of the thing that I think they literally

479
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,000
Referred to human beings as a herd. They're lining up to the trough to eat right? Yeah, it's a fast-food website

480
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,840
What do you want certain restaurants added a second menu board to handle elevated traffic?

481
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,000
That's one way of an interesting way of helping deal with kovat. Here's another a

482
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,160
Kansas location even created quote bubbles

483
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,260
For employees to wear and guard themselves from the virus and the elements

484
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,300
They had a tablet underneath the plastic and could talk to guests and the article

485
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,200
Continues from there and does not stop and like hold on. I know you're wondering what the fuck we're even talking about

486
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,540
So let us pause for a second explain the A&W bubbles that we trapped employees in for the kovat time

487
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,700
I have never more in my life

488
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,900
Where should they had interviewed the person that they were talking about then I do right that I need this one

489
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,980
Wildcat because they didn't say what they don't say. It's not like the one cat that invented the like

490
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,940
You know

491
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,260
Filet-o-fish and then McDonald's is like good idea. We'll go we'll do that the other ones

492
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,060
This is just one wildcat that did this an A&W was like, huh? Good effort. Hey cool

493
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,980
Hey, maybe you shouldn't talk to everybody about this like super good effort

494
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,260
We really wish maybe that maybe that employee do that found she was gonna roll in that day

495
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,340
And he really wanted to knock his socks off really make a good impression

496
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,900
Here's the real story White Castle launches birthday cake on a stick, huh?

497
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:18,900
And then the last word that headline is dessert, which yeah, okay, I gathered not a savory app

498
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,380
Oh now

499
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,780
White Castle a family-owned business since 1921. Happy 100th birthday White Castle

500
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:32,420
They formally kicked off the 100th birthday on March 10th with special events and offers to continue throughout the year

501
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,140
This month the fast-food innovator unveils a few crave worthy items

502
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:44,220
Oh, yeah, Justin do you you spend a lot of time in the QSR you spend a lot of time in that realm, right?

503
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,900
Not a not a compliment

504
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,100
No, do you think that quick service restaurants have used the word crave so much that it's lost all meaning

505
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,220
Yeah, 100% crave is meaningless now. Okay in

506
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,140
1927 Billy Ingram the founder of White Castle and great-grandfather of the current generation at the helm

507
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:09,180
Invented restaurant carryout by offering a bag of sliders that could be purchased specifically to take home and

508
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,180
Before that nothing and what were bags for? No one knew. Hey, can I can I have this food?

509
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,180
But I want to eat it at home. No

510
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,660
Can I have three hamburgers you're being fucking ridiculous. Are you gonna carry one on your head?

511
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,260
Alongside that innovation came one of the industry's most recognized taglines

512
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,180
Buy them by the sack. Oh, yeah that replaced their old

513
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,840
Tagline bring a hand-darned sack from home

514
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,420
Fill it with our burger, but I pop up come get a sack

515
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,300
Today the traditions continue to White Castle restaurants where a 10 sack of sliders is available at any time

516
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,560
Morning noon or night because I guess denying people the right to do that at a White Castle would actually be insane

517
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Why would you even be open?

518
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,460
um, there's a special tin sack offer that covers cravers for the meal, but often

519
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,380
There's a special tin sack offers cover craver

520
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:29,060
For the meal. I'm gonna try to make it. Yeah, say it again. Are you missing? Stop like this is not one of my like little goof-a-boats.

521
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:36,540
The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal. Are you missing any words? Are you dropping words Justin?

522
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,260
I'm gonna slack it to you guys so you can see I'm saying it fucking verbatim.

523
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,780
The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal, but often dessert is essential particularly when celebrating something special.

524
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,940
Travis, I would have said this to you, but just put it in slack read this read the sentence. Oh God

525
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,340
Just read it. The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal

526
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,820
But often dessert is essential particularly when celebrating something special

527
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,660
Wow, so we've offered cover cravers for the meal. That's that's standard

528
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,620
Mark your calendar for April 18th

529
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,140
Just write it up there. Nothing weird about it because White Castle is gonna begin offering its new sweet edition

530
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,700
Birthday cake on a stick now that seems like a wild promotion, but it's actually just joining

531
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,840
The lineup of dessert favorites, which includes fudge dip cheesecake on a stick

532
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,340
Fudge dip brownie on a stick and gooey butter cake on a stick

533
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:39,340
The birthday cake variation features a vanilla cake base with white frost

534
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:47,780
Topped with blue white and orange sprinkles this limited time dessert offering is perfect for celebrating 100 years of cravings

535
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,220
now listen

536
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:56,820
When it's late in the night, and I've lost all sense of self-control when it comes to eating because you know

537
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,380
Life is hard sometimes

538
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,100
That sounds great. I would totally destroy three of those. Yeah, it sounds pretty good

539
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,900
Jamie Richardson's the veep over at White Castle and he says

540
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,100
Throughout this year throughout the year. We're inviting cravers to be part of the festivities

541
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,940
Oh, thank God

542
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:20,340
So pass around the birthday cake on a stick and let's celebrate the next 100 years and now that I mentioned it

543
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,180
Probably don't pass around. Don't do that. Hey, there is a global don't do that

544
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,140
Unless you've had all did you have all three vaccines then you can pass around birthday cake on a stick go nuts

545
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,460
I like what that implies because that implies that it's like a birthday party and there's cake for everybody

546
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,860
But that's like if I had a birthday party and everybody came to my party and I said, okay cool

547
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
Do you want some cake? It's $3.99 a piece

548
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,180
It does look kind of good though

549
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,820
It kind of looks like one of those little Debbie's like a little Debbie, but somebody but someone fucking stabbed it

550
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,900
It looks like a little Debbie that someone desecrated

551
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,580
Do you think hey folks when you break when you're done with your birth cake?

552
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,580
You got cake on a stick and they mentioned this specifically and it says here Kevin Richardson then added

553
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,320
Please don't bring the stick back to White Castle

554
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:09,980
we've had so many people and their hearts are in the right place asking if we wanted the sticks back for other birthday cakes and

555
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,100
We had to tell him no the stick is there's the key which they have a hard time believing because it's a pretty good stick

556
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,100
I'll think it does not say that

557
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,300
Yeah, it's all in there

558
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,580
Man, do you think if you're in the White Castle and you like take a fork and just kind of push the cake off the stick?

559
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,340
Onto a plate that one of the employees comes in is like we don't do table cake and they just take it away from

560
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,140
No table cake at the White Castle

561
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,260
Don't dirty a dish

562
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,260
Keep a stick

563
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,260
Don't dirty this make some trash I

564
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,140
Think we've only done one regular question

565
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:52,140
When I was 10 my fifth grade teacher gave us all keys as part of a class project and tasked us to find what the keys

566
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,060
Open, I was extremely stubborn

567
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,300
So I spent hours making my friends try the locks around my school

568
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,580
And when we finally gave up my teacher told us if we came back in 10 years

569
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,420
She would give us the answer. I vowed I would return

570
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,820
However, she was a terribly mean teacher and I did not want any contact with him

571
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,180
How do I find the answer to this mystery that has been in the back of my mind for 13 years while also holding a petty

572
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,700
Grudge, that's from ollie. I love to get your eyes. Yeah, I got the I have that

573
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,300
answer yeah, perfect because it was gonna be something like you show up and you're but you're old and

574
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:31,740
She's much older now and you're like, oh mrs. Hawthorne and she's so fucking I mean, it's a real

575
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:40,980
Trunchbull situation and you're like remember this you hold the key and she's like, yeah, you know, so what's that open and she's like

576
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,060
It'll be some bullshit like the doors of

577
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:53,420
Opportunity and the key is reading and behind the door is the is your future and you want to be an astronaut

578
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,300
Use this use your reading key to the opportunities future

579
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,820
now Griffin, I think that that is

580
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:09,340
Optimistic, okay that there was a lesson behind it because I am looking this right fifth grade

581
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,620
Gave a bunch of keys. Yeah said the class project is

582
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,820
Find what in the world?

583
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,160
This random key goes. Yeah, I don't think your teacher fucking knew

584
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:28,980
Yeah, no, here is the here is the story teachers hungover shows up at school. They're like teachers aid

585
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,340
mr

586
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:39,460
Peterson Lee says so what's the lesson plans today? And he's just like, oh, no

587
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,940
Okay, hold on let me look and see what I got in my wallet

588
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,620
Okay, okay, yeah, I'll come up with something out of this this the whole thing is made up

589
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,960
This is someone who is just stalling for time. Yeah, and who wanted to go back to because why why would they say ten years?

590
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,600
Years end of the year end of the year. So at the end of the year, I'll tell you right you haven't you get the

591
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,040
Day, you graduate. Yeah, even that would be another possibility. But ten years is yeah come back in ten years

592
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,160
Oh, yeah, they picked that they picked the amount of years that you definitely would not follow, right?

593
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Exactly. That's actually my answer is now I think been proven categorically wrong

594
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,360
Because you can't actually would be 13 years for this person come back and say so what's the key do and they're like

595
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:33,280
It's the key to opportunity. I mean then you're like, I'm fucking like 36 and it hasn't really happened for me yet

596
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,440
So it's not a really that it's not really that I mean readings great and all but it hasn't necessarily

597
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,720
helped me be an astronaut and

598
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,340
No one in the class where they all the same keys where they random what the fuck happened

599
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,340
I think it's just a drunk drunk drunk

600
