1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,240
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,960
A lot of people ask, Justin, why do you keep recording this show?

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,600
They say, it angers as many people as it helps. Why do you keep recording it?

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,720
And I keep recording it because every week we try to come up with

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,880
some topical thing to talk about to begin our program, and I get Travis's suggestions.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,200
Travis, you should introduce yourself.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,440
Oh, hello, I'm Travis McElroy.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,840
Uh-huh, and Griffin, you're up in this piece too, right?

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,760
I am all up in this bitch, in it to win it.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,240
In it to win it. Travis, why don't you hit everybody

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
with what your big suggestions were for this week? And I don't want any editorializing,

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,320
I just want you to list the topics that you suggested for our comedy podcast to kick off with.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay, well, the first was simply debt ceiling.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,560
Debt ceiling, yeah, who's ready to laugh?

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
Number two, Grease is going into default.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Now, if you get some like hand jive, Olivia Newton, John action in there,

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
I think you could maybe get something going.

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,480
Travis, I know what all those words, isolated, what they mean, together though,

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,520
not quite so sure what a default.

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
I thought the third one was the real gem that I really thought we could have mined

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,840
for comedy, but it was Monte Carlo is coming out starring Selena Gomez.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh, you mean The Big Race?

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah, The Big Race, that's news. If we could just talk about The Race, like the formula.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh no, it's a comedy movie for tweens.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Oh yeah, and you would say you're pretty excited.

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Well, Andy McDowell's in it.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
Oh shit, that national treasure.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
She's my number one celebrity crush.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Whichever pulse you have your finger on, can you stop touching that person,

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,840
that person that you're touching?

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,680
It's actually Selena Gomez.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
That's right, I know.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
I have a direct pipeline to Selena Gomez.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
I am extraordinarily uncomfortable with it.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,560
How about the fact that gay dudes and ladies can now get married in New York?

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
Oh fuck, that's way better.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
That's way better.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,760
Damn it.

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
Oh no, but hold on, wait.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
Because let's balance these two.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,240
Let's put these two on the scales of justice, because what's more important?

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,880
Gay marriage or Selena Gomez.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
A Selena Gomez full-length feature film.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
I really like Selena Gomez.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
I think she's a rising star.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,240
I just want to get married to Tim Gunn, and I don't think that's so wrong, is it?

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,400
I want to get married to Justin Bieber.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
You guys remember Justin's first date with Tim Gunn?

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
Yeah, they went and saw Monte Carlo with Selena Gomez.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
They necked the entire time, he really made it work.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,360
Yeah, the junior mints were mushy, but the sex was neat.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:51,120
I just imagine Tim Gunn's sex face and put me into a state.

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,440
It put me in a state that I'm not comfortable with.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Yeah, New York.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,960
New York.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,080
Because you're a bigot, and you're uncomfortable with the gay marriage.

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
It's now legal there.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,440
So this is, of course, our advice program.

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,840
We record it for you every week to help you with the little things that pop up in your life.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
We also talk to each other about the things that are going on in our lives,

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,760
because it's a helping show.

66
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Can I say something real quick about the New York past and the gay marriage?

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,680
There's nothing in this earth that would make me stop you from talking more about it.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
There were four Republican senators that voted for it, and like, yeah, gay marriage rules.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
There was one Republican who was like, listen,

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
this is a vote of conscience and not a vote of party line.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
I actually remember in my middle school social studies class,

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I learned that every vote in the Senate is a vote of conscience,

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,360
because if you're asleep, they won't let you govern.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
They won't let you act in a political body.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,760
You will allow me to pronounce that word as conscience.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
Then I will pronounce it better.

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
I won't.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
I absolutely won't.

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
You guys are breaking my heart.

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
Let's take the first question.

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
I love my girlfriend, but she keeps eating off my plate

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
when she has perfectly good food in front of her.

83
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
She'll order what she wants, and then she looks longingly at what I got

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,000
until I ask if she wants a bite.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,920
How can I put a stop to this without sounding like a selfish jerk?

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Hungry like the wolf.

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
Why are you so hungry?

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,720
Hey, dog, like, chill out.

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
You live in America.

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Like, if you don't get enough food right now at this meal,

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
literally, if you scoop your hand through the nearest gutter,

92
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
you'll come up with, like, a hot dog or something.

93
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
At least four ho-hos.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
Like, you'll be fine.

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm totally on his side.

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Of course.

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,080
Oh, come on.

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
That's his food.

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,160
It's not.

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
That's what a relationship is.

101
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,360
If a relationship is not, at the very least, about sharing your food,

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,520
like, that's, like, the most basic survival-level post-apocalyptic,

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
like, hi, I found this half-eaten Hershey bar.

104
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, I have a beef turkey.

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
Well, let's have a relationship.

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Like, this is the base relationship.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
The basest one we can have.

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,520
Well, here's, okay, I have a suggestion.

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,040
Make her order first and then order the exact same thing she gets.

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,080
Okay.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
She'll never see that coming.

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,640
Does she order a salad?

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,840
My wife does that a lot.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,760
If she orders a salad, you get a salad.

115
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
Like, this is gonna be a long game.

116
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll get something delicious because I'm overweight

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
and I know what things taste good.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
It's the one, like, perk of the gig.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
And she'll, like, say, hey, that looks good.

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,560
It's like, yeah, no shit.

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,440
I've been at this for a while.

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,320
This ain't my first time at the steak rodeo.

123
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,480
Yeah.

124
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
And also, can we stop coming to the steak rodeo?

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
It smells like old wallpaper and I hate it here.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
There's peanut shells on the floor, but they don't serve peanuts.

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,400
Where do all these peanuts come from?

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
Ma'am, excuse me, ma'am.

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,760
Can I be reseated in the non-peanut section?

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
That doesn't exist.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,040
Yeah, I mean, like, just share your food.

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
It's not a big deal.

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,800
You know what?

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
Here's what you do.

135
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
If this is really that important to you-

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
Sit at different tables.

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,680
What?

138
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,880
You, uh, when she starts eating off your plate,

139
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,680
order another one.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
I say, hold on.

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
No, we can make this work.

142
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
I'll get a second one for you.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,320
You've touched this.

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,360
I don't want it anymore.

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
So you're saying always, like, order-

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
I will have two of that, please.

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,760
I'll have two of those, please.

148
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
You know, I'll do that.

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay.

150
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,440
This is something that I've started doing.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
I order two meals when I go to a restaurant

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
with the express purpose of intending to take one home

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,280
and eat it later.

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,960
You do do that.

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
How is that weird?

156
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
Don't make that sound like a thing that you do constantly.

157
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Because you don't.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,480
No, no.

159
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,640
If you did it constantly, you would be some sort of glutton.

160
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Some sort of gluten.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,600
No, not constantly.

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,760
But like, if I go to a brunch place, I'll get two brunches.

163
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Now, sometimes the spirit will overtake me

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
and I will eat both of them in one sitting.

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,360
I will admit to the last time I went to the Chili Willys

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
and I was getting so their delicious Texas Red,

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
I did order carry out.

168
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
I got two of them with the express purpose

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
of eating one of them the next day.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Is that cool?

171
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Is it just the restaurant thing?

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,760
That's not normal, you guys.

173
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,800
Why is that not normal?

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
I think that that's planning ahead.

175
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
I think that's kind of brilliant.

176
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
Well, where does that fucking stop?

177
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,480
Can you be like, hey, let me get seven cups

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,560
of that sweet Texas Red.

179
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
Daddy's going to have a chili week.

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,480
Happy chili week, everybody.

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
You try to paint that like a bad thing.

182
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
I think that's an awesome idea.

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah, like is anyone hungry?

184
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,480
I have all the chili.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Do you want that?

186
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
I mean, I have it.

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
Watch out for that guy.

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,840
He'll come in and order just like a month worth of chili.

189
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
It's chili Steve.

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,560
When you come here sometimes and you're like,

191
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,840
Griffin, I don't know where the money,

192
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
like, I don't know where my money is.

193
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Like my money.

194
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Where did all the money go, Griffin?

195
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
And I'll say, Travis, it's, do you remember

196
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,760
how you ate 14 steaks from Outback Steakhouse last week?

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
You got one in the restaurant and you said,

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
let me get a baker's dozen of steak to go.

199
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
That's where it all went.

200
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,760
To be fair, I said a staker's dozen.

201
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,240
I was wondering if you could help me out with a friend of mine.

202
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
I like this guy a lot, but he has to make it known

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
that he's a vegetarian.

204
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,520
He usually doesn't mention it around close friends.

205
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,840
However, I've been noticing whenever he's communicating

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,320
to new people, one of the first things that he asks,

207
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
it says is that he's a vegetarian.

208
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
I want to tell him he's being a snob,

209
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
but that nobody cares what he puts in his mouth.

210
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
Only what comes out.

211
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,320
Like puke?

212
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
Yeah, whenever I even bring it up,

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,840
he lashes out at me and thinks I'm attacking him.

214
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Is he really being a snob or am I just overthinking it?

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Help me, brothers.

216
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,280
And that's from Mr. Bixby.

217
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,440
I think it depends on how he's saying it.

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Oh, me?

219
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Me?

220
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
My eating preferences?

221
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm a vegetarian.

222
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Sit down.

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,640
Let me tell you about it.

224
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
No steak for me, thanks.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,880
We're at a carwash.

226
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
Like, why would that even be in the equation?

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,280
Why would that even be in the equation?

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,200
I hope that's free range prawn.

229
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,720
What?

230
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
He's probably not being a snob.

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
I don't know that people can be a snob.

232
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
I mean, they definitely can be.

233
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
You can be a snob about anything.

234
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,320
But I mean, that's such a big part of a person's life.

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,680
If they're a vegetarian or vegan or only eats translucent foods.

236
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,960
Yeah, but at the same time-

237
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,280
I only eat dark fruits.

238
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,680
Like, I think that's such a big part of their life that like, yeah,

239
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
they're going to talk about it.

240
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
But I don't introduce myself as Travis McElroy Omnivore.

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
No, but because that's the norm.

242
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
It does say on your business cards, though.

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,760
Well, yes.

244
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
Let's not play make-believe here.

245
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
You are not an omnivore, sir.

246
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
I eat everything.

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I don't think omnivore is the correct name for that.

248
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,120
Can we say a part-time herbivore, maybe?

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Like a practicing carnivore.

250
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
I dabble.

251
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,280
I dabble in vegetables.

252
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,440
You like to check in every once in a while, see what's new on the scene,

253
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,400
but you're not like blogging about them.

254
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
Yeah, I'm not like super committed.

255
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm like a Christmas and Easter herbivore.

256
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Right, I can dig it.

257
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
But that's the norm, right?

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,400
Like everybody eats everything, right?

259
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Except for those three or four people who don't.

260
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
So those three or four people get to bring it up, is what you're saying?

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
They have denied themselves life's greatest pleasure, which is to say bacon.

262
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
They can do whatever they want.

263
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
They've earned it.

264
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,920
Yeah, but who gives a shit?

265
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,640
I don't care.

266
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,400
Maybe it's part of their identity.

267
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,960
But it's not something that should determine whether or not you want to hang out with a person.

268
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
So if you're meeting someone for the first time and they're like,

269
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,640
oh, and by the way, I'm a vegetarian, you're like, fuck it, I'm out.

270
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,480
It does if you're ahead of lettuce.

271
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah.

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
Who can relax then?

273
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,760
What's up?

274
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,960
Cucumber fingers?

275
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,920
Oops, they're gone.

276
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,360
Shoot off.

277
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

278
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,080
An important question, too, is how long has he been a vegetarian?

279
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,680
Because if it's like within the last three months, he's totally being a snob.

280
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,520
Maybe he's just telling everybody he's a vegetarian

281
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
so he has some excuse for when he faints later.

282
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I'm sorry I don't get enough vegetables.

283
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,160
Or so people like try to encourage him to eat bacon and then he's like, what?

284
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
No, okay.

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
Jerry, why is your blood so light?

286
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,680
It's like your blood isn't even there.

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,240
I mean, I think it matters.

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,280
I think it's a big part of a person because what if you start crushing on a vegetarian

289
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,800
and you don't know they're a vegetarian, though, and you ask them to go to Sizzler?

290
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Love ruined.

291
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
Relationship gone.

292
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
I think if your first date's to the Sizzler, that ship's sailed.

293
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,480
That ship's already-

294
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
That's a good restaurant.

295
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,600
I haven't been recently.

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
Have they revamped the menu?

297
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,280
No, it's still pretty much the same.

298
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,000
It's still pretty much like steaks and you can get the steaks cooked however you want them.

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,720
Oh, man.

300
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
However you want them?

301
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Sometimes there's potatoes, but there's like a secret language.

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,840
It's kind of like ordering it in and out.

303
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,920
You got to say, can I get a steakham and tubes and they know that when you say tubes-

304
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
Is that really how it is?

305
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,640
You say steakham and tubes and when you say tubes, they know that you mean tube.

306
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I need a steakham and tubes.

307
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,240
I need it slarshed and dumps.

308
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,240
They look at you.

309
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
They say, that is not real steak.

310
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
With a Pepsi.

311
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
I need a steakham and tubes.

312
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
I need it slarshed and dumps.

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
Can I get two Megatators and-

314
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,560
To be fair, that was my favorite sci-fi channel movie.

315
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
I'd like two Megatators fully cheesed out.

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,200
Just sizzle the whole plate if you can.

317
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,680
Sour creamo.

318
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,640
That's not a good password though.

319
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
Yes, you're right.

320
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,280
Not sour cream.

321
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,960
Like fresh cream.

322
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,240
That worked because that's sort of like reverse psychology.

323
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,520
You guys want a yahoo?

324
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes, please.

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
You know I do.

326
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,800
How about this one?

327
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
It was sent in by Gabe Gysin.

328
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,800
Thank you, Gabe.

329
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,080
It's by yahoo answers user Pat who asks,

330
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,960
Is the matrix real and is it possible?

331
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,800
Simple question, argued answer.

332
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,560
What?

333
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,240
Is the matrix real and are we biological batteries?

334
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,560
And is the human body capable of producing enough energy to power an entire world of machines

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
if there were six billion of us?

336
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
And if so, how would we get out?

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Self-substantion?

338
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Suicide.

339
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Or is there someone who could free us?

340
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,240
Red pill.

341
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Please take this question seriously.

342
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
No sarcasm or blatant humor.

343
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,560
Thank you.

344
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Boy, when you have to say that right in the question, you were just begging for it.

345
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
No blatant humor.

346
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
I don't care if you like-

347
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,640
I'm like supes dumb.

348
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
So if you want to say shit that's like,

349
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm not going to understand.

350
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,320
You're making fun of me.

351
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,480
That's supposed to-

352
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,400
I want to fucking punch this dude mostly because of this-

353
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,520
the phrase, simple question, argued answer.

354
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,480
Here's the problem, Travis.

355
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,760
You try to punch this guy and he dodges it in slow motion

356
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
and turns into like three or four different guys.

357
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,120
I want to meet the people that are arguing about this.

358
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh, you know they exist, right?

359
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,560
Oh, of course.

360
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, because you can't-

361
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,800
It's one of those you can't prove it.

362
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,160
You can't-

363
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,880
You can't pro-

364
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
Like anything you could create, you know, to-

365
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,560
to refute it could just be another creation of the matrix.

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
You're just another agent, man.

367
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,720
Yeah.

368
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,520
Like, we've all thought about it, right?

369
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,200
Like we've all just sat down-

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,400
We had that moment when we were on a bunch of drugs.

371
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,720
In that deep dark truthful mirror and saw that in that mirror

372
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
we were covered in metallic juices

373
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
and then we were transported to the real world.

374
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah, you know what though, Griffin,

375
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,800
I think we've all had that thought, but you know what?

376
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,040
I had it back in 19 fucking 99 when the movie was released.

377
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,760
I'm not still kicking that around in 2011

378
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
and thinking like, oh, maybe.

379
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,200
Like, it's been 12 years.

380
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
Maybe not.

381
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Like, probably that is not the-

382
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,960
that is one construction that you could believe in,

383
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,120
but I am not subscribing to it.

384
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,200
I mean, look, some people go their whole lives without waking up, you know?

385
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Uh-huh, yeah.

386
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,960
Come on, copper talk.

387
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Some people go their whole-

388
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,080
I mean, that's all there is.

389
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,280
It's like, what if we are flesh batteries?

390
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,120
Like, there's only 10 of us who've made it out to the hallowed halls of Zion.

391
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,600
Like, what?

392
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,280
In the rave, in the origin-

393
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,840
In the rave underground fucking rubbing my dirty, dirty body on everyone.

394
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,000
Like-

395
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Lawrence Fishburne spray oil on the crowd.

396
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
I know 10 person rave is a really shitty rave.

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,800
TJ Fishburne, he's on the ones and twos and he's getting wet in Zion

398
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,680
and like, you're in here, you're on earth,

399
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
and you're laughing at somebody on Yahoo Answers.

400
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,400
How's your life?

401
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
What gives you the right?

402
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,120
You could be-

403
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,640
You could be bumping to the sounds of DJ Fishburne,

404
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,120
letting his smooth grooves propel you to a higher plane of funky existence.

405
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,000
And here you are.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
DJ Cowboy Curtis is mixing up the Chemical Brothers for everybody.

407
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
Only Cowboy and Curtis with K's.

408
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
Mm-hmm.

409
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,800
He's a real talent.

410
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,840
He could give another DJ, insert another DJ name here, a run for his money.

411
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Tiesto?

412
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,760
He could give Tiesto?

413
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,240
Tiesto is an agent.

414
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
Tiesto is an agent.

415
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
So he does not count.

416
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
That would explain so many things.

417
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,800
Like, you've never listened to speed rail and been like,

418
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,400
oh, these beats are impossible.

419
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
Nobody can make these beats unless they're computer programmed.

420
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,160
Do you think that this guy, like, this is the question that starts every conversation

421
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
he has with new people?

422
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
Like, hi, nice to meet you.

423
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Oh, you're a vegetarian.

424
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
That's great.

425
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
Do you think that the matrix is real?

426
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
Are you really a vegetarian?

427
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,520
Or is that a choice that our computer overlords decided for you?

428
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Do they switch a bit of code in there?

429
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,800
They switch you to a vegetarian because they knew I would be more sexually attracted to you.

430
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,080
Thanks, overlords.

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Do you guys ever see, like, déjà vu?

432
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,960
And you're like, maybe.

433
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,240
Maybe.

434
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,720
I don't know.

435
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
I can't explain it.

436
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,760
You know who can?

437
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,320
Fishburne.

438
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Here's what I know, that if Fishburne's gonna come for somebody,

439
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
he's gonna come for somebody with an open mind.

440
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
I want that to be me.

441
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
If we are in the matrix, which I have, over the span of this conversation,

442
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,680
convinced myself that we are, in fact, in the matrix.

443
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
Because you can't prove we aren't.

444
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,240
Can't prove we aren't.

445
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,560
It's kind of like religion.

446
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,200
Uh, if you doubt it, that's just the devil.

447
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,240
In our case, uh, it's Joe Paglioni trying to convince you.

448
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
Joey Pants.

449
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
Joey Pants, as I call- as I and other members of the Italian community call him Joey Pants,

450
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,840
trying to convince you otherwise.

451
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
He's the devil.

452
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
He'd be a good devil.

453
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,480
Yeah, he would.

454
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,360
Let's make that happen.

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
You know who we- can we-

456
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,160
You're welcome, Hollywood.

457
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Can we call up the Wachowski brothers and be like,

458
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
like, hey guys, like, isn't-

459
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,800
Quit keeping us in suspense.

460
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,880
Like, is this a documentary or not?

461
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,560
Was this shot on location?

462
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,320
Or is it a location in your own imaginations?

463
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
Your infernal minds.

464
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,920
Does- does anyone have a beat on Keanu?

465
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Does anyone have his- his- his manager's, uh, info to get us around?

466
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,480
If you've got his AOL screen name, can you just, like, forward that to me at our Bim Bam account?

467
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,040
Um, we'll just get up with him-

468
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,120
because I think he would know what he'd tell us, though.

469
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,400
I think we would say, hey Keanu, um, I tried to shorten his name.

470
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
Which is his Hawaiian name.

471
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,520
Hey, um, hey Keanu, uh, what- what do you know?

472
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Why don't you tell us?

473
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,680
And he's gonna look at us with kind of a knowing smile and be like,

474
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,880
sorry guys, like, uh, can't- can't say or else I'll get unplugged and then he'll wink at us.

475
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,800
And then we'll say Keanu no really fucking,

476
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,880
like, I gotta know, it keeps me up at night.

477
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,280
And he'll say, yes, it's real.

478
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
And then, like, he'll stand up really rigidly and he'll be like, not like this.

479
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,760
And he'll fall every day.

480
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
Hey, Wachowski brothers, I just wrote Matrix 4 for you, you ungrateful fucks.

481
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
Did you read TMZ today?

482
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
It was really- there's a crazy story about Keanu dying.

483
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,160
Apparently Griffin killed him by making him admit the Matrix is real.

484
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
We got him plugged.

485
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,120
It was brutal.

486
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
It was really brutal, but now we all know.

487
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
So we're going to start the rebellion.

488
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Sacrificial lamb.

489
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
I just want to party in Zion.

490
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
Griffin wouldn't even do anything with the information.

491
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,480
He'd just be like, uh, uh, and then go to Chipotle.

492
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,160
He doesn't give a shit.

493
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,880
This burrito tastes so much better now that Keanu's dead.

494
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
I feel so much more alive because I outlived Keanu.

495
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,720
I don't care if I am a battery.

496
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
This burrito is delish.

497
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,280
Delicious.

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
I don't need to know that the computer program tells me it's delicious.

499
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm just happy to have that in my heart somewhere.

500
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
There are some extra ones and zeros in this burrito.

501
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,160
Is that picante?

502
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Can I have some extra data, please, on my, on my, uh, burrito?

503
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
Let me get like 400 megabits of Chipotle's salsa sauce.

504
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
There's only four megabytes left.

505
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,200
You better take them.

506
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,040
Om nom nom nom nom.

507
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,960
Hey brothers, recently a girl I knew back in middle school asked me on Facebook and

508
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
invited me to her small birthday gathering she's having this weekend in which there'll

509
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,920
be a bunch of people.

510
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,200
I haven't seen since we were kids and probably are more accomplished with their lives than

511
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
me.

512
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,200
Should I make up some awesome backstory of what I've been doing all these years?

513
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,720
Neal.

514
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
That's how I imagine he says his name.

515
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,400
Neal.

516
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,440
Neal.

517
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
Neal.

518
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Just, just be Neal.

519
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,080
Be the best Neal you can be.

520
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,360
What if you, what if you show up to the party and people say, what do you do now?

521
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
You say, I'm Neal.

522
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,680
Like, they should get like, hi, look at me.

523
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,920
It's me, Neal.

524
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm Neal, you know, from-

525
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
Of Neal fame.

526
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,880
My job is to be Neal and I'm always employee of the month.

527
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,120
Yeah.

528
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,800
It doesn't pay, it pays terribly.

529
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,440
The pay is gone, benefits are non-existent.

530
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,280
Uh, there is not a lot of, not a lot of responsibility, not a lot of upward mobility either.

531
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Once you're Neal, you're pretty much just Neal.

532
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,920
For life.

533
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,480
But also, the chances of getting fired are pretty slim.

534
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,920
Did you hear the news?

535
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,200
Caught laid off.

536
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
Caught laid off from Neal this week.

537
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,680
Guess it's back to Kevin.

538
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
They caught me stealing.

539
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,200
A shop lesson from Neal.

540
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
Caught me stealing from Neal.

541
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,920
It's a sexual abuse scandal.

542
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,960
My mom caught me in my bedroom watching Baywatch.

543
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
It's pretty messed up.

544
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Ah, Neal, listen man.

545
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,760
You, you don't know those motherfuckers anything.

546
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
120 years from now, we're all worm food.

547
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,320
Fuck it.

548
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,440
They're no better than you are.

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
120?

550
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,800
That's your estimate?

551
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, I don't know who's gonna be at this party.

552
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
There might be some cyborgs there.

553
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
Who, of course, their machinations cannot exist for long.

554
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,600
Well, you're assuming that Neal is zero years old.

555
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,920
Actually, you're assuming he's like negative 30 years old.

556
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah.

557
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,120
Listen, I don't want to bum Neal out by giving him like-

558
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,040
I could tell Neal exactly when he's gonna die.

559
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,880
I don't think he wants to hear that I'm a bim bam.

560
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,360
That's true.

561
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,200
Yeah, but don't, don't lie because that's a-

562
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,920
There's no way that's not going to turn into a fiasco.

563
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah.

564
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
No, I think the better option is to honestly tell them

565
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
what you are honestly doing in your life,

566
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,360
but with such conviction and dedication

567
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
that makes it sound like you're super proud of it.

568
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
It's all about the perception.

569
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
I wish he told us what it is he's doing because I can spin anything.

570
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,040
Well, if he- okay, so say he's living in his mom's basement.

571
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
I'm saving up for a house.

572
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay, great.

573
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
He's working at Arby's.

574
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,920
What?

575
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Working at Arby's and working on an expose about the fast food industry?

576
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I'm a beef specialist.

577
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
That one I think would get him less traction.

578
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm an artisanal beef shaver.

579
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
No matter what job you're doing right now,

580
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,040
you can always spin it as research for a role.

581
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,760
Yeah.

582
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm researching for a role at Arby's employee.

583
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm in the new Michael Cera picture and I'm an Arby's employee,

584
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,520
so I'm hoping to get the part in the new Michael Cera.

585
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm hoping Michael Cera makes a movie about Arby's employees.

586
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
It's called Squash the Beef and it's coming out in the summer of 2012.

587
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
It co-stars Megan Fox.

588
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,680
What a talented young lady.

589
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,040
Danny Trejo is in it.

590
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,720
He's a, he's a rugged gentleman.

591
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
He's all heart though.

592
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,040
Scraggy and leathery on the outside, but inside he's like gooey center.

593
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,320
That's a hard casing for a sensitive heart.

594
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,800
Exactly.

595
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I think be you because otherwise you are going to get caught

596
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,960
because you are going to be like,

597
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,640
oh, I run a gym and someone else can be like,

598
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,520
I also run a gym.

599
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,480
What's your gym called?

600
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
And you're fucked.

601
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,040
And you'd be like, oh, I meant J-I, I meant J-I-M.

602
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,400
I run, I run a man named Jim is my job.

603
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm Jim.

604
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm in charge of him.

605
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,880
My name is Jim.

606
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,840
Let's be honest, Neal.

607
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
If you're really sharp at thinking on your feet,

608
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,200
you would probably be in a better position than you are right now.

609
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,440
Today is not the day to try and reinvent yourself as upwardly mobile dude.

610
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
Let's back up though because something even weirder

611
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,160
than your job status is happening.

612
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,640
And that is that a girl you knew back in middle school

613
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
added you on Facebook and invited you to her birthday party.

614
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Like, hey, Neal, this is Susan.

615
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Remember me?

616
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,400
You absolutely can't.

617
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
Like, there's no way.

618
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
But do you want to come chill at my birthday party?

619
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,800
I think it's a small gathering.

620
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,640
It's only like eight people and you.

621
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:14,880
Yeah.

622
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
Oh, shit.

623
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
Neal, you're about to get carried.

624
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh, God.

625
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Neal, Neal, get out of there.

626
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,560
Neal, come back.

627
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,880
You're walking into a carry situation.

628
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
You got to get out.

629
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,320
Is he about to get carried or is he about to get poked?

630
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm saying someone found him on Facebook.

631
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,040
They were hunting.

632
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,440
They were trawling for Poon.

633
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,480
Hungry for Neal.

634
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,280
For man Poon.

635
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,040
So you think that this is like a small birthday party slash eyes wide shut kind of deal?

636
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Oh, this has to be a sex party.

637
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
Okay.

638
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Gots to be.

639
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,800
No way it's not.

640
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,320
It's not?

641
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
And there's no way it's not.

642
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,880
I'm saying it's 100%.

643
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,440
Oh, you're saying there's no way this isn't a sex party.

644
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
In fact, Neal, just roll up assuming it is, no matter what anyone says, because they might

645
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,440
be like putting on pretenses at first.

646
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,240
Yeah.

647
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,800
Just roll up and be like, so are we starting this sex party or what?

648
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Yeah, if you're jobless or if you work at Arby's, which is pretty much the same thing.

649
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
Sorry, Arby's employees.

650
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,840
You got to assert yourself as king of this sex.

651
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,480
I am.

652
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm a king of this sex party.

653
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,360
And the way you do that is on the porch, you bring the doorbell to enter into the house

654
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
for the parties being held.

655
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,160
You go ahead and get your dick out.

656
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,600
And you go ahead and go, I'm a king of this sex party.

657
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,360
So when they open the door, everyone knows what is up.

658
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,920
Who is this?

659
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
I think.

660
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Is that Neal?

661
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,800
I remember him from middle school.

662
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,720
I don't remember him being quite so aggressive.

663
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
I think rolling up with your dick out is good.

664
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,240
It's predictable, though.

665
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I'd put, I'd just scoot your balls through the hole of your Levi's.

666
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,160
Just scoot those out.

667
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,800
Don't like, now you can turn this into sort of a hilarious something about Mary situation

668
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
and try to dip your balls into it.

669
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
But that's not how you become king of the sex party.

670
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,920
That's how you go to the emergency room.

671
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
You don't want to do that.

672
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
What about mangina and cape?

673
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,380
Hold on.

674
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,500
What?

675
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,620
What?

676
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,480
Yeah, if he does mangina and wears the cape.

677
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,120
That's how you don't do, how does, how is that an active verb, sir?

678
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,760
You do a mangina.

679
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
That's how you become king of prison.

680
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
Can I ask you guys something?

681
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,600
This is a different approach to this.

682
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,800
Could all of his problems be corrected if he introduced himself at the party as electric

683
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,300
Neal?

684
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,200
Would that be, could that like fix pretty much everything?

685
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
He would have to have some sort of touchdown dance that he could do.

686
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,120
Oh, and the best part about that is after a couple of years and he's gone through some

687
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,200
shit and he's reevaluating his life, he can come back and tell him he's now acoustic Neal.

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,040
I'm 28.

689
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,400
He's 36 and we've been living together for seven months.

690
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,120
That's a good lead.

691
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,660
Yeah.

692
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,680
I like this.

693
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,280
This is right into the meat of the question.

694
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,200
I can, I can piece the other stuff together.

695
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,000
I chose choose to sleep naked because I don't like the restrictive feeling of clothes while

696
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,720
I sleep.

697
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,080
He chooses to sleep in shorts and t-shirts.

698
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,560
I disrobe right before crawling into bed at night and then walk directly into the bathroom

699
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
in the morning.

700
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,640
The problem is I think he is too used to seeing me naked.

701
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
Our sex life has slightly declined.

702
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,880
Seducing him doesn't work like I used to.

703
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
And I get the overall feeling that he's less excited to see my body.

704
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,280
I wonder if sleeping naked has affected this.

705
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,640
If this is true and I have exposed myself too much, is there anything I can do or is

706
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
it all downhill from here?

707
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,480
Bear or not to bear?

708
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,720
To bear or not to bear?

709
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Well, great.

710
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
Now I have to do the show with a boner.

711
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
No, I don't.

712
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
I'm just kidding.

713
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
I don't really have a boner.

714
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,040
I'm only thinking all the blood is in my comedy gland.

715
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,560
I can't think about sex right now.

716
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,840
It's in your advice lobe.

717
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
It's in my hypololimus.

718
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
It's in my Lisa lobe.

719
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I sent Lisa Loeb a package of my blood.

720
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,920
I think there's a picture of a cardboard box leaking.

721
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,400
What is this?

722
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,440
Hey, Lisa.

723
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,080
Hey, Lisa.

724
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,120
Hey, someone just dropped a package for you while you were gone.

725
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,360
It's leaking blood.

726
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,280
What appears to be blood.

727
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
Is it from Griffin McElroy?

728
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
Yeah, it is.

729
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, it smells like CK1.

730
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,520
What an odd package this is.

731
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,720
I think that yeah, you are right.

732
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,400
But the good thing about it is I think that yeah, that a guy can get conditioned to seeing

733
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,240
anybody naked.

734
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:10,080
I think that the good news is men are fundamentally machines basically, and you can roll this

735
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,200
back up really quick.

736
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,920
Oh my God.

737
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,920
If you, tonight, if you put his shirt on when you go to bed tonight and get in bed with

738
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
him, he'll be like, where did they go?

739
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,040
Where did it happen?

740
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,560
Tracey, wake up.

741
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,920
They're gone.

742
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,240
And he'll wake up the next morning like, I thought it was a dream.

743
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,640
I'm living a nightmare, Tracey.

744
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Yeah, it's literally like a day and you're back.

745
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,520
And never underestimate the power of lingerie because if he's gotten conditioned to seeing

746
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
you, Travis.

747
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,280
What?

748
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,480
No, I'm saying, I'm saying if he's gotten conditioned and used to seeing her naked.

749
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,920
You're taking this to a much, this is far too, too personal.

750
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,720
This place you're at.

751
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,360
Cover your boobies in silk and lace.

752
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Like, no, gross.

753
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,080
Fringe him out a little.

754
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,800
Wrap your, wrap your butt in candy and stuff.

755
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,040
This isn't pimp my girlfriend who I'm tired of seeing naked.

756
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,120
This is my brother, my brother made advice and not creepiness.

757
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
Although some creepiness.

758
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Cheap and practical solutions.

759
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,560
And the best that means put on a big T-shirt.

760
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Put on a big T-shirt, you goof.

761
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah, literally.

762
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
I mean, it's like Griffin's right.

763
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,120
Like overnight.

764
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,040
I mean, it'll, it might take, if you've been sleeping naked for a long time, take a week

765
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,400
to course correct yourself.

766
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,320
Don't let him see naked at all.

767
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,280
Ever again.

768
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
Ever, ever again.

769
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,040
This is evil.

770
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,440
No, like keep it, keep it under wraps for a while and maybe, oh, this is good.

771
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,680
Do something different up in there.

772
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,560
Like lingerie.

773
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:51,040
No, I mean like something underneath your, like maybe get something pierced, get some

774
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,160
ink or maybe don't do anything to say you did something and say, you wouldn't believe

775
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,120
what's under here now.

776
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
Like he would just freak out if you could see it, but you can't see it.

777
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Dave Coulier right on my gut.

778
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,720
It's so weird in here and you can't see it anymore.

779
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
And it's so weird if you need to see it.

780
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,320
Cause then he'll be crazy.

781
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,800
Like if you start teasing, now you got to deliver, you know, it can't be like Al Capone's

782
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,560
vault where Geraldo just teases and teases and teases, there's nothing in it.

783
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,920
You got to have some, you got to deliver something even if it's like a henna tattoo.

784
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,120
Or Dave Coulier.

785
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,760
Al Capone.

786
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,240
Or Al Capone.

787
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,200
Can you get Al Capone like on your torso somewhere?

788
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,600
In it on it somewhere around.

789
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,520
A tattoo or like the real Al Capone?

790
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,720
Yeah.

791
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,440
Like him.

792
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,000
Like the man.

793
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,840
Also start referring to your lady business as Al Capone's vault.

794
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Just see how that takes out.

795
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,560
Uh, side note, uh, talking to a dear friend of mine today, his father's a teacher and

796
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,520
one of the students in his class is named D'Al Capone Jones.

797
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
This is not a joke.

798
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
It's awesome.

799
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,280
This is not a gag I made up.

800
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,000
Fuck that's good.

801
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
D'Al Capone Jones.

802
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,560
Speaking of Al Capone.

803
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,280
You want a yahoo?

804
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,520
Yeah, I do.

805
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,360
This one was sent in by Chuck Jones.

806
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,400
Thanks Chuck Jones.

807
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,240
It's by yahoo answers user Patrick.

808
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,120
That's weird.

809
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,680
Two Pat's.

810
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,760
Um, Patrick asks.

811
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Questions for my dental hygienist.

812
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,680
I am going to be getting my teeth cleaned soon by my ridiculously hot dental hygienist.

813
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,040
And I want to ask some things.

814
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,200
Um, if you were asked these questions, what would your answer be?

815
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,720
And how do you think she will react?

816
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:30,880
One.

817
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,840
You want to just ask out to do we want to role play here?

818
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
Um, sure, sure.

819
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,360
Yeah, you guys can take turns being the super just banging dental hygienist.

820
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
And I'll be the sounds like me.

821
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,080
I'll be Patrick.

822
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,560
Uh, one.

823
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,880
Can I have the pair of gloves and the mask you used on me?

824
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,440
I was going to do a bit, but I think she would probably just leave the room.

825
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,720
Yeah, that was my reaction.

826
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,640
I was buying into the character saying yes to the moment.

827
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,560
And that is what my character would have done.

828
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,640
Does the general, does the dental hygienist have a button underneath the counter that

829
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
like summons the police?

830
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,120
That's what I would be doing.

831
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
Yeah, she does.

832
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,160
Now she will after this.

833
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Um, two, can I have a pair of new gloves and what kind of gloves are they?

834
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,360
That one's kind of harmless.

835
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
Uh, yeah, unless unless you couple it with the first question.

836
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah.

837
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
And then you say I just need to hide my fingerprints.

838
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,320
I can't tell you why.

839
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,360
No, it's it's it's fine.

840
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,480
Three, would you please check in the back to see if you have any pink gloves or mask

841
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,040
you could use?

842
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
What's this guy's hang up?

843
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,480
Oh, four, four.

844
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,120
Do you have to wear a mask?

845
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,680
What?

846
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,720
Can you just spit in my mouth while you're cleaning it?

847
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,280
Five, will you surprise me with the profy paste flavor?

848
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
I don't know what that means.

849
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,840
What?

850
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,120
Profy, profy.

851
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,800
This guy doesn't have a crush on his dental hygienist.

852
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
He has a dentistry fetish.

853
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
That's what's going on here.

854
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,000
And not only that, but like these aren't even like, these are the least direct yet still

855
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,600
creepy questions I've ever had.

856
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Really, Travis, because number six, instead of using a mirror to hold back my cheek, will

857
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,640
you use your finger?

858
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,120
Yes.

859
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,280
Seven, will you perform an extra intra oral and TMJ exam?

860
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,800
Really get in there.

861
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Just get deep in there.

862
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,560
Is there?

863
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,960
Is there?

864
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
OK, are there more questions?

865
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
Will you use a toothbrush instead of the polisher?

866
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
That's not particularly sexual.

867
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,520
Nine, can I add you on Facebook?

868
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,120
Oh, there it is.

869
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,560
Dr. Woodruff, can I add you on Facebook?

870
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,040
That's the end of it right there.

871
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,160
Can I Facebook you?

872
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,200
OK, here's what I would like to pause it.

873
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,760
I think there is an order in which you can ask these questions where you could get to

874
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,320
the end of them without the person leaving the room.

875
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,880
Is there an order in which you could drop these beats?

876
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,680
You got to leave.

877
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
You got to lead with Facebook, I think.

878
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
It's like making a mixtape, right?

879
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,120
Like you got to, you got to peek it back off, peek it back off.

880
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,600
Like, I think you need to mix up the really weird one.

881
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,240
Dude, I don't know.

882
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,600
I think once you hit, just use your finger.

883
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,600
Get in there with your digits.

884
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
You could play that off there.

885
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,680
Like, I have a mirror allergy.

886
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,120
I have an allergy to silver.

887
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,040
Reflective surfaces, ew.

888
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
Just get in there with your dig.

889
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,480
Hey, hey, when vampires go to the dentist, how do the doctors see their back teeth?

890
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
Oh, it's so hard.

891
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,800
That's a good question.

892
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,400
And, and I mean, dental care is so important to a vampire for obvious reasons.

893
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,120
They've got those teeth forever.

894
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,600
Especially with the sugar filled diet of the American public.

895
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,240
I mean, you can't, yeah, you can't eat a fat person without getting a calorie or a cavity.

896
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:56,160
How do you get a modicum of a boner when you're in a dentist chair?

897
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,840
How do you get, how do you focus on anything but the raw primal fear of somebody getting

898
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,960
in your teeth and just clanging around in there with their digits?

899
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,960
Like some sort of, like some sort of bad mechanic.

900
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,000
Just tune me up.

901
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040
Turn up your grill.

902
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,880
I don't think, like, I don't think I will ever be too old to not be scared fuckless

903
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,840
of the dentist.

904
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
Like, can't handle it.

905
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
Well, that is, that's because it's the most terrifying thing.

906
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
It's like the most terrifying thing.

907
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,240
I don't like, I don't like eating food.

908
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,680
Someone is putting whirring, like, blades and points into your mouth and you can't see

909
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,640
what they're doing in there.

910
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,960
You are fighting instinct at every turn.

911
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,760
Maybe that's sexual for some people.

912
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,560
Like, trying to clang, clamp down on, like, their better impulses.

913
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
All it takes is one Dr. Butterfingers and he's got a drill through your tongue.

914
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah.

915
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,600
Why?

916
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,840
Yeah, but like, that's hot for some people.

917
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,800
They love the danger.

918
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
They love the excitement.

919
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,000
The thrill, I guess?

920
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
What's gonna happen today at the dentist?

921
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,600
I don't know.

922
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,280
I might die.

923
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
I might die.

924
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
I might die.

925
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
I will get a boner.

926
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,600
That's for sure.

927
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,960
I will get arrested because I am gonna go full on creepster on my-

928
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,080
Okay, here's the thing that's gonna, like, really fuck you guys up.

929
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,400
Okay.

930
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,240
They ask these questions on Yahoo Answers.

931
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,240
There is 100% likelihood that this person who asked these things did sit in a dentist

932
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,040
chair at some point after this and have an interaction.

933
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,480
Like, this happened.

934
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,800
Like, this isn't, like, fun theory.

935
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,160
Like, this fucking creeper.

936
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,440
Oh, so he was, like, planning.

937
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,600
He did this.

938
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,440
I mean, he did these things that he's saying to us.

939
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,920
He may be apologizing.

940
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,440
Like, is this-

941
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,240
I mean, what would you do?

942
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,120
I just did this.

943
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,840
Is that cool?

944
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,800
So weird.

945
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
Did you pull this off of Craigslist Missed Connections?

946
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,440
No.

947
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,480
Me, in the dentist chair, mouth open, slightly numb.

948
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,720
You, finger, chewing on it.

949
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
Chesty, put your finger right in there.

950
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Touch my teeth.

951
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
Saw down your blouse.

952
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,680
Saw your plates out.

953
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,360
Put that mirror away, silly.

954
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,160
Get your fingers in there.

955
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
Hey, we don't need to get mirrors in there.

956
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,640
Just put your fingers in there.

957
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,560
Let me kiss your eyelids.

958
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,000
In case anybody out there is wondering, of all the times to try to, like, be flirty and

959
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,680
pick someone up, when they're in there digging out your old-ass food and tartar buildup with

960
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,480
their fingers in your gross-ass mouth as you're drooling all over yourself, probably not the

961
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:24,560
best thing.

962
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,080
Is this a piece of Mars bar?

963
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,680
Point of order, if you're trying to fuck your dental hygienist, I bet you keep it pretty

964
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
locked down up there.

965
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,560
I bet you keep-

966
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,440
Or, I bet you're pretty much on point in your mouth area.

967
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,040
That's your showpiece.

968
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,440
I just can't, like-

969
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,840
The only thing that gives me a boner about going to the dentist is, at the end of it,

970
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,200
I get a free toothbrush.

971
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
And a prize.

972
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Like, the value of that is, like, oh, I don't take the prize anymore.

973
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,840
I love-

974
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,240
What?

975
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,640
I mean, I love sticky hands, but it's a conflict of interest because I'm trying to fuck my

976
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,600
dental hygienist and, like, if I-

977
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,880
Can I get your number and also that pair of googly eyeglasses?

978
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,320
Like, we settle the bill and I walk out and I turn back and come through the door.

979
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm like, two things.

980
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,840
One, can I not get a date?

981
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,400
Two, what about those sticky hands?

982
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,200
What's up with those?

983
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,640
Because I need one to grab things that are far away.

984
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,920
But seriously though, date?

985
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,960
You want to go to Sizzler?

986
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,440
I love you.

987
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,160
One thing is, do you want to go to Sizzler?

988
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,040
The other is, do you have one of those foam planes that I build myself?

989
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,960
I love those so much.

990
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,160
I love those so much.

991
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,640
I will take one or the other.

992
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,520
Choice is yours.

993
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,200
There's only one thing that I get aroused by, and that's trips to the money zone.

994
00:41:43,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Okay, who's taking us this week, Griffin?

995
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,040
Okay, hold up.

996
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,600
Time out.

997
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,440
Why am I never invited to the money zone?

998
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Okay, Travis, tell us about-

999
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Because you make things up.

1000
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,440
You lie.

1001
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,240
You lie through the whole thing.

1002
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,920
You'll lie about the thing, and then people pay us to say the truth, and you lie about

1003
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,400
the whole thing.

1004
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,920
You just make it up.

1005
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,120
Travis, you do it.

1006
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,480
I'll be your safety net, and when you fuck up, I'll be there to catch you like your father

1007
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,880
figure.

1008
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,400
Put your little hand in mine.

1009
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,280
Lionel Richie, whatever.

1010
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
Now, Cole Richie goes raw.

1011
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,200
He's there.

1012
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,920
Oh God, I can't take the pressure.

1013
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,320
Do it.

1014
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,440
No, you do it.

1015
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,200
Oh, okay, well first we want to congratulate Mike on graduating from Stony Brook University.

1016
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,240
That sounds like a wizard school.

1017
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,760
Go fightin' white fish.

1018
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,440
Is that a wizard school for wizards?

1019
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,240
Wizard school.

1020
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,920
Yes, Mike has graduated-

1021
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,080
Classic.

1022
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,840
Mike graduated with a wizarding degree in computer engineering.

1023
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,040
Now, a lot of people hear that, and they say,

1024
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,840
what, that's not, and I say technomagic, is what I say to those people.

1025
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,800
Circuit spells.

1026
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Yeah, techno wizards.

1027
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,560
It's all about bits and bytes and incantations.

1028
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,320
Where's he going next?

1029
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,800
Oh, he's going to be pursuing his masters at Stony Brook once more, and unfortunately

1030
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,960
his friends, Matt, Tony, Franco, and Sean, they done fucked up, and they have requested

1031
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
that I do the jingle this week.

1032
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,520
Oh, shit.

1033
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,280
You will also need to combo, that means you've been lumped in.

1034
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,600
Oh, by the way, Mike's nickname, the captain.

1035
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,640
I like that.

1036
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,680
I like that, too.

1037
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,640
I like any nickname that's the, unless it's the situation, but the captain is fine.

1038
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,880
Listener Jennifer Manziel writes her husband, Todd, a 40, no, it's not what writes him,

1039
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,920
wishes him a happy 40th birthday on June 29th.

1040
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,720
So just two days away.

1041
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,760
Here's what I know about Todd, rapid fire, chef, Vancouver, BC, before time he was a

1042
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,840
chef back in caveman days.

1043
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:17,440
We have a Boston terrier named Maude, Todd's nickname, gorilla, turning 40, did cover that.

1044
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,800
You're listening to the captain and the gorilla on 94.3.

1045
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
There, there's your jingle.

1046
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
His hair is like lambswool.

1047
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,600
Awesome.

1048
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,360
He plays World of Warcraft.

1049
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,840
That is the order in which I hope he would relate those facts to me, were I to meet Todd.

1050
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,240
Actually, that's how it's listed on his resume.

1051
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,760
Special skills, hair like lambswool.

1052
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,840
Todd, this is a really long business card, but I appreciate you giving it to me.

1053
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,280
Can I feel your hair again?

1054
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,120
So happy birthday to you, Todd.

1055
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,800
Thank you, Jennifer, for wishing Todd such a happy special day.

1056
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,720
Uh, sadly, because of the, I'm just going to say callous misjudgment of Matt, Tony,

1057
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,560
Franco, and Sean, you are going to have a jingle also sung by Travis as he sings about

1058
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,080
the captain and the gorilla.

1059
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,360
I told him to get a Casio keyboard pre-programmed with, with the backing tracks.

1060
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,480
Uh, I do not think he has taken that action.

1061
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,640
So let's see what Travis has whipped up.

1062
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,080
How are we going to, how are we going to?

1063
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,680
Here's what we're going to do, Griffin.

1064
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,840
We're going to sit here in silence as Travis sings us a song about the captain and gorilla.

1065
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,240
So you want, cause I can just do it like acapella, like arocapella.

1066
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,560
Yeah, I think you should definitely do that.

1067
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,440
I can't, like I won't be able to handle.

1068
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,920
We are going to see where this goes.

1069
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,880
Strap in.

1070
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,120
You guys got to shut up so I can pretend like you're not there.

1071
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,160
This is what it's like when Travis has sex too.

1072
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,300
Okay.

1073
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,280
Okay.

1074
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,480
So here's what I've worked up.

1075
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:54,980
Okay.

1076
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,120
God damn it.

1077
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,840
Captain Mike and the gorilla set their boat towards excitement and they sailed down the

1078
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,520
river of dreams.

1079
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:15,200
They had adventures by the score for about 20 years or more, but then everything ends

1080
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,160
or so it seems.

1081
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,480
Now they've grown up and gotten adult jobs.

1082
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,440
He's a chef.

1083
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
He's a technical engineer.

1084
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,720
Is that it?

1085
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,760
Stop laughing.

1086
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,320
I'm not laughing.

1087
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,200
Is that the end of the song?

1088
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,420
No.

1089
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,440
He's a technical engineer.

1090
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,240
Got that bit.

1091
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
Here comes the bridge.

1092
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,960
Now Captain Mike and the gorilla have given up adventure.

1093
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,240
They sold their boat and got a mortgage.

1094
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,640
Did that rhyme with engineer?

1095
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,520
Would that have rhymed if we let you sing it all together?

1096
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,640
Yes, maybe.

1097
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,040
Jesus will know if you're lying.

1098
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,640
And then pretty much the song devolves from there and then the rest of it was something

1099
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,880
about learning that the greatest adventure is life.

1100
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,040
Why are you- why didn't you sing that bit, Travis?

1101
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,800
Do you not know how the song works?

1102
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,160
Is this like an R. Kelly speech breakdown?

1103
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,960
Well now I've lost-

1104
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,320
And then after that point we basically just sing about a free bird flying.

1105
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,840
There's some more guitar noises.

1106
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,920
And then there's a pretty epic bridge.

1107
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,360
Yeah, so it's pretty much a lot of that.

1108
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,760
Say so far, say goodbye to yesterday, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1109
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,640
And then we wrap it up.

1110
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,320
Learn a life lesson.

1111
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,160
Learn a life lesson.

1112
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,800
Explored.

1113
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,200
Yeah, so it's pretty much just like that.

1114
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,840
Like, where were you?

1115
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,480
The world stopped turning and we all think about how sad we were.

1116
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,080
And then there's some guitar.

1117
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,720
And then it's over.

1118
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,600
It's the end of the song.

1119
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,560
It's pretty good.

1120
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,120
What do you think?

1121
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,360
Thanks, Alan Jackson.

1122
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,160
That was a great performance.

1123
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,080
Hey-

1124
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,240
Yeah, now it's like an Indian outlaw.

1125
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,880
It's basically just a meditation on that for another minute and a half.

1126
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,240
I have to do the course a couple more times and have Cherokee chalk to all that stuff.

1127
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,320
There's some more vaguely racist stuff.

1128
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:09,280
A, B, C, C, A, A, B, C, B, B, B, C, A, D, J, A, C, C, B song pattern.

1129
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,840
So-

1130
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,520
Did you see DJ, A, C, C, B, B, B?

1131
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,600
He was at the show last week and he's amazing.

1132
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,120
Oh, fuck.

1133
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,720
It's amazing.

1134
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,760
So thank you guys for, I guess, for that.

1135
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,960
And thank you, Travis.

1136
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,280
Please never, ever make me do that again.

1137
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,840
Since splitting up with my girlfriend two years ago, I've been focusing on ruining my business-

1138
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,080
Nope.

1139
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,360
And spending- Nope.

1140
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,880
I've been focusing on running my business and spending time with friends.

1141
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,560
I'm 23 years old and I have ambitions and goals I would like to achieve.

1142
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,960
Should I be looking for a relationship?

1143
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,560
Most of my friends are engaged.

1144
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,880
Or just carry on doing me and I don't think you have much of a choice.

1145
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,800
Wait for someone to come along undecided in the UK.

1146
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,640
Oh, man.

1147
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,200
It's like this guy's me, like last year when I was 23 and running a business.

1148
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,440
Well, Griffin, how did you make this choice?

1149
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,240
Listen, I've been running my business with just full steam ahead

1150
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,960
and I don't have time to dock in the port.

1151
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,160
My business is a steamboat.

1152
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,120
Let me start over.

1153
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,080
Griffin's in the steamboat business.

1154
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,440
I'm in the steamboat industry.

1155
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,120
It's booming.

1156
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,560
And because it's a hip hop steamboat and the speakers are loud.

1157
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,480
So anyway, the stern wheels of steel is what he calls it.

1158
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,720
This primary is going to keep on rolling.

1159
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:41,760
And I don't have time to stop in the port of love.

1160
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,720
I don't have time to dock there because I'm too busy running my business.

1161
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:55,040
And there's nothing wrong with that because a steamboat in port gets loved.

1162
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,640
But that's not what a steamboat's for, is it?

1163
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Uh, for love?

1164
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,920
No, no, it's nice.

1165
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,280
It's for traveling down rivers.

1166
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,800
No, yeah.

1167
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,440
Or hosting the most bangin' R&B rap and beats concerts in the eastern United States.

1168
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,160
Exactly.

1169
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,720
Listen, Undecided in the UK.

1170
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,920
We all are in the business of spinning plates.

1171
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,760
We all have different things going on.

1172
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:29,200
And sometimes when one plate falls off, the stick that you're spinning it on, the dowel

1173
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,800
rod that you're spinning it on, it shatters like your relationship did.

1174
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,400
It's okay to look at the other plates and be like, well, I gotta make sure these are

1175
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,520
really, really spinning.

1176
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,400
But eventually, you gotta pick that plate back up and put it back on.

1177
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:49,360
If I've learned anything from ABC family movies and the like, people that always just

1178
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,200
devote themselves to their job and don't spend any time with family and friends are

1179
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,560
always the happiest people.

1180
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,600
Oh, yeah?

1181
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,080
Right?

1182
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,120
They never look back on their life and regret the choices they've made.

1183
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,920
I mean, I'm fucking smiles for miles over here.

1184
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,280
Like, you don't have to, because you're spinning- let's go back to the plate spinning

1185
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,120
analogy, because I felt like it was so on the nose.

1186
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,320
Like, you're spinning that plate and it falls off, and then your chore of a girlfriend comes

1187
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,480
in and is like, why are you spinning my plates?

1188
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,000
And it's like, this is my job.

1189
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm a plate spinner.

1190
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
I'm focusing on this right now.

1191
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah, but the problem is, is you don't look back.

1192
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,600
Like, you don't turn 24 and look back on 23.

1193
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,440
You turn like 68, and you're old and alone, and then you're sad.

1194
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,840
You don't look back on 23, Travis?

1195
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,120
I think about how sweet 23 was every time I go to bed in my bed.

1196
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,640
Now you're 24, you're run down.

1197
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,720
Oh, like, I'm already like a fifth of the way through my life.

1198
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,560
Don't think about that.

1199
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,520
Whoa!

1200
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,800
Yeah?

1201
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm going with the 120 years.

1202
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,080
You an electric Neil?

1203
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,320
I mean, every year that gets away from me is another year that I spent alone on this

1204
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,440
fucking steamboat.

1205
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,440
This steamboat sucks.

1206
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,640
I can't sleep on it, because it's just parties all the time.

1207
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,480
What was I thinking?

1208
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,880
To be fair, we tried to talk you out of it.

1209
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,000
Why did I buy this from that shady Cajun businessman?

1210
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,440
This was the worst idea.

1211
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,640
I thought it was going to be like Maverick, but it's not like Maverick.

1212
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,480
It's just shitty hip-hop parties all the time, and I can't sleep.

1213
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,240
Fuck it, and I'm so alone.

1214
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,200
Fuck you, Maverick.

1215
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,400
I thought Jodie Foster was going to come in here and jump my bones, but that's not what

1216
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,040
happened, is it?

1217
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,920
So it's less focusing on your business and more trying to get Jodie Foster to fall in

1218
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,400
love with you.

1219
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
By the way, a little misguided, as it turns out.

1220
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,560
A little bark up the wrong tree there.

1221
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,680
I guess undecided in the UK, what we're saying is, you want to buy a steamboat?

1222
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,120
I'll give it to you cheaper than I got it.

1223
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,080
I know a guy who will cut you a deal.

1224
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,120
Let's do a quick Yahoo.

1225
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,560
Okay.

1226
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:02,960
All right.

1227
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,680
Sounds good.

1228
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,360
This one was sent in by Ryan M.

1229
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,320
Thank you, Ryan.

1230
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user BX, who asks,

1231
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,320
Should Obama try to change his image by wearing body armor and showing the world he is ready

1232
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,880
for action?

1233
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,560
Obama just does not seem presidential enough, and his policy on troop withdrawals are making

1234
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,360
him look soft.

1235
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,320
Here's the thing.

1236
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes.

1237
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,920
Here's what's up.

1238
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,480
I think Obama should dress up in full-blown robot armor.

1239
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,200
I think he should carry around big gun all the time.

1240
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,360
And I think, can we get a rapier?

1241
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,600
Can you carry around a rapier everywhere he goes?

1242
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,320
And like two flags sort of tucked within his back so he looks like some sort of superhero,

1243
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,840
some sort of patriotic superhero.

1244
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,280
I think he should wear a costume reminiscent of George Washington.

1245
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh, you're saying like full-blown powdered wig.

1246
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,880
Yeah.

1247
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,440
Yeah.

1248
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,320
Peg leg.

1249
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,080
Like let's president it up, you know?

1250
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
So we have basically like old-timey Obama or like Psy-Bama.

1251
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,960
Psy-Bama.

1252
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,360
Techno-Bama.

1253
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,480
Okay, okay.

1254
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,760
So what about him in a George Washington costume inside of a robotic exoskeleton?

1255
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,080
Oh, I love it.

1256
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,840
Like, oh, that couldn't get any weirder.

1257
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,280
Him in an exoskeleton.

1258
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,000
It opens up.

1259
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,320
Oh, shit.

1260
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,960
He's in George Washington gear.

1261
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,120
What about instead of body armor, what about under armor?

1262
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,200
He just shows up, shows up completely flexed out.

1263
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,440
And just cuts to Obama running up and down the bleachers and he stops and goes, you know,

1264
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,040
I love Gatorade.

1265
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,640
Obama, you gotta run this country.

1266
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,000
He's like, I can't, I'm sporting.

1267
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,440
Back off.

1268
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,480
They're like, we need you to sign or veto these policies.

1269
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,640
And he's like, I can't, I gotta catch this football.

1270
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,520
Sports president.

1271
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,760
I can't run the country.

1272
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,360
I'm running these wind sprints.

1273
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,920
Here's the thing.

1274
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,240
Every president has his thing, right?

1275
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,440
Like everyone has a scene.

1276
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,000
Like Bill Clinton was the president who loved blow chops, loved getting them.

1277
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,760
And then there was-

1278
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,760
To be fair, he ran on that platform.

1279
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,160
Yeah.

1280
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,840
It's like, who's got two thumbs up?

1281
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,640
There's blow jobs.

1282
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:12,800
Me.

1283
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:13,760
I do.

1284
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,920
He ran on that platform, but not as fast as Obama.

1285
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,640
He's a sports president.

1286
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,280
Well, I don't know.

1287
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,760
That's the thing.

1288
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,680
I feel like Obama hasn't established himself as a particular, but he doesn't have a goof.

1289
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,320
He doesn't have a goof.

1290
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,080
He could be the sword fighting president.

1291
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,720
That'd be good.

1292
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,760
But I'm pretty sure that like Aaron Burr, was he a president?

1293
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,360
No.

1294
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:33,840
Sure.

1295
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,480
Hamilton.

1296
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,440
He was a prez, right?

1297
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,240
One of those guys who was like scrappy.

1298
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,400
One of those pugilistic guys.

1299
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,920
Scrappy, yeah.

1300
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,360
The ones that are like built like a short tank with a big mustache.

1301
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:45,600
Okay.

1302
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,800
But just picture this, right?

1303
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,840
Obama, okay, so the scene is this.

1304
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,280
We're inside the Senate.

1305
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,240
They're trash talking Obama being like, he's soft, he's soft.

1306
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,920
Obama kicks down a door.

1307
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,160
Yeah.

1308
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,560
With robots.

1309
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,400
Shirt unbuttoned to his navel.

1310
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,960
Oh, shit.

1311
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,400
Slices the Constitution in half.

1312
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,120
Well, he wouldn't-

1313
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,240
Stabs a dude.

1314
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,800
Okay.

1315
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,680
Here's a problem.

1316
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,600
Few things with that, that are a problem.

1317
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,240
Like a hundred things that are problematic with that situation.

1318
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,480
Okay.

1319
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,880
I can name one right off the bat.

1320
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,480
Our president is not Mike Hagar.

1321
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,000
He isn't Mike Hagar.

1322
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He's not wearing a belt around his chest.

1323
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,680
Not trying to rescue the mayor's daughter.

1324
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,800
That's problem one.

1325
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,680
That's problem one.

1326
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,600
Problem two, he's not even remotely built like Mike Hagar, Travis.

1327
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,640
Look at him.

1328
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,200
He's good.

1329
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,880
He's a great president and a great leader for our country.

1330
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,040
But he's not a strong man, I don't think.

1331
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,840
He doesn't look like-

1332
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,080
He's never struck me as a particularly-

1333
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,160
He's the cat burglar type.

1334
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,920
Like he'd sneak in from the skylight.

1335
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,360
Yeah.

1336
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,440
And okay, so he can become Obama, our wispiest president.

1337
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:47,680
Yeah.

1338
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,760
I like that.

1339
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,000
Just like behind a door frame, he sneaks in.

1340
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,480
Where'd he go?

1341
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,280
That's his jam.

1342
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,880
He's just wispy all the time.

1343
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,480
You never know where he's going to be.

1344
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,640
So, and by the way, I just realized this.

1345
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,760
I do want to apologize.

1346
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,000
I've now stereotyped Obama as a criminal and good at sports.

1347
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,280
I'm sorry, America.

1348
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,240
I did my best.

1349
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,360
Sorry.

1350
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,040
Sorry, America.

1351
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah, so there's got to be like, what if he could be like our most tender president?

1352
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,240
What if he just like wrote poems?

1353
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,160
Oh, and he did like fireside chats, but instead of being in a wheelchair,

1354
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,760
he was laying on a bearskin rug.

1355
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,000
You saw that video of that baby crying and he was like,

1356
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,560
hold on, let me just, do you mind if I see that baby and the baby shut its fucking mouth?

1357
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,280
Like the moment that his sweet presidential hands,

1358
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,640
his tender, tender presidential digits like touched it.

1359
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,760
You saw that video, right?

1360
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
Because it's, that's what I'm talking about.

1361
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,640
He's got powers.

1362
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,560
The thing is, I can't, I think he should be wearing under armor in all these situations.

1363
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:50,880
Why?

1364
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,160
What?

1365
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,920
Because it's like, if, because if he, he wants to keep that sports door open,

1366
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,480
and I think just wearing under armor says that I'm going to do some sports later,

1367
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,280
or I just got done doing some sports.

1368
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,360
Like he gets those sports points without actually having to do any physical activity.

1369
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,120
So it's like, and he carries around a water bottle,

1370
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,960
like one of those squeezy bottles always.

1371
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,360
Right.

1372
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,160
Analoging.

1373
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,320
Like it tells people like, hey, I just did sports.

1374
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,760
And also I'm too busy to get out of my sportswear because I gotta run this country.

1375
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,320
I gotta make laws and stuff and pass them.

1376
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,880
I'm going to throw out one last idea here.

1377
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,400
Oh, you're, okay, shut, shut it down.

1378
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,360
Barack Obama, the hipster president.

1379
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:33,920
Okay.

1380
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,080
I like this so much.

1381
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,600
So he could, first off, gotta grow a silly little mustache.

1382
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,720
Gotta drink PBR, pretty much exclusive.

1383
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,760
He already does.

1384
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,160
He does?

1385
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah, he loves PBR.

1386
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,480
How do you know that?

1387
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,720
Because it was in all the press photos, like when he was running for president.

1388
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,000
Of him slamming a PBR?

1389
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah.

1390
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,840
God damn, if I'd known that, I would have voted for him twice.

1391
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,880
Unpossible.

1392
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,360
Travis, if you have a picture of the president slamming,

1393
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,360
if you at home have a picture of the president slamming a PBR,

1394
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:05,920
Hold on.

1395
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,840
I need it in the forums today.

1396
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,680
Obama PBR images.

1397
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:13,760
Yeah.

1398
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,200
Wait, no, that's photoshopped.

1399
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,400
Get out of here, Travis.

1400
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,560
All of this is real.

1401
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,120
Look it up.

1402
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,200
It didn't give me the pictures I craved, but if you've got one not photoshopped,

1403
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,760
I want to see real pictures of our commander in chief slamming a PBR.

1404
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,880
Slamming a God's beer.

1405
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,200
I think it's a real thing.

1406
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,320
That's Todd's beer.

1407
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,360
Give it back.

1408
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,200
So I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1409
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,040
First, some super quick housekeeping stuff.

1410
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,760
This is the big one.

1411
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,520
The big one you've been waiting for.

1412
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,040
If you go to maxfunstore.com right now, you will be able to buy the brand new

1413
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,400
My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt,

1414
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,640
designed by Mr. Justin Rousseau or Justin Rousseau, depending on how French I'm feeling.

1415
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,960
It is an amazing design.

1416
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,760
I adore it.

1417
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,600
I could say that because I didn't have anything to do with it.

1418
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,880
It comes in cobalt for dudes and turquoise for ladies.

1419
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,880
We had a lot of people asking for a turquoise girl shirt.

1420
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,160
And so we settled on turquoise for the ladies, especially cut for them.

1421
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,320
These are high quality, soft, beautiful shirts.

1422
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,160
They have a tag you can tear away.

1423
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,360
So that's super nice.

1424
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,160
They're alternative apparel, which is President Obama's favorite t-shirt brand

1425
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,040
because he doesn't like he doesn't like those lane stream tees.

1426
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,600
What what you need to do is be like Mr.

1427
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,880
Dr. Muffin, who's my my hero in yours, Gregory.

1428
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,040
I call him you.

1429
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,520
You wear the shirt and you get on TV.

1430
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,240
That's key.

1431
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,600
Does it matter what show they get on?

1432
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,360
Don't get on Tosh.

1433
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,440
Again, because we've covered that market.

1434
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,320
Also, don't get on cops unless it's you.

1435
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,920
Unless it's you taking out a dude who just committed a crime.

1436
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,120
Like you straight up tackle him and stand up and point at your shirt

1437
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,080
and try to sneak into like photos or whatever.

1438
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,400
Try to get it into cool places.

1439
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,680
Our buddy Bob Ball has actually made like a video series where his

1440
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,640
in B&B and T-shirt goes on tours and

1441
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:23,680
if we could just like a series of people being that guy who like ducks in the back of pictures

1442
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,600
and points at their in B&B shirt.

1443
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,960
Like I would like that to become like the new like meme.

1444
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,680
Get buried in your shirt.

1445
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,720
Get buried in it.

1446
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,880
When you buy a lot of them build a house off.

1447
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,160
Just then you'll live.

1448
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,680
Then it'll be forever.

1449
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,960
Our show will live forever.

1450
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,760
Go buy one of those maxfundstore.com is the website.

1451
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,480
Go get one.

1452
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,760
Go get one for someone you love.

1453
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,200
What better way to introduce the show to someone

1454
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,120
than get them a T-shirt and say you like this now.

1455
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,880
Also, go to the forums that's at maximumfund.org.

1456
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,480
You can find those and come talk about our show and all the other fine maximum programs.

1457
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,800
Last week Griffin made a joke about nomenclature and drinking game

1458
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:13,120
and we got so many emails about rules for an MB&B AM drinking game

1459
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,560
which I think that that's a great idea but we're not going to limit your creativity.

1460
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:23,760
So go to the forums and somebody start some line of discussion about.

1461
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,440
I have a great MB&B AM drinking game and it is while you listen to our show

1462
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,680
you drink an adult beverage and when you feel thirsty

1463
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,440
you refresh yourself with that beverage.

1464
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,200
Okay so every time you feel like taking a drink you take a drink.

1465
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,800
Every time yeah every time the spirit compels you to drink your drink

1466
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,720
then you drink it like a fucking adult.

1467
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,360
That's I mean that's less of a game.

1468
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:45,840
Is it?

1469
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,040
To live will be a great adventure think about it.

1470
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,000
I learned that from your fucking song Travis so don't tell me that's not true.

1471
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,840
Travis and also go to bit.ly forward slash MB&B AM tune one

1472
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,160
and watch the MB&B AM super show it's absolutely amazing.

1473
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,120
I want a hundred can we commission them to make a hundred of those?

1474
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:13,040
Yes we want to say thank you so much to people talking about our show on twitter.

1475
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,920
Jonah Skye is trying to get people on board.

1476
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,920
Deadpool Skye continuing this theme that I've just started now.

1477
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,640
I'm seeing a lot of a lot of people listening to us on road trips

1478
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,160
like Ben Laden and and Media Fairy.

1479
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,520
Media Fairy was on a long one.

1480
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,200
I think that's just great because I also listen to podcasts on road trips.

1481
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,360
Not my own podcast but other people's.

1482
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,600
That would be pretty cool if you listened to your own one.

1483
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,120
Hey do you remember when I did this goof?

1484
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,040
So thank you to everybody who's who's been listening

1485
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:54,240
and uh Hey Friend, Heavy Mono, Neemi, everybody.

S Diesel.

1502
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,640
Great Nanners, Maya Love.

Oh that Carrie is back in the fold after taking a month off.

1504
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,920
We're happy to have her.

1505
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,800
This is this is a train that keeps on rolling.

1506
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,520
Eric, Patrick, and Chimason who got a fucking stupid show tattooed on their bodies forever.

1507
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,400
Yep.

1508
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:36,720
Yeah.

1509
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,640
Yeah, Corinne Taggs, what's up?

1510
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,840

1511
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,280
I love you guys so much I'm fucking angry about it.

1512
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,000

1513

Lil Sar is helping out.

01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:07,840
Pitch it in.

1528
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:08,960
Okay.

1529

Daryl Stripper.

1530
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:10,880
All right.

1531
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,760
So that's our angry segment about how much we love you.

Fucking love you man.

1533
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,480
Our parents used to have that segment pretty frequently actually.

1534
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,160
So thank you guys.

1535
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,600

My body is ready Griffin.

1537
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,600
Give me the last question.

1538
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,440
This one was sent in by Cal.

1539
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,080
Thanks Cal.

1540
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:32,640
I love you.

01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,520
You fucking dick.

1542
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,040
Uh it's by Yahoo answer user Raymond who asks does this story sound too cliche?

1543
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,960
Male lawyer plus female cop plus friction between the two plus murder plus mystery?

1544
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,360
Justin McElroy.

1545
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

1546
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1547
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,200
This has been my brother my brother and me.

1548
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,080
Kiss your dad.

1549
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,200
Square on the lips.

1550
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,960
Keep your heart three stacks.

1551
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,920
Keep your heart.

1552
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,080
Hey keep your heart three stacks.

1553
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,120
Keep your heart.

1554
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,400
Man these girls are smart.

1555
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,040
Three stacks.

1556
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,160
