1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Live from the floor of Comic-Con, it's my brother, my brother, and me,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm Marmaduke.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm Naruto. Is that a thing?

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,120
Yeah, you're Naruto. I'm Marmaduke. Travis, who are you cosplaying as?

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
Beetle Bailey.

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh man, Travis won it.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Sarge is back on the case. He's going after Trav again.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,120
Travis has actually matched up Beetle Bailey and Big Bad Beetleborgs,

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,360
which everyone knows what we're all about. It's basically Beetle Bailey in a robot bug suit.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
It's Big Bad Beetle Bailey.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
If this is supposed to be a comic convention, there should be way more stink lines floating

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,160
around this place. That's all I can think is like, if this were a comic book, you wouldn't

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,360
even be able to see the signs. You wouldn't be able to navigate the floor.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
You're talking about like pig pen-esque stink lines.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,880
Pig pen stink lines.

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,760
PU flies.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,440
I think there should be more PU flies. I think if you wanted to cosplay as something,

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,640
you should just have visible stink lines emanating from your body.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
Because come on, man. Look at yourself.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,960
That's a slippery slope though, because if I ever went to Comic-Con,

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
I would just walk around and be like, oh, you're PU lines. Oh, you're stink lines.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh, no. You just kind of have. That's just the stink of the con.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,800
We're not actually there, but through the magic of audio and imagination, we can be there.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm really happy to see all of the Kevin James cosplayers this year.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,720
I bet Kevin James is there. I bet he's dressed up like the fattest Doctor Who.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,960
Yeah, it shouldn't be tough to find a fat guy at Comic-Con.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,440
Let's just all keep an eye peeled for him.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,240
Doctor Who took my lasagna starring Kevin James.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
Doctor Who moved my beef butter sandwich.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm starving.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Doctor Who could ever love a man that can't put their arms around.

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
That's a pretty good cosplay. Comic-Con cosplayer.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
Um, so this is obviously an advice show for the modern era.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
I am your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Griffin, who's transported coming to you for the first time

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
in beautiful Austin Tech House.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Such a lovely city. So lovely. So arid. I love how arid it is.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Is everything Adobe?

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,760
Everything is Adobe Photoshop and Premiere and Sound Booth.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
So. That sounds nice.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
It's a little software joke for everybody.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Hope you enjoyed it.

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,200
You can expect much more of that in the hour to come.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Griffin, you said it was arid.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
So with your blonde hair and blue eyes,

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
you must be fitting in really well.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,880
That's not what that word means.

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
But it's close.

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,520
You kept saying, I really want to move there.

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,760
It's arid. And then you would wink.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
And I wouldn't understand.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,880
But now I think I finally get it.

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,040
So you might call it the master state

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
and I would wink again.

61
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
And you'd be like, well, now you're just, everyone knows.

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm not even being clever anymore.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,240
Hey, let's get into some advice.

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,400
I've got the best group of friends.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Problem is, they're all guys.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
Did I mention I'm a girl?

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
You didn't. You know you didn't.

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
You just wrote that as two sentences in.

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,600
You know you didn't include that.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,440
Two sentences deep. You didn't know.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,040
Of course you wrote you're a girl.

72
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
It said right there.

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
And you knew that going in.

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,320
And this question is a trick.

75
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm not sure I want to read.

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
Like, what other surprises does she have in store?

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
But here's the twist.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm a girl. Follow me.

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,120
Follow me.

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
I feel like she's wilding out.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,640
Oh, you think it's a punk situation

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
where the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,960
Well, let's see.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
I've always gotten along better with the opposite gender,

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
but I'm getting sick of all the testosterone.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
I really need some female friends in my life,

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,600
but don't know where to start.

88
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
What's the best way to make some girlfriends

89
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
without appearing desperate?

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
That's from tired of the sausage fest.

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Who are, who do you, who the fuck do you think we are?

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Yeah.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,760
Yeah, who, why do you think that we have any,

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
any wisdom to impart to you in this particular situation?

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,760
You could like braid each other's hair,

96
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,040
get manicures.

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
But you got to find, you got to find someone to braid first.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
You can't just walk up.

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
No, you can just do a drive by.

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,080
You can do a drive by braiding.

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,040
Let me see those locks.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
We're going to be real good friends.

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,960
We're going to get real close.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
Let's go get our nails done.

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Getting your nails did is good.

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Because you can just open a nail salon

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
and then befriend your, your agents.

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Ooh, that, that could be a really,

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
that could work out really well.

110
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
But that's, you don't have to open up a small business

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,560
to make friends.

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Well, that's true.

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
That's quite an investment on,

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
on something that may not pan out.

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Maybe, hmm.

116
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,280
Go to the gym, join like a spinning class or something.

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
The problem is like, you're, I don't know how,

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
if you, if I knew how to meet girls.

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,360
Yeah.

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
Like, man, if you can crack that particular case,

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
then, then we'd have something.

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
But I, I, how does anybody meet a girl?

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,120
I don't know.

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,520
I don't remember how I met my wife.

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
I just knew her.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
And then we were wed.

127
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,120
I believe I've always known her.

128
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah.

129
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
She just was.

130
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
She just was.

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
And then I married her.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
But I do not remember, I don't think we actually met.

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
I don't think I've ever met a girl.

134
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
Now that I think about it,

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
I don't think I've ever met one.

136
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,480
But I would say that I think that making new friends,

137
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
no matter what gender,

138
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,120
kind of follow the same rule of thumb

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
as trying to find like a boyfriend or girlfriend,

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
a romantic relationship,

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,760
which is if you go out looking for it,

142
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,440
you're going to scare all of them away.

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
You know, if you roll up and you start a conversation

144
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
with a girl at, you know, Starbucks or something,

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
and you're like, so can we like hang out

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
and be best friends and stuff?

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
She is not going to want to hang out with you ever again

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
because you are scary.

149
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840
I don't think this listener would do that,

150
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,960
Travis, what you just said.

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,360
I don't think-

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,080
Well, she asked, you know,

153
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
how to do it without appearing desperate.

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,600
And I think, you know, you build slowly

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
the same way you do any relationship.

156
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
You know, you hang out a couple of times,

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,640
you make plans, anything like that.

158
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,840
Just, you know, if you meet someone and they seem fun,

159
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,480
and, you know, you would like to hang out with them more,

160
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
just ask them.

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,000
I feel like you should just embrace the situation

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,560
you have now.

163
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
I feel like you could have a real

164
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
queen of the Nile situation on your hands

165
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
if you play your cards right.

166
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Oh, really?

167
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,120
Sort of like a weighted on hand and foot

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
queen of the voice type situation?

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
Carried around town on a palanquin.

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
Like, I think this could all,

171
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,560
I think this would all be really, really good.

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Don't any of these guys have girlfriends

173
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,920
or sisters or anything?

174
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, that's a good connection.

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah.

176
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,480
Or moms.

177
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Or moms?

178
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,760
Moms are great friends.

179
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,640
With their, they've got a lot of good stories.

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
They have those jeans.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,560
Sure.

182
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
That look like that?

183
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,320
This sucks.

184
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,480
We don't have, like, I don't know any girls.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm almost certain that they don't exist.

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
This is one of those things, though,

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
where we get that question all the time.

188
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
How do I make friends?

189
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I don't know.

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
What's your skill set?

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,200
Like, what, you know?

192
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,480
I need to know something about you.

193
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,760
What are you bringing to the table?

194
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
What, are you funny?

196
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
Or maybe you're really smart or you're rich.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,640
What are your strengths that are going to draw people into you?

198
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Because there's only three,

199
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,400
and they're funny, smart, or rich.

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,440
So which are you?

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,000
Which, which skills are you?

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Or super attractive.

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,080
Four.

204
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Super attractive is the other one.

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Maybe you have this army of guys that follows you around

206
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,320
that can lift heavy things for them

207
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
and help them move and stuff.

208
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Why don't you send those guys out?

209
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,760
Like, like, like birds of prey

210
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,520
and say, go bring me some women.

211
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Fetch me women, men.

212
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
I think we've, I think we've probably constructed

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,960
a far different relationship between her and her male friends.

214
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,680
It's kind of a hive mind thing here.

215
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah, right.

216
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
We've established her as quite the queen bee.

217
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm not sure it rolls out just like that.

218
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,760
But I think that, I think asking them,

219
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
like, like trying to hang out with,

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
like if they got a sister or a mom or something,

221
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
I think that that's actually a pretty good,

222
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,840
a pretty good play.

223
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,240
You know, meeting people through people is always easier

224
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
than making that initial connection.

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Everybody has a hip aunt.

226
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,560
Everybody's got a cool aunt, Julie.

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
A lot of my friends and also my brother

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
are trying to tell me to live with my fiance

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
before we are married.

230
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
I don't like that idea because I'm trying to follow

231
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,360
the biblical teaching on the situation.

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
And I've told them this on many occasions.

233
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Could you please help me with this?

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah.

235
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,560
Well, Mike, for people trying to live a biblical lifestyle,

236
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
you have certainly come to the right program.

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,880
But let me walk you through what my Bible says.

238
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,280
Of course, my Bible is the gift book,

239
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,920
the bro code based on the hit television show

240
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,680
How I Met Your Mother.

241
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,320
This is supposedly written by Barney Stinson,

242
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
but I'm pretty sure they had a workshop of ghost writers.

243
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,960
That's my Bible.

244
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,720
And my Bible says, just go for it, bro.

245
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,360
Really?

246
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
Yeah, that's what it says in my Bible.

247
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Just live with her.

248
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,760
And then they've got like a picture of Barney

249
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
from How I Met Your Mother, and he's just sort of sitting.

250
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,200
He's kind of winking at the camera,

251
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,960
but you kind of know what he's saying.

252
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,560
Is he wearing a suit, perchance?

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, he has suited up, I think, is how you would say it.

254
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
It's a great gift book.

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,480
It's available for $14.99 at your local, well, not Borders, but-

256
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Spencer's.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
Spencer's gifts.

258
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
Spencer's is filling the Borders void now.

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,320
They're just selling literature and blow up fuck dolls.

260
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I don't think that Spencer's sells blow up fuck dolls.

261
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,120
Oh yeah, they do.

262
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
They do, but as a goose.

263
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
They're not like sexy blow up fuck dolls.

264
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
They're like Queen Elizabeth.

265
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,080
Get it?

266
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm with you.

267
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,360
Hey, Mike, I would tell them that they need to back off

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
and you're going to do your thing,

269
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
and they're going to do their thing,

270
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
and then later where they're in hell burning forever,

271
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,680
they can get back with you on whether or not you made the right decision.

272
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
But for right now, no dice.

273
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
Quick counterpoint.

274
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,520
I don't think it's a terrible, awful idea to live with your fiance before marriage,

275
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,120
but if you don't want to, like-

276
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
Sure, right.

277
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,840
If you're asking for what I think you should do,

278
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,920
what I think you should do is live with somebody before you marry them,

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,480
but I think that what you don't need right now is more people telling you

280
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,080
what to do in your life.

281
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,680
You don't need an advice show.

282
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,240
You need a show called Back Off Mike, where just guys tell people-

283
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
Step out my grill.

284
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
Get out Mike's grill.

285
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,080
Starring nobody.

286
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Everything and every major decision in your life,

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,040
there will be just countless people that think they know it better than you

289
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
because they've done it before,

290
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,680
or they've seen it in movies,

291
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
or they've read it in magazines.

292
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
Tell them just to back the fuck off because it's your situation.

293
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,080
Advice is always welcome,

294
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,640
but at the end of the day, it's your decision, not theirs.

295
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,920
At the end of the day, step off.

296
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm going to interject here and just say that

297
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
ignore everything that Justin and Travis are saying because you gots to live with them.

298
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,640
Oh, you totally do,

299
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,800
but you just don't need to listen to your friends and brother.

300
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
Listen to us.

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
You gots to listen to us because you gots to live with her.

302
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh man, because she does some shit that you don't know about yet

303
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
that you need to know about before you get betrothed.

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,480
What if she poops in the shower?

305
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,480
That's not something you're going to get until you share a residence with her.

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
Mike, can I throw this out?

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,080
Two-bedroom apartment.

308
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,000
You're thinking that'll keep it holy.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, I'm saying he can live with her

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,400
without necessarily caving in on the biblical teachings.

311
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,520
Hey, Travis.

312
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Hey, Travis.

313
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,160
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is not an RA.

314
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,800
We're not trying to fucking thwart the dean here, okay?

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,160
Like, it's Jesus.

316
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,520
He knows what's up.

317
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,720
He's not fucking fooled by your chicanery.

318
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
He knows the score.

319
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Like, he's not like,

320
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
oh, looks like two different apartments from way up here.

321
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
Where I sit, this seems pretty kosher.

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
You got to get a three-bedroom apartment, right?

323
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,840
And then you guys sleep on the outer perimeter bedrooms

324
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,400
and the middle bedroom, that's where the Holy Spirit sleeps.

325
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll leave a little space there.

326
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,720
He'll appreciate the gesture,

327
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
even though he will continue to help forever.

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
My body is ready for Yahoo.

329
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
Let me see if I can help you with that.

330
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,880
Oh, this one was sent in by Gabriel Pinto.

331
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,400
Okay.

332
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Usually these questions are just like super bad ideas,

333
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
but this one is actually like,

334
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,640
this one's actually a really good solution

335
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
to an important problem.

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,440
It was asked by, ah, fuck, ASDFVBSD,

337
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
which makes me think that he took his name selection

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,800
pretty seriously.

339
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,000
And he asked, why don't they STD test everyone all at once?

340
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,120
Okay.

341
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
Like to kill off all of the treatable stuff

342
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,840
and alert people with non-curable ones

343
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,160
so they can not spread it and also treat it.

344
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
Because like now there is super gonorrhea

345
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
that isn't curable yet.

346
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
And this is going to happen with every curable STD eventually.

347
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,240
So he wants-

348
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,280
He's saying like just massive people round up.

349
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,640
He's talking, he's saying,

350
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,120
hey, everyone on the earth, it's chlamydia day.

351
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay.

352
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
And everyone goes to the doctor

353
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
and they get their chlamydia cured.

354
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
And then guess what guys, chlamydia is gone.

355
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,000
So, okay, wait, hold on.

356
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,520
So on one day, everyone in the world-

357
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Chlamydia day.

358
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,880
Chlamydia day.

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
Yeah, thank you.

360
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
Everyone in the world-

361
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,800
On the planet.

362
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,560
Will simultaneously go to the hospital.

363
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, yes.

364
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,320
This is the concept.

365
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
And they would have-

366
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,640
So the world grinds to a halt so we can get rid of chlamydia.

367
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,560
It'll be like the rapture, but for wiener disease.

368
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,520
Is that what you're saying?

369
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,680
We got three and a half billion dicks.

370
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,160
We got three and a half billion vaginas.

371
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Let's just get them all peeped at the same moment in time.

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
And then where did all of our diseases go?

373
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600
I don't know where my chlamydia went.

374
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
And by my chlamydia, I mean the earth's chlamydia.

375
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
It's gone.

376
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
Okay, but real quick, just brain teaser here.

377
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,840
Okay.

378
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,040
Who checks the checkers?

379
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,400
They check each other?

380
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,000
They check each other.

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,720
What are you-

382
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,960
I think here's the one of the infrastructure issues you're gonna run into here.

383
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,200
Okay.

384
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,960
Is that you're gonna have a lot of beautiful people getting treated for chlamydia all at once.

385
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,480
And there's gonna be a line of other people waiting.

386
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
No.

387
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
Yeah, they're gonna re-hook up.

388
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,480
They're gonna go to the coat check room at the hospital.

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
At the hospital, the coat check room.

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
The coat check room.

391
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,680
The champagne room.

392
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,760
The lab coat check room.

393
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,960
And they're gonna hook up.

394
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Hey, quick side note, not to derail us too much.

395
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,760
Did you know that doctors sometimes prescribe beer?

396
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,200
No.

397
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
They have prescription beer at the hospital.

398
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,160
Like if you're an alcoholic-

399
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
No, you're fucking with me.

400
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,400
They don't want you to have the DTs there while you're getting treated for something else.

401
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,320
So they have prescription beer.

402
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
Is it MGD-64?

403
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
They will like prescribe you a cold one.

404
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,040
Oh, it's gotta be the war.

405
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,400
It's gotta be like Schlitz.

406
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,120
Like he needs 30 seasons of Schlitz.

407
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,240
Shasta beer.

408
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,280
This is Faygo beer.

409
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Like beer.

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,080
But yeah.

411
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
That's only gonna help fuel the chlamydia day fuck party.

412
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, shit.

413
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,160
Right.

414
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
They're gonna open all the prescription beers and they're gonna get crazy.

415
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,280
So what we've established here is that by trying to cure chlamydia, we create a perfect storm.

416
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,200
Ground zero of a white squall of peepee diseases.

417
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,520
Yeah.

418
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,000
Uh-huh.

419
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,280
To the point where it becomes corporeal and takes human form.

420
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Oh, gross.

421
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,360
Like Mr. Yacht.

422
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,440
And then you've gotta call the ghostbusters.

423
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
Exactly.

424
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
Obviously.

425
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Obviously.

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,080
Guys, what kind of world do you live in?

427
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,560
Let me ask.

428
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,680
There's two worlds that we can live in and you can decide.

429
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,160
Okay.

430
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't want to be in the one with the man made of chlamydia.

431
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,560
If that's-

432
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Well, option A, do we want a world with like a Golgotha-esque demon made of venereal diseases?

433
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Or do we want to live in a world where super gonorrhea is a thing that anyone can get at

434
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
any time for sitting on the wrong toilet seat?

435
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,000
That's a really, when you make it the point like that, it seems a lot more compelling, actually.

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,040
You can stay away from the Golgotha-esque demon.

437
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
You can stay away from him.

438
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
No, the good thing about the demon is that he gives us something concrete to fight.

439
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,440
To fear?

440
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,040
So often you hear people say, it's time for us to fight AIDS, but now it'll be like no real-

441
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh, if you could like fisticuffs just like go around and around with AIDS.

442
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,960
Get a gun, hide behind those sandbags, and help us fight the AIDS monster.

443
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,920
Do you hear about Jim?

444
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh, no, what?

445
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,560
Totally took out AIDS the other day.

446
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah.

447
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,560
What if single-handedly with a saber-

448
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,480
Beat the ever-loving shit out of it.

449
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,280
Way to go.

450
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,240
I'm uncomfortable with this question.

451
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,000
I didn't know diseases can become super diseases if we let them go unchecked.

452
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Like, that's horrifying to me.

453
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,160
Oh, yeah.

454
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah.

455
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,520
Well, and our over-reliance on antibiotics will make a lot of things untreatable.

456
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
And then they evolve.

457
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
Yeah, well, do you know what we can do?

458
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
Like Pokemon.

459
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,040
Do you know what we can do is catch them all.

460
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,120
No, you know what we can do is-

461
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,360
What?

462
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,800
Get everybody to go to the hospital on the same day and then just cure them.

463
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,840
Let's do another Yahoo.

464
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:54,880
Okay.

465
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
This is questions, of course, that we've taken from the Yahoo answer service.

466
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Stolen.

467
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
Stolen-ish.

468
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,960
Proloined.

469
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,040
And are answering them.

470
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Dragooned.

471
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,480
How about this one?

472
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
This one was sent in by Elizabeth Kleven.

473
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,040
Thank you, Elizabeth.

474
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley Judd, who asks,

475
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,520
do you think it's a bad idea to name your kids after characters of your favorite movie?

476
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,560
I really want to name my future kids after Harry Potter characters, but nothing too overbearing.

477
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,520
I was thinking names like Ivana Luna, Aiden James, Hermione Evelyn, or Evelyn Hermione.

478
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,760
No.

479
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
Lily Charlotte.

480
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
What do you think?

481
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,560
If you're Harry Potter fans, add some of your opinions of names.

482
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Pools.

483
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,800
Okay, I like Harry Potter.

484
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
Don't fucking do that.

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
This is my son Cookshanks Dobby.

486
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,080
Yeah, this is Dobby Cookshanks.

487
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,240
This is my son punch me right in the balls in, throw me in a locker, and leave me there forever.

488
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
This is my son uninvited to every party ever.

489
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
This is my son fart in my mouth in gym class.

490
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,680
This is my son getting jacked on PCP and threw himself out a bedroom window.

491
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,240
He's had a rough life.

492
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,480
It's maybe dates back to, it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment,

493
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,800
but it's probably when I decided to name him Hagrid Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

494
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Hi, I'm Stephen Voldemort, and I would appreciate it if you

495
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
just stop bullying me just constantly.

496
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
And if you do not mind, please stop saying my name out.

497
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,760
It's disrespectful.

498
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,800
It is troubling.

499
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
Sorry, I'm not better at sports, but...

500
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,680
And please, it's Steve, he who shall not be named.

501
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm Stephen, he who shall not be named.

502
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,680
He who shall not be kissed.

503
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
He who shall not be invited.

504
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,040
Don't ever.

505
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,640
He who shall not be successful.

506
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
Poor kid. Don't ever do this.

507
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,320
Don't do this thing.

508
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Don't do this thing that you're saying.

509
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,360
This thing you've said, don't do this.

510
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,240
Haley, don't do this thing because for the reasons that we've just outlined,

511
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
and also Harry Potter's a book, not a movie, you dummy.

512
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,840
I mean, it's also a movie, but it's a book first.

513
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
And thirdly, there's so many other better movie names that you can use.

514
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:19,760
Sure.

515
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,040
I mean, Condorman, it's right there.

516
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,120
Condorman, T-Rex from Jurassic Park is my favorite character.

517
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,680
I mean, you could pretty much go any direction.

518
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,120
This is my son, Val Kilmer Batman.

519
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,760
Yeah.

520
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,200
You have to be so specific.

521
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Yeah, you really do wanna be.

522
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,320
You don't wanna be George Clooney just swarthing around with swarviness as that Batman.

523
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
You want that Val Kilmer Batman.

524
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
That's the recipe for success.

525
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
No nipple Batman is the best Batman.

526
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
It's the only Batman.

527
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,680
The only Batman.

528
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,680
One other thing, if you name your kid Hermione anything, who do you think you're fooling?

529
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,600
That's true.

530
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
Who do you think isn't gonna go, oh, Harry Potter?

531
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,040
And you'd be like, no, no, no.

532
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,720
I was way into that name before Harry Potter came out.

533
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
The problem is you might be able to extract a name that would work for you,

534
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
but you would have to get, to make it a name that's not immediately identifiable as a Harry

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Potter name, you'd have to get so deep catalog that I think the effect would be lost.

536
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,480
Yeah, definitely don't name your offspring Hogwarts,

537
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
because that's not an attractive name.

538
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,080
Also, I think that tomorrow everybody should go to the hospital at the same time

539
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
so we can finally cure Hogwarts.

540
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,440
I have warts just up and down my hog.

541
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
It is a bad scene.

542
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
It is a bad scene down there.

543
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
Up until two weeks ago, almost all my meals were provided either by my loving parents

544
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
or the surprisingly excellent dining facilities at my university.

545
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,240
Now, however, I've been living in an apartment for the past two weeks,

546
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,280
and in that time, practically all I've managed to put into my body is an embarrassing amount

547
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,160
of delivery pizza and chain restaurant burritos.

548
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,240
And fuck, I'm hungry.

549
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
I'm sick and tired of this, and I need new things to eat.

550
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
What should I do to broaden my palette?

551
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
That's from Culinary Child.

552
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,000
Your first two or three years out of college, you're going to eat like an asshole, man.

553
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,440
I ate like a fucking, I ate like a jerk.

554
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,880
All I do is eat bacon and drink orange soda.

555
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Griffin would come over to my house after he got out of college.

556
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
He would come over to my house sometimes,

557
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:48,160
and he would have bags from fast food places that were so crowded around,

558
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
I didn't even know they really existed.

559
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,160
Those places you see, but no one ever actually eats there.

560
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,600
Did you get a frost top?

561
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
What are you doing?

562
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,000
Chompers?

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
That's not even a restaurant.

564
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Who goes to Chompers?

565
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Griffin, where the fuck did you find a Rax?

566
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,560
Not only that, but I mean, I ate a lot of ramen.

567
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,400
I would put hot dogs in the ramen.

568
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
I'd be like, oh yeah, protein, what's up?

569
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh, it's such a bad scene.

570
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,920
You got to do that though.

571
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,640
You got to learn.

572
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
You got to be carefully taught.

573
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,760
The two things that I can actually recommend is one,

574
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:35,280
find yourself a cooking guru, to use a popular phrase.

575
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,560
Is it popular? Somebody on TV or who writes books that

576
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,720
is sort of at your skill level, because there's different,

577
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,920
different people are sort of doing different television shows,

578
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,360
different books are in a different level.

579
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,480
I like Alton Brown a lot.

580
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,920
You can get on board with him.

581
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,880
There's another guy, his name's the cooking guy,

582
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Sam Zien, I think, Z-I-E-N.

583
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,160
And just start making some of the stuff that looks the easiest,

584
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,360
and you build from there.

585
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
If you go to the store, there are countless books that are written to be easy,

586
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
that are like three ingredient meals and 10 minute meals,

587
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,880
that kind of thing that are designed for people that are just starting out

588
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
and cooking and have no idea what they're doing.

589
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,960
The only thing is to be prepared that it takes some forethought to do

590
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,720
any kind of cooking meals where you can't just throw a frozen pizza in the oven.

591
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,040
You need to make sure you have all the ingredients.

592
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,800
Get on board before you're hungry.

593
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,040
I mean, get the wheel going before that.

594
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,640
I actually prefer the culinary stylings of Paula Deen,

595
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,560
because she cooks and eats like she's gonna commit suicide later that day.

596
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Yeah, like, fuck this, like, ah, fuck it.

597
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,840
I'm gonna make a burger out of donuts.

598
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,960
Fuck you and fuck me.

599
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,360
She eats and cooks like her parents named her Severus Snape.

600
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm just ready to just wrap it up.

601
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,640
And she drinks pudding pretty much.

602
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
Out of a goblet.

603
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,240
Yeah, so another good one is find recipes for things that you like to eat at restaurants.

604
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:23,280
You know, like a Taste Just Like or, you know, copycat recipes, things like that,

605
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,680
where you have something to weigh it against.

606
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,600
Like, okay, I'm getting there because this tastes kind of like that thing I know I like.

607
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,320
Do you guys have a meal that you, like, your go-to meal that you are, like,

608
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
super good at making that was one of the first things you learned how to make?

609
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,240
Like, for real?

610
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,740
Yeah.

611
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,880
You could do, it's pretty easy, like, Italian sausage and, like, chopped up, you know, bell peppers

612
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,560
and some Parmesan cheese and noodles.

613
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,000
And, like, you make, like, a pasta dish and it's, like, four ingredients.

614
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
It's really, really easy.

615
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
That's a good one.

616
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,480
I make a, you boys have had it, they're, like, chimmy-ritos.

617
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
Like, half chimichanga, half burritos.

618
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,840
Make them the other.

619
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,320
Oh, yeah.

620
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,960
Remember that?

621
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,600
That's good.

622
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
If you want that recipe, I'll make sure I get in touch.

623
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,160
Actually, I stole that from Sam Z and the cooking guy, so track him down.

624
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
My jam is bacon-wrapped dates.

625
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,760
Super easy to make.

626
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,680
I mean, you can't eat it for a meal, but you can make it for a party and roll up to it.

627
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,560
Like, what's up?

628
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,600
Who brought this food?

629
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
And be like, I made it.

630
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
Did you really do that?

631
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,760
Yeah.

632
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
That's pretty cool.

633
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
We had it up there that one time with Jordan and Jesse.

634
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,760
Jesse was like, oh, you can make those.

635
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,400
And then I made it.

636
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,920
It's like, you can just make them.

637
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
This isn't very funny, but it's...

638
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,000
No, it's true.

639
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,360
Everybody make bacon-wrapped dates.

640
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,560
They're going to blow your mouth off your face.

641
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,160
Do you know how I got started cooking?

642
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,360
I got started and it's kind of cheesy and funny, but this book called A Man, a Can, and a Plan.

643
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
You've talked about it before on this show.

644
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Yeah, and you can make it with, like, three canned ingredients, you know?

645
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
And then I got started on that in college and making everything else, you know?

646
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,760
But my advice right now is go to the store and just kind of walk the aisles and look

647
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,360
for things that look interesting to you.

648
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,160
And if you're like, oh, maybe a pasta dish tonight, and then go to the internet and look

649
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
up different pasta recipes.

650
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
You know, find something where you like...

651
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
Don't get that recipe off Yahoo!

652
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,440
No.

653
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,000
Nope.

654
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
Take your sister's hair and then...

655
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,000
You can go to allrecipes.com.

656
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
That's the one I normally use.

657
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,320
I have my own...

658
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,120
I have an account there and I have a little digital recipe box where I put all my jams.

659
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,960
All my hot jams.

660
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
Have you unlocked enough food points to get any cool avatars?

661
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,640
Yes.

662
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
All I do is browse recipes and give people comments.

663
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
Helpful comments like, too much pepper.

664
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,360
I unlocked the Mario Batali mustache yesterday and that really lets people know what level

665
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
of cooking skill I'm working with.

666
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
Anyway, listen.

667
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,240
If I want to eat this week, I'm going to need some money.

668
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:12,720
And to do that, to buy the food with the money, I need to go to the money store.

669
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,320
Travis, who's driving this car?

670
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,200
Well, first, Joanna would like to wish her boyfriend Robert a happy belated birthday.

671
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
They've been together four years.

672
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,920
She's a biomedical engineer technologist and he just finished a web page design course.

673
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
He's going to be 24.

674
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
They both love video games.

675
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,640
Oh, he's also a guitarist and they live in Newfoundland, Canada.

676
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,520
So, happy birthday, our neighbors to the north.

677
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Is he a shredder or a plucker?

678
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,480
Does it say?

679
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
He's a shred plucker.

680
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Plucker, shredder.

681
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,840
I bet if you could combine plucker and shredder for long enough, it would be some pretty righteous

682
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,640
profanity.

683
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,680
I was just, it was playing around in my mouth.

684
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,600
I was like, I don't know what I'm going to push out of here.

685
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,640
Shrugger.

686
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
Shrugger.

687
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,680
Newfoundland is, of course, where Great Big C is from.

688
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,480
They're a fine band.

689
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,960
Oh, yes.

690
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah.

691
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,120
So, if you say hi, see them, just say hi.

692
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Jesse Wilson wants to congratulate Jordy Hoyt and Jill Krolik.

693
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,600
Was that good?

694
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
That wasn't very good.

695
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
Krolik?

696
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,400
Growlick.

697
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,960
Growlick.

698
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
Jill Hermione.

699
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,720
They, oh my God, they got married on Saturday.

700
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
Oh, that's a talk.

701
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
Talk about recent.

702
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Jordy is a programmer at Amazon.

703
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Jill's a scientist, and they got cats, and Jill loves squirrels, and Jordy loves beer,

704
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,120
and their cats love when squirrels drink beer.

705
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,600
I made that last one up, but they were roommates originally, and then they fell in love.

706
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah, but they said they started liking each other, but when I read it initially,

707
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,920
it said they started killing each other.

708
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
That's not what happened.

709
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,200
It's like, oh, they have a Mr. and Mrs. Smith thing going on.

710
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
That's adorable.

711
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,240
So, congratulations to Jordy and Jill.

712
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, and got one more.

713
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,760
Tim Harrison is one of Andy Turino's closest friends, and it's his 23rd birthday on July 19th.

714
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
Tim's awesome.

715
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,080
He got a job at ForumSpring.

716
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,560
He introduced Andy to our show, this program, and they're both Maximum Fun donors, which we love,

717
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,040
and it's Tim's birthday, so we love him.

718
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,480
It was Tim's birthday.

719
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
It was Tim's birthday.

720
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,080
We missed it.

721
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,200
By about a week.

722
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,840
Sorry, Tim.

723
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,000
Did my best.

724
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
My best on the program.

725
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,160
When Tim met Andy, it was in primary school.

726
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,920
I don't understand what that means.

727
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,840
Like, you know how wizard school works?

728
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,560
Yeah, okay.

729
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Tim met Andy, and the first words he said to him were,

730
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,760
you have holes in your brain, which I think scared the shit out of Andy.

731
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
Wait, holy shit.

732
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Was that a quantum leap reference?

733
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,480
I hope so.

734
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,600
I hope this friendship is founded on the back of Dr. Samuel Beckett.

735
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Oh, you have Swiss cheese brain.

736
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
You have Swiss cheese memory.

737
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
Oh, with America's treasure, Scott Bakkila.

738
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,720
Thank you.

739
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,480
Thank you, Scott Bakkila.

740
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,440
Thank you, Scott Bakkila.

741
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
Thank you, Money Zone.

742
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Thank you, Andy and Jesse and Joanna.

743
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,960
You guys are the best.

744
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,480
And Scott.

745
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,520
Give us a map, Scott.

746
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,440
Also, a quick, quick correction.

747
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,120
Quick, minor.

748
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
We fucked up last week.

749
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
We goofed it pretty hard.

750
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,320
You may remember the plight of Kim, who was honored in a message by Hayden.

751
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,240
I said that Kim was a speech therapist and also in law school,

752
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,200
and then I commented on how she was doing too many things with her life

753
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,120
and how she needs to settle down, girlfriend.

754
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Turns out that Kim is a speech therapist and Hayden is in law school.

755
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,480
She's just super lazy, I guess, and can only handle one thing at a time.

756
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,040
Yeah, so we're marginally less impressed with her than we were last week.

757
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,800
We are completely comfortable saying when Griffin was wrong.

758
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Yeah, I was super wrong, and I'm so sorry.

759
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,320
And please forgive me.

760
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,600
But hey, onward and upward.

761
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,520
I recently moved-

762
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,720
Hey, wait a second.

763
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:16,960
What?

764
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Ah, motherfucker.

765
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,040
I can't do it.

766
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:33,360
I don't got my geek.

767
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,560
Joanne loves Robert.

768
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,880
Robert loves data and design and web page design.

769
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
Jordy works at Amazon.

770
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,680
Jill is a scientist.

771
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,880
They love their cats, I guess.

772
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,280
Hey Andy, hey Tim, did you fall in love?

773
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,640
You didn't.

774
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,880
You fell in friend.

775
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,280
This song just got bought by John Cougar Mellencamp.

776
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
He said it's like one of his.

777
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
He said Justin, it doesn't rhyme.

778
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,160
Doesn't need to rhyme when it's a poem.

779
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,640
Doesn't need to rhyme when it's about America.

780
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,360
Capturing the American dream.

781
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm sorry, Kim.

782
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,400
And Hayden.

783
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,720
And America.

784
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,200
And John Cougar Mellencamp.

785
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Thanks.

786
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
He listens, you know.

787
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,680
Yeah, he's a big fan.

788
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,720
So I recently moved into a apartment with two other wonderful people and trying to come

789
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,000
up with a name to refer to it as the ranch, the old place, but nothing is really stuck.

790
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,120
My roommate, my roommate and me are getting desperate.

791
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,600
Help us.

792
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
That's from Tom.

793
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,520
I think that the ranch and the old place and like the commune and stuff, that's pretty

794
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:05,920
cool.

795
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,440
But let me pitch this.

796
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
What about like an old timey southern plantation name?

797
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,320
Oh, wow.

798
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Like have you called it like Belle Rouge?

799
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, my God.

800
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,080
I love that.

801
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,320
Listen, none of us.

802
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,080
This is my home La Croix.

803
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,200
In our lifetimes.

804
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,680
The main point here is that the reason for naming a place is that it's easier to lure

805
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,120
members of the opposite sex or same sex, if that's your bag, into it without it sounding

806
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,200
like let me come to the place where I sleep and make duties and showers.

807
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
And I think it's important that this place sounds safe.

808
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:48,960
Safe.

809
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
Do not go with the kill cube.

810
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Whatever you do, avoid the honey trap.

811
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
Welcome to my lair.

812
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
Let's head back to the lair.

813
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
The fortress of bonitude.

814
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
That's bad.

815
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,560
Pussy torture zone is awful.

816
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,360
Don't go with that one.

817
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,920
Yeah.

818
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
Chuck E. Cheese's.

819
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,280
You could keep the government off your tail by calling it something that is already prominent.

820
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
Like if you say the library or something.

821
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,320
Let's see that word.

822
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
Or McDonald's.

823
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
What if you just called it like the church of the divine light?

824
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,800
Oh, shit.

825
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah.

826
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,760
Very clever.

827
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Kids camp.

828
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,960
Kids camp.

829
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,460
Great.

830
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
Come on.

831
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm going to make love to you at kids camp.

832
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,480
What?

833
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,360
That was a Z.

834
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,200
Ooh, call it space camp.

835
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
Everybody wants to go to space camp.

836
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,080
I think space camp is probably the best name.

837
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,920
And then you can make like all kinds of like, and I'm going to take you out of this world.

838
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,480
Yeah.

839
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm about ready to launch.

840
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
Houston, we have a problem.

841
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
All right.

842
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,280
The problem is that I already launched.

843
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,240
That's my bad.

844
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,360
That's on me, Houston.

845
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,600
You could get a console set up like a whole.

846
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,320
Oh, yeah.

847
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,960
Lots of knobs and switches in there.

848
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,760
I love that.

849
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
And then pretend like you're talking to Houston just constantly.

850
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,200
Listen.

851
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
T minus nine, eight, seven.

852
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,560
Yeah, these are all, this is all going to work out super well.

853
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,600
Yeah, this is going to be great.

854
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,560
Listen, NASA has discontinued its shuttle program.

855
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
We got to have somewhere to go from here.

856
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,560
The dream of interplanetary exploration is alive in my bedroom.

857
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:48,480
So come, let us extend our national dream of traveling through the stars as I make a

858
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,960
brief love to you.

859
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,600
And then later I make you something from the kitchen.

860
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Which we call the galley.

861
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,080
We call the galley, technically speaking.

862
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,600
Can we just name the house a person's name and then have it sort of be a character in

863
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,240
their story?

864
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
Like this is Steve the house?

865
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,920
This is Dennis.

866
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
This is my house, Dennis.

867
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,280
It's very spacious.

868
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,920
I live in Houston.

869
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
And then you pretend like it's like haunted and you talk to it and like, Dennis, it's

870
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,480
cold in here.

871
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,440
Wait, is Dennis your butler?

872
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, it's more like a house spirit.

873
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,840
Dennis, your spirit has, your ectoplasm has given me a chill.

874
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,080
How can you ever move, though?

875
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,600
Yeah, you leave Dennis behind.

876
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,480
You gotta burn it down.

877
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,040
Dennis, as with all friendships, when you have to leave one of your friends, you must

878
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,520
kill them.

879
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
If I can't have you, no one can, Dennis.

880
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,040
Is it, was Dennis the name of the house?

881
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,440
I forget.

882
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,960
Dennis is the name of the house.

883
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,840
And it's going to be awkward because every time you walk into or out of the house, it's

884
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,560
like Dennis is either eating you or throwing you up.

885
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
And don't go in the back door.

886
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,680
Hey, hey, listen, I've had a great time talking with you tonight.

887
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
Uh, I'd like this to continue.

888
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,520
Do you want to crawl inside my friend Dennis' mouth and have sex?

889
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,840
Can we go in and out of the back door repeatedly and have sex with our house Dennis?

890
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
For Dennis sake.

891
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,320
Why are you trying to have sex with the house Dennis?

892
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,280
Why can't, why can't we not just at once have a question that's about houses that have

893
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,560
names?

894
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,040
Yeah, like, why does it always have to have to turn into a pornographic?

895
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,000
Have you guys ever seen the movie Monster House?

896
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,720
It'd be like that.

897
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,720
It wouldn't though.

898
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,000
I mean, if you think about it, it wouldn't be like that at all.

899
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,600
Have you guys ever seen the movie, um, the Money Trap starring Tom Hanks?

900
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,280
You're thinking of the Honey Trap.

901
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,680
The Money Pit, you mean?

902
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,280
The Money Trap Pit.

903
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,600
The Money Pit Pit.

904
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,080
Are you thinking they should name the house the Money Pit?

905
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,000
Can they name it Scott Bakkila?

906
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Can they name the house Scott Bakkila?

907
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,040
This is my house.

908
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,240
America's, America's Treasurer Scott Bakkila.

909
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,320
America's Treasurer Scott Bakkila.

910
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,360
I live in him.

911
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,840
I live inside Scott Bakkila.

912
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Can we take it to the next level?

913
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,600
Okay.

914
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,680
Can, can the three of you, assuming you're not on a long lease that you would be penalized

915
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,720
for leaving, can you just go live inside of Scott Bakkila?

916
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
Like inner space style?

917
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,520
Like inner space style.

918
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,800
Live in his guts.

919
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,000
Are you saying they need to invent shrinking technology technology?

920
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Where do you live?

921
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Just send that letter straight to Scott.

922
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,120
Uh, just PO box, Scott, and, uh, I've attached some notes and stuff to his eyeballs so I

923
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,160
can read it too.

924
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,000
Wait, don't read my mail, Scott.

925
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,000
That's weird.

926
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,280
All these letters just keep getting mailed to me, but it just says Scott Bakkila.

927
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
To me, but it just says Scott on it.

928
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,400
Oh, that's mine.

929
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,920
Just eat the letter.

930
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,400
I'll get it.

931
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,920
If I could control Scott Bakkila's body from the inside, starting inner space, quantum

932
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,360
leap to day one.

933
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,920
You guys don't even know.

934
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,560
Leaped again.

935
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,480
You're right.

936
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,960
Oh boy.

937
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
Here I go again.

938
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,320
So you-

939
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,440
There are tiny people in my body making me make this poor decision.

940
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Basically, Scott Bakkila's manager would get a call and he said, hi, is this a manager?

941
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,240
Yes.

942
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,400
This is definitely Scott Bakkila.

943
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,720
These are definitely aren't people inside of Scott Bakkila.

944
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
So wait, wait, wait.

945
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,440
This is gone from living in Scott Bakkila to controlling it like Meet Dave style.

946
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,720
Like you're inside Scott Bakkila's head piloting.

947
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,280
That's where we're at, Travis.

948
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,600
Keep up.

949
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,080
Exactly.

950
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
That's exactly the situation.

951
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,680
Can you put me on a TV show?

952
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,160
What kind?

953
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,320
Quantum leap is pretty good.

954
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,360
You know how we've been itching to start on quantum leap to the sequel to a TV show?

955
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
That thing that, of course, people do all the time?

956
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
If they're bringing back Dallas, can't they bring back-

957
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm willing to bet they wouldn't call it quantum leap 2.

958
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,680
I think they could just call it quantum leap.

959
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
Quantum leap colon some more.

960
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,040
As everyone knows, he took a brief sabbatical and never returned home.

961
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,320
He's still out there leaping.

962
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,640
He is.

963
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
That show had a very ambiguous ending.

964
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
I'm saying it's up to us to shrink ourselves,

965
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,640
lip and Scott Bakkila's body and control him to create quantum leap 2.

966
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,280
Still leaping.

967
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,600
Leaped again.

968
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,560
How much money?

969
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,640
How much dollar do you want me to push for, Scott?

970
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,000
Just the regular amount.

971
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
However much I normally get from shows.

972
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,080
Can we three times that money?

973
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,480
Can we triple it and then split it with your-

974
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,440
And then shrink it.

975
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
I got a lot of mini mouths to feed.

976
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,800
I have mini mouths to feed.

977
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,320
I mean, by which I mean tiny mouths that live inside me.

978
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,240
Can we make Scott Bakkila giant?

979
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
Seriously, not shrink down.

980
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
We just blow up Scott Bakkila.

981
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,640
Oh, my God.

982
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,400
You guys have just set up a reality where we can have a battle between

983
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,520
giant Scott Bakkila and giant gonorrhea.

984
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,240
Waging a war.

985
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
Laser shooting out of his eyes.

986
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,080
He's leaping.

987
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,880
Although I don't know why he would have laser technology.

988
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,640
He's just big Scott Bakkila.

989
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,600
Well, you know, bigger.

990
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,000
Why not?

991
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,720
I mean, if you're going to shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

992
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:34,960
Yeah.

993
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,920
Yeah, don't limit yourself here.

994
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,880
We got to dream big.

995
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,880
So we're all going to go to Scott Bakkila, get inside him at once.

996
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,600
And what if we just gave Scott Bakkila the antibodies to fight gonorrhea,

997
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,240
and then it would just live and you would live inside him and be cured.

998
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,520
Oh, OK.

999
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,720
So he's like an incubator.

1000
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,640
He's like a water slide is what you're saying.

1001
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,760
Like every every person on Earth would have to go through Scott Bakkila's body

1002
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,600
and then they would be free of diseases.

1003
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,120
I don't understand what you're saying.

1004
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,280
Yeah, Scott Bakkila needs to eat everybody.

1005
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,040
That's what I'm telling you.

1006
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
Giant Scott Bakkila, not regular Scott Bakkila.

1007
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,360
So to answer your question about what to name your apartment,

1008
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,840
Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

1009
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,680
Glad that we can help with that one.

1010
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,840
No, giant Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

1011
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,160
Sorry, I meant to say giant Scott Bakkila.

1012
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,680
If if regular Scott Bakkila eats people, he's he's ham-electar.

1013
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,360
Oh, and so then so he absorbs all the gonorrhea

1014
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,720
and then flies into space and explodes, saving everyone on Earth.

1015
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,080
But sacrificing himself.

1016
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,320
This rain is really weird.

1017
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,200
It smells like Scott Bakkila and gonorrhea in rain form.

1018
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,200
Why did we come out today?

1019
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,520
Let's stop this game of catch.

1020
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,480
I'm over it.

1021
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,640
Let's do a Yahoo.

1022
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,040
All right.

1023
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,640
This one was sent in by Joseph Hennessy.

1024
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ryan who asks,

1025
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,120
how can I successfully become a creepy person?

1026
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
Hi, I would like to become a creepy person,

1027
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,720
not just to the eyes of one other, but for everybody.

1028
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,840
What procedures should I follow in order to become an ephetis creepy person?

1029
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,160
Thanks.

1030
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,360
What?

1031
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,880
Excuse me?

1032
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,040
I feel like getting on Yahoo Answers is a good first step in the right direction.

1033
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,640
You are fucking halfway there.

1034
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,280
Are you kidding me?

1035
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,520
I think that beginning your Yahoo Answers question with hello

1036
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,920
is a good step to hello, internet.

1037
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,160
Hi.

1038
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,840
I know one in particular.

1039
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:26,800
It's me.

1040
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,680
Talk like that.

1041
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,400
That's good.

1042
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,680
There's the best answer.

1043
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,800
I was voted by Yahoo Answers users.

1044
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,040
Their username is just period.

1045
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,240
It's just one period.

1046
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,320
And they said, never frown, even when you're sad,

1047
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,800
because you never know who's falling in love with your smile.

1048
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,440
So basically just do that.

1049
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,560
Like basically just do what that person just did and said to you.

1050
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,960
Say those things to people.

1051
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,240
In that exact order.

1052
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,240
The secret to being a creep is to imagine a reality

1053
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,560
in which Paul Giamatti has no acting talent.

1054
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,320
And if you can act like that, like Paul Giamatti,

1055
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,200
but without the redeeming quality of his wonderful acting,

1056
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,320
that to me is the quintessential creep.

1057
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,040
A second.

1058
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,560
I thought that you were just saying if you want to be a creepy person-

1059
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,120
The attitude that someone would have if Paul Giamatti didn't have any acting ability.

1060
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah, like Paul Giamatti had never acted.

1061
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,000
Paul Giamatti sucks at acting.

1062
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh, that guy's, you're such a creep for saying that.

1063
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
I thought that that was what you were saying at first.

1064
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,320
No, no.

1065
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,040
You know who I hate?

1066
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,920
Paul Giamatti.

1067
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,880
Ew, get out of here.

1068
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,560
Get out of here, you creep.

1069
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,440
Oh, I thought you were talking like an alternate reality kind of circumstance

1070
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,240
where if we lived in a world where Paul Giamatti didn't have any acting ability-

1071
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh shit, or he just never tried it.

1072
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,960
Yeah.

1073
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
That's fucking, that's fucking F1.

1074
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,800
Listen, giant Sam Beckett, Paul Giamatti is never gonna act.

1075
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
You've got to convince him to go to the audition.

1076
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,320
And then-

1077
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,920
Oh, boy.

1078
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,880
Oh, God.

1079
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,280
Sorry.

1080
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,720
Let's stop the show.

1081
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,360
My, here's the thing.

1082
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,040
If you ever see me in person, just walk up to me and say Giant's Calvacula.

1083
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,440
And I'll just start, I promise you I will always find that idea entertaining.

1084
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,040
You know what the worst part about doing this show is?

1085
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,640
I'm gonna have to walk out my office door and I'm gonna walk in a world where there

1086
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,320
isn't a Giant's Calvacula.

1087
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,680
And here in this sphere-

1088
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,160
Can we stay in this dreamscape forever?

1089
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,560
Well, listen, thank you for coming into this dreamscape with us.

1090
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,520
We're so happy to have you and so happy that you guys have stuck with us.

1091
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,600
If you get a second, tell somebody you know, say, hey, listen, this show is gonna start slow.

1092
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,640
And then at the end, it's gonna really go on a journey.

1093
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,760
So I need you to go on it with me because I can't do this alone, I'm afraid.

1094
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,400
And share the show.

1095
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,360
Share the show with somebody you care about.

1096
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,800
If you know Scott Baccala, can you try and get him on board?

1097
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Because I feel like we had some pretty good ideas for him.

1098
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,560
Career-wise.

1099
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,640
Some real advances we want to make to his career.

1100
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,680
I think we're really gonna turn this whole thing around.

1101
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,080
We're really gonna blow him up and then we're gonna blow him up.

1102
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,680
And then we're gonna blow up his cell because everybody wants a piece of him and they can.

1103
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,240
He's large enough that I can get a sliver.

1104
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,800
This is my chunk of the Berlin Wall and this is my chunk of Scott Baccala that I took.

1105
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,640
This is my glowing piece of that radical rock.

1106
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,720
This is my piece of the agrocrack.

1107
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,400
Your mantle's fucking weird, man.

1108
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,720
It's a weird mantle, dude.

1109
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,400
Got some weird-ass tchotchkes up in here.

1110
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,160
If you go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron, you can do just like Joanna and

1111
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,480
Jesse and Andy did and say something to a friend.

1112
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,920
Corporations, if you got a business you want us to plug, we do that too.

1113
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,520
We got forums.

1114
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,600
It's also at maximumfun.org as long as you're there.

1115
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,320
Go check it out.

1116
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,080
If you want to send us a question or a Yahoo question, our email is nbmbam at gmail.com.

1117
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,360
You can just shoot us one there.

1118
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,280
Or nbmbam at maximumfun.org.

1119
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,520
Yes.

1120
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,800
Either one works.

1121
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,760
Thank you so much to John Roderick and the Long Winners for letting us use the song

1122
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,000
It's a Departure as our theme song.

1123
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,600
It's on the album Putting the Days to Bed, which no joke is a fucking phenomenal album.

1124
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,320
Say thanks to John Roderick is just at John Roderick on Twitter.

1125
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,360
So say thanks to him.

1126
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,080
Say, hey, hey, you rock really good.

1127
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,000
You walk so right.

1128
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,960
I see on here that Isolated in Indianapolis owes us a cheesecake.

1129
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,080
Is this accurate?

1130
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,320
Yeah.

1131
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,120
She let us know that, you know, we talked last week directly to her boyfriend and told

1132
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,080
him to move.

1133
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,960
And then she, I think, made the mistake of listening to the episode with him.

1134
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,040
And now he is moving to Indianapolis to be with her.

1135
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,400
And she informed us that her cheesecakes are, in fact, amazing.

1136
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,280
So in my opinion, she owes us, but more specifically me, a cheesecake.

1137
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
The good news is we helped save this relationship.

1138
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,760
The bad news is that someone did one of the things we told them to do.

1139
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,160
Yes.

1140
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,920
Which we cannot stress enough.

1141
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,360
You really should not do that.

1142
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,080
Don't ever do that.

1143
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,360
Unless you are Scott Bakkila.

1144
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,320
Speaking of which, thanks to Bob Ball, who does our intro.

1145
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,640
Thank you, Bob.

1146
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,040
We love him.

1147
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,440
I went to Red Lobster with Bob this week.

1148
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,240
What'd you get?

1149
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,720
Cheese rolls?

1150
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:28,960
What?

1151
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,080
Did you get some of those cheese rolls?

1152
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,120
Did you win the shrimp?

1153
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,440
What did you eat?

1154
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,400
Did you win the shrimp?

1155
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,520
A day with a Red Lobster visit without Cheddar Bay.

1156
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,080
What's the point?

1157
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,680
Are we talking scampi?

1158
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,120
Are we talking fried coconut?

1159
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,200
I did a little bit of both, you know.

1160
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,480
So thanks to everybody.

1161
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,240
We love it when you tweet about the show on Twitter,

1162
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,560
which seems like the best place to put tweets.

1163
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,960
Just use the M-E-M-E-A-M hashtag.

1164
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,520
The best thing about it is when people don't tweet anything about the show,

1165
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,120
just something that's going on in their life,

1166
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,680
and then put the M-E-M-E-A-M hashtag for some reason.

1167
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,640
I like that, though.

1168
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,440
I like that.

1169
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,200
Just keep it going.

1170
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,080
Share the show with people.

1171
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,600
And hey, if you're telling somebody about it,

1172
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,320
or if you're tweeting about it, put out a link to our sampler.

1173
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,200
It's bit.ly forward slash itsmabimbam.

1174
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,040
So do that.

1175
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,760
Thank you, everybody.

1176
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:20,960
Thanks.

1177
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,520
Thanks.

1178
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:21,840
Thanks.

1179
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,400
We love you.

1180
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,880
Griffin.

1181
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,520
This is finally Yahoo!

1182
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,880
was sent in by Ghaliayali.

1183
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,880
This is finally Yahoo! was sent in by Ghaliayali.

1184
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,760
Thank you, Ghali.

1185
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,400
It's by Yahoo!

1186
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,080
answers user question mark, who asks,

1187
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,160
did you ever guest star on The Golden Girls?

1188
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,640
I'm Justin McElroy.

1189
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,920
I'm Travis McElroy.

1190
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1191
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1192
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,960
Kiss your dad.

1193
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,200
Sqeeear the lips.

1194
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,080
Keep your heart.

1195
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,960
Three stacks.

1196
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,000
Keep your heart.

1197
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,280
Hey, keep your heart.

1198
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,160
Three stacks.

1199
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,200
Keep your heart.

1200
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,480
Man, these girls are smart.

1201
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,120
Three stacks.

1202
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,240
These girls are smart.

1203
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:24,240
Keep your heart.
