1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,040
So we come in with me playing, I can go get Rachel's flute and we can do a pay a piper thing.

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
If you know how to play it at all. No, I think it's better if he doesn't.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah, this is a good idea, Griffin. This is a great idea.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't want to go find Rachel's flute. Oh, come on, that's such a good idea.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
I'll play it like this. Okay, do it, go.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,880
There it is.

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:22,960
What is going on?

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,760
That's a, she's a, she's a shrill on that one, that flute.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,120
So it's the maximum fun drive is now. Did you already say the thing about paying the piper?

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,440
No, I haven't done that.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
So this is a show that you pay money for to make it better like it is now.

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
If you can believe it.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
If you could even believe that.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,720
You're probably thinking, how could this get any better?

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,080
And so I'm Griffin and there's Justin and Travis. What are we, what the fuck are we doing?

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,240
This is the one time a year where we say, we try to put on our good suits

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,440
and we stand in front of the church and we ask for money for the, you know, the big operation.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,720
Do you hear that noise?

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
In the back, that's the piper.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
There we go.

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,240
And they're playing for you.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean, technically speaking, that's Elizabeth Whitland and playing a flute solo.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
But, but, India Major.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,800
But really the thing is that it's max fun drive time again, folks.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,520
And that means that it's the piper and it's time to pay for all those great hours of entertainment

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,640
that you have enjoyed.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm going to begin potting Ms. Whitland down a little bit.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,960
Yeah, go ahead.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
Thank you, yes, yes, yes.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Here's the deal.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
Real quick, let me lay it out.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
So maximumfun.org is a donor supported network.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
That means that once a year we come to you and we say, hey,

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,800
do you love the shows that are on maximumfun.org?

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,320
Maybe consider committing to a monthly donation by going to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,080
And when you do, you're going to get some rewards and we'll talk more about this later.

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
But the one thing I wanted to tell you about is in the rewards starting at the five dollar

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
and included in every level is the bonus content.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,440
And it's like 100 plus hours at this point because it's not just this year's bonus content.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,600
It's every year's bonus content.

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,440
And this year we did commentary for episode three of the My Brother, My Brother and Me TV show.

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,640
And our amazing and much funnier than us wives did another episode of My Sister-in-law,

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,320
My Sister-in-law and Me.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
There's an episode.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Worst title since My Brother, My Brother and Me.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,760
That's right.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,920
And we on Adventure Zone played Game of Honey Heist where I DMed and Griffin and Dad and Justin

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
are bears trying to steal some honey.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Yes, there's there's a lot of great content and we're going to dive more into what the

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
drive is all about as we move on.

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
But but, you know, start getting, you know, start flexing that wallet.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,840
Get it limber.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,440
Yeah, start getting wet for donating.

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,000
All right.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Justin, you want to do a question?

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,480
I would love that.

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,640
Or you want to dig around for a bassoon solo on the Internet for 45 minutes?

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
Maybe a sousaphone.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
What's funny about bassoon solos, Griffin?

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
I don't understand why I would go after a bassoon solo.

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
That's not a Piper thing.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Well, nothing was funny about a flute solo.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,880
It would have been funny if you guys had fucking like leaned into it and done.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
The problem is we started talking 20 minutes before you started playing.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
There was no clear delineation of where this episode started.

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah.

72
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Well, I was just trying to find the music and you guys are like, I guess this is a show now.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
I guess we're doing a show.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
We're all trying to find the music.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
In our hearts.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm trying to find the music right now.

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
The absolute mad.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
The absolute mad lad.

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
The fucking mad lad.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,640
This is funnier.

81
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
Yeah, that's a funny woodwind right there.

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,440
You got me.

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
Bassoons are weird.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
I didn't even know bassoons could do that.

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,600
Last week, my coworker and I were discussing pets and I mentioned that I was hoping to

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
upgrade my beta fish to a bigger tank once I saved enough money to do so.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,920
Pointless.

88
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
She then told me not to get a tank since she had one she could give me to me.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,120
Obviously, I happily accepted this since it would be free as opposed to the alternative.

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,520
Yes.

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Thank you.

92
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
Today, she showed up at my house with the tank, all its accessories and the fish that

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
were apparently still using it as a residence.

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,720
Oh, no.

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I was never told about these fish.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,480
I can't just add my beta with them since betas are extremely territorial and kill most other

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,120
fish.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
Do I ask her to take the fish back if she doesn't have a tank to keep them in or am

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
I stuck with the responsibility of owning fish and never wanted the first place?

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
That's from Aquatically Challenged in Albertville.

101
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,320
This is a terrible situation you find yourself in.

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,960
I'm very sorry.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,400
Also, hey, it was very nice of your coworker to give you a free tank or whatever, I guess,

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,960
but it's hard for me to condone any pet owner that's like, oh, you want?

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay, great.

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
That's like if I said, oh, you need a new crate for your dog?

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,840
Cool.

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Here's my crate with my dog in it.

109
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,040
Bye.

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,560
This is unprecedented.

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
I don't think you need to feel bad about confronting this person because this is a wild twist and

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
turn that they've sent you spiraling down.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,240
The reason I said pointless, I interjected that, is because I already knew betas were

114
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
very territorial.

115
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
You have to have a beta by itself.

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,240
You can't even have, I've heard, you can't even have a mirror next to a beta tank because

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
it'll exhaust itself to death trying to beat its own ass.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
This is something that I've heard that I believe is true.

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Hold on, that's true of me too if I'm in front of a mirror.

120
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,200
Right.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,160
He'll try to fight himself.

122
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
So I said it was pointless.

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,720
I don't think fish care, right?

124
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
Like a fish, fish are in bags a lot of the time.

125
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
One thing I don't think a fish has ever said is, ugh, this sucks.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
Like I think fish are just like, it's fine.

127
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
A fish in a bag, I'm like, well, I'm in a bag.

128
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
That's the way it goes, I guess.

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
If you get a bigger tank, the fish isn't like, ah, more room for furniture.

130
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,760
Right.

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
He doesn't care.

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,000
The only reason to get a bigger tank is to put more fish in it, right?

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,760
He forgets, the fish forgets the other end of the tank by the time it gets to it.

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,960
It gets to, it swims to the other end and it's like, oh, hell yeah, look back there.

135
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,200
A whole other part of the tank I've yet to go to.

136
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,040
When we were growing up, we had a fish tank and our dad put that like a sticky-

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
I still think this story is apocryphal.

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, we'll get to that in a second.

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,840
But he put this like thing on the back that was like just a picture of like undersea kelp

140
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
or whatever, I guess, that you like stuck to the back of the tank

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,400
as if the fish was like, oh, now I'm back in the ocean.

142
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
Oh, kelp, sick.

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,840
But also we kept the fish tank in the back room of our house,

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
which was, I guess, poorly insulated and not heated.

145
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,480
And one very cold winter, it froze solid.

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,760
So dad took it to his office to thaw so he could get new fish.

147
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,720
And when it thawed, dad claims all the fish were fine.

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
Lies, lies, lies from our dad.

149
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,600
And then he said they started to run and play just like they were young again.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah, sure.

151
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
I have two solutions for this that I think are both equally amazing.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,200
And one is to arm the other fish.

153
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,000
Arm the other fish with knife and pipe and gun.

154
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
Small ones, obviously.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,240
And maybe, you know, let's see, a candlestick, a revolver.

156
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Poison, if you want to.

157
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,640
And then the beta will not have a weapon, but is a weapon.

158
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,800
So there will be a little bit more equal grounds there, I feel like.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,960
And maybe it'll be like a mutually assured destruction thing

160
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,240
and they'll leave each other alone.

161
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,520
And the other solution is you still have the other original tank,

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,480
the original small tank.

163
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,160
So you scoop up the other fish

164
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,080
and you do a little, you know, prince and popper swapper-oo.

165
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,240
And, you know, the ones, these fish that were swimming in this big ass tank

166
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,680
living the high life now have to trade places with your beta.

167
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,960
And then they'll learn a little bit about each other's, you know, shoes

168
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,040
and the walks of life that they have to go on.

169
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,440
And they will just die of natural causes

170
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
before they can do anything useful with that information.

171
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah.

172
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
Might I recommend maybe you put them in that smaller tank

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
and then you move that across the room.

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
Still in the line of sight of the beta,

175
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,280
but far enough away that the beta won't try to attack.

176
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,400
And then every day you move that tank one inch closer

177
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,040
and then maybe in like six years, you jump them in.

178
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
Oh.

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
If my experience with fish is any indicator,

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,400
one thing you could try is wait just a little bit,

181
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
like a month or so.

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
And the problem will just sort of like sort itself out.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
You don't even need to starve them out.

184
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
You can treat them like super good

185
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
and really super, really, really super duper hope they don't die

186
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,320
because your daughter doesn't even understand what death is.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
You could really wish them to do it to live

188
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
and try your best to make them live and they won't.

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
They'll probably bathe it.

190
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
You could also, following up on Griffin's thing,

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
scoop those other fish into the smaller bowl

192
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,400
and then take it back to work and hand it to your coworker

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,080
and say, hey, here's your fucking family members you gave me.

194
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,120
Weirdo.

195
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Here's the animals that you are supposed to be responsible for.

196
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,640
Hey, I've got some baby clothes.

197
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
I know you're having a baby.

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Do you want some of these old baby clothes?

199
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay, cool.

200
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
My baby's in it.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,440
Fuck you.

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
For sale baby shoes, never worn.

203
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,760
Yeah, I'll take them.

204
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,120
What the fuck?

205
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
There is a baby in this.

206
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,520
Rubble rubble.

207
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
You got me again.

208
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
Me again.

209
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
Hey, I got a butt plug.

210
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Wait, your butt's on it.

211
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
Wait a second.

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,040
Hey, asshole.

213
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,400
Can I do a Yahoo?

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,720
Yes.

215
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,200
I like that, Griff.

216
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
I love that butt.

217
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
It was sent in by Brendan.

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,000
Thanks, Brendan.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

220
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,840
They're anonymous.

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
I'll call him Murphy Asks.

222
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Why are tricycles only designed for little kids?

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Yes.

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
Tricycles are a great invention and they should be used by commuting adults

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
and in sports too.

226
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
I don't understand why they are only designed for children

227
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
because the ones I saw in the store are all pink and two feet high.

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
And for sports.

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,760
I didn't even think about that.

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,280
Didn't think about sports.

231
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
Oh, Boise.

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Can you imagine lacrosse with tricycles or football with tricycles?

233
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
Loving that.

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,040
Loving it all.

235
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
Swimming with tricycles.

236
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,360
How would you do the kicks?

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
You would have a foot glued to the tricycle.

238
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,120
Hell yeah.

239
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,400
Now you're cooking.

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,840
You fucking Rube Goldberg machine brain heaven motherfucker.

241
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,320
I love it.

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,880
I love it.

243
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,320
There's a Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Answers user named Mark.

244
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,960
Sorry, what?

245
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,800
So tired.

246
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
Yes, Yahoo Answers user named Mark who says,

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah, this is a be all over Yahoo.

248
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Mark says, they're like scooters with training wheels and safer.

249
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I guess they are though.

250
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
That's pretty dope.

251
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,440
So I mean, there are those things that you can kind of like prop your knee up on and

252
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,640
kind of push yourself along on.

253
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,840
Those are, I think that is a three wheeled means of conveyance.

254
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,920
There are some three wheeled means of conveyance.

255
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,040
I don't mean to say that there aren't, but the tricycle, the brand tricycle,

256
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
I don't think we're using as adults.

257
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Especially, I would say power wheels for adults.

258
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
This is a thing.

259
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
That's a four wheeled vehicle.

260
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
No, what am I thinking of?

261
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,040
Big wheels.

262
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,800
Big wheels for adults.

263
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
That's what I want.

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,400
Did they ever make big power wheels?

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,240
You know, a vehicle you can get in and drive around, but for adults.

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,800
A motorized three wheeled big boy tricycle for big adults like me, but I would do mine

267
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
up so it looked like the motorcycle in Akira.

268
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,920
Can you fucking imagine me just like doing a brake slide into the parking lot of the

269
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
Target in my sick ass big monster wheel power boy?

270
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,360
Now they do have three wheeled motorcycles, but I've always thought that if I tried

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,040
to roll up to like a super cool biker bar in one of those, they would not accept me

272
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
as one of their own.

273
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
And that's so important.

274
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
All we want is acceptance in this life.

275
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,360
Right?

276
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
They would let me, listen, they'd let me in and I would be allowed to hang out there,

277
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
but I'd never really feel like I was actually part of the gang.

278
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
They'd let me in, but when they were planning events or whatever, they would forget to call

279
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,080
me, but if I was there, they'd let me in.

280
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,640
You know what I mean?

281
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,560
But like, I would always be on the outside looking in.

282
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
You roll up at those big power wheels.

283
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Now you're a son of anarchy.

284
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,280
Oh, yes I am.

285
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,800
I might be the dad of anarchy.

286
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Is that a bad thing?

287
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
Is that a good thing or bad thing?

288
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
I did not see the show.

289
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
To be a dad of anarchy or a son?

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's any family member of anarchy.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
I imagine they got up to some pretty nice people and shit.

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
I would not want to be a family member of anarchy because it would make planning events

293
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,920
really hard.

294
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,480
That's true.

295
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Some of them were bad, but some of them were nice.

296
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,760
Is this sort of the short version?

297
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,720
Whoa, okay.

298
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,200
Whoa.

299
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,760
And I bet that's where a lot of the conflict came from.

300
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah, that is actually, thank you.

301
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,480
Yes, Travis.

302
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Okay.

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Did they ever hurt each other with like weapons and stuff?

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
Like badass fights?

305
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,280
Like was there a part where one was like-

306
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,440
Do you want me to summarize the events of the first seasons of Sons of Anarchy?

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
No, no.

308
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,280
The whole show, please.

309
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, the whole show.

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
And I want to know how many badass weapon fights they did.

311
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
So there, they definitely, there was definitely shooting.

312
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay.

313
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
And I think they probably fought with fists a lot.

314
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,960
What?

315
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,480
Did they use bow and arrows or guns?

316
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Guns.

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Yes, guns.

318
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Thank you.

319
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,280
Yes.

320
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
And there was a lot of bad looks, you know what I mean?

321
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
That can cut the deepest, you know?

322
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
Yeah, for sure.

323
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,480
There were some harsh words said.

324
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
I thought that bike fights were only supposed to happen with chains.

325
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
I guess I'm going off road rash and that's not an accurate,

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,800
I guess it's not a historical look at the sort of bike life was road rash.

327
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,960
Can we do another question though?

328
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,920
My boss keeps asking me if I want to buy tickets

329
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,320
to go see his amateur production of My Fair Lady.

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,840
How do I decline politely?

331
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
He has handed out the flyer to me twice already.

332
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
That's from not so fair a lady in Newcastle.

333
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,280
Okay.

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Maybe try like when next time your boss does say like,

335
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,640
oh, I've already seen it.

336
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
Yeah, thank you.

337
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,360
That would be a great excuse if you could use it for any community

338
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
or local theater production.

339
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Just be like, oh, you're doing Godspell?

340
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,760
I seen it already.

341
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,200
I've already seen My Fair Lady at the end.

342
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,960
She does learn to talk good.

343
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,080
I wish I hadn't seen it already.

344
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,280
That was so thoughtless of me

345
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
because I read Pygmalion when I was fucking 12.

346
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
And I know all the different things in it and all the jokes and stuff.

347
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,480
All she wants is a room somewhere and then she gets it.

348
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,400
No, you see our production is special because it does.

349
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh, did you change it and now she doesn't learn to talk good?

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,960
No, it's still very much.

351
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,800
Oh yeah, I know that version.

352
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
He likes her face or whatever.

353
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,280
Shoot.

354
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,080
I think you could probably just tell them that Justin hates My Fair Lady

355
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,720
and that would be enough to sort of wave it off.

356
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,640
That tells them everything they need to know.

357
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,520
I would love to, but I took a pledge to Justin McElroy

358
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
that I wouldn't support My Fair Lady.

359
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,120
Sorry, it stinks on ice.

360
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
You hear that, Eliza Doolittle?

361
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
Justin's coming for you.

362
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
Maybe if someone says, hey, do you want to go see My Fair Lady?

363
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
You can say, I can't, I have a fucking cribbage game that day

364
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
because I'm 80 years old, apparently.

365
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,680
No, wait, that's right.

366
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm not 80 years old, so no, I will not see My Fair Lady.

367
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,920
Or just say, I don't have to go to community theater

368
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
because I'm not related to you.

369
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,840
Because I think contractually,

370
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,880
that's the only time you have to go to community theater.

371
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
So your boss comes to you and they say,

372
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Philip, I would really appreciate it

373
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,240
if you care to see my production of My Fair Lady

374
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
and you look at your boss and go, dad?

375
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,240
What do you mean?

376
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,080
Are you my dad?

377
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,640
No, I don't know why you would think that.

378
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Well, why the fuck else would I go see that old ass whack shit?

379
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,080
Do something good.

380
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah, ask him, ask him, say, I'd love to.

381
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
I'd love to get out and consume the arts

382
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,600
and support your work.

383
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Can you guys do a different show, though?

384
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,720
Can you do a different one?

385
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,840
Learn a new one.

386
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,560
Do Seussical, Seussical's fun.

387
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,320
Everyone loves it, it's fun songs.

388
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Bright colors.

389
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not saying I don't support community theater.

390
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
I just don't support My Fair Lady.

391
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
It's all about a man trying to change a woman.

392
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
Fuck My Fair Lady.

393
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,360
Hey, here's one for you.

394
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Starlight Express, they're all on roller skates.

395
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,800
Are you kidding me?

396
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

397
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,880
A musical about a bunch of people that are a train?

398
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
If you want to do a show, that's a show.

399
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
Fuck yeah.

400
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,400
Do it in the round, are you kidding me with this?

401
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
Do Equus.

402
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
I'll go see Equus.

403
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
What about your town?

404
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
That's the ones about piss.

405
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,180
Yeah.

406
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,200
Have you seen the Piss Show, boss?

407
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Have you seen it?

408
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
It's fun.

409
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,000
It's fun.

410
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
And it hasn't been done a bajillion times.

411
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,560
Do you know about Muppets?

412
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,000
What if they said fuck?

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Avenue Q, go see it.

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
You think you know the Founding Fathers, but guess what?

415
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
These ones rap.

416
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,120
These ones do rap.

417
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
What if they rap?

418
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
What if they rap, though?

419
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,840
Go do a good one that nobody hates, like me.

420
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Go see a good theater.

421
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,440
Well, make a good theater.

422
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Make a good theater.

423
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
Show up at the theater with your money,

424
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
and they say it will cost you $15 to see My Fair Lady.

425
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,360
And you just ask, what else is showing tonight?

426
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
I'd like to see my boss in a different musical, please.

427
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,200
I'd love to.

428
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
What's playing in the black box?

429
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
Can you tell me now?

430
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,040
What's your experimental show?

431
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,040
The Curious Case of the Dog of the Night-Time, perhaps?

432
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,080
I'll make you a deal.

433
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
I wanna support you.

434
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
I wanna support what you're doing.

435
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
So here's what I'm gonna do.

436
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm gonna buy a ticket to go see your show,

437
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
and then I'm gonna use that ticket to go see Captain Marvel.

438
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,960
You will know that it is in your name,

439
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
and I've already supported you,

440
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,200
but I will be going to see the latest from Mr. Marvel

441
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,280
and his incredible inventions.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
I've both agreed to support you and Jim Marvel,

443
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,600
and I've just known Jim longer, so I think I'm good.

444
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
I wanna see the latest confection

445
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
from the Mighty Marvel Power Rangers and all of their folks,

446
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,160
and I will-

447
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,560
I have to find out what happened with Thanos or whatever.

448
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,680
Your dusty, rot-ridden, steamer trunk of a production

449
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
sucks so hard and doesn't even have one fucking mutant in it.

450
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
I don't say fuck at all.

451
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,240
If you do a R-rated My Fair Lady, maybe I'm in.

452
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
You're fucking raiding Spain for spending the fucking planes.

453
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
Isn't it?

454
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
Isn't it, guys?

455
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
Griffin, I didn't know you were into grime.

456
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,040
Oh, man.

457
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,840
Can you guys do Benjamin Button?

458
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,600
Did they make a play of that yet?

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,240
Definitely.

460
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,720
Do a play of the Button Man.

461
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,000
Curious Jam of Button Man.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah.

463
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Love it, love it.

464
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,800
Griffin, how would you guys feel about Yahoo?

465
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,400
Because that would go down pretty smooth for me.

466
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Or should we-

467
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,680
I think we should do a Max Fun Drive segment.

468
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,920
Yeah, let's do it.

469
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,280
Yeah, let's talk about our charge here, our cause,

470
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
the reason we were put on this Earth.

471
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,600
The reason for the season.

472
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,480
The reason for the season.

473
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
It's Max Fun Drive time.

474
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
We've been a part of the network now.

475
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,200
This is our eighth Max Fun Drive, I believe, which is-

476
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,760
Oh, boy.

477
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
It's really, really wild.

478
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,040
And every year, you all have come out to support us.

479
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,520
And your support has been immeasurable and remarkable

480
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
and has changed our lives and allowed us to turn this

481
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,920
into our full-time jobs.

482
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,800
And so when you donate, you get to pick directly

483
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,720
where your money goes to, which shows

484
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,800
you want to support directly.

485
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,120
And so, yeah, it is a very direct way to help out

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,040
the people who make things that you like,

487
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,840
whether it's us or whoever else at Max Fun.

488
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
We love being a part of the network

489
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,880
and get really excited to tell you about this thing

490
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,840
they do every year.

491
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
Also, you should get excited because you can get

492
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,320
some dope shit.

493
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,920
Like, and then you guys jump in and you start talking about-

494
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, the number one thing that you get,

495
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and listen, there's some material goods you get too,

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,120
but I sincerely believe the bonus content is the best.

497
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
Like, there's video stuff in there.

498
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
There's us, like, riffing on old school,

499
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,480
like, educational films.

500
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
God, we made that, like, six years ago now.

501
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
We made that so long ago.

502
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
I know, and it's still there.

503
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
You get bonus episodes of content

504
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

505
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,560
We have, last year for the Adventure Zone,

506
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,520
there's us playing four Sherlock Holmeses

507
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,560
and a vampire who is one of the aforementioned

508
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,160
Sherlock Holmeses, I think is the-

509
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,120
Which is real good.

510
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,040
I think one of the silliest things we've ever done.

511
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,160
There's My Brother, My Brother, Me episodes

512
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

513
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,080
There's an episode we did where we asked each other

514
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
for advice.

515
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,800
There's an episode with Dad.

516
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
There's a lot of episodes where we ask each other for advice.

517
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah, it's all in there.

518
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
And not just us, you get to hear every show on the network.

519
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,680
It's incredible.

520
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,000
I care about material goods, though, unlike my brother.

521
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
So if you go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate

522
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
and you can pledge $10 a month,

523
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
you are going to get the aforementioned bonus content

524
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
and a pin.

525
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,800
You can choose every pin you want,

526
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,840
but if you do the smart thing

527
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,640
and choose the Megan Lencott design pin

528
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,480
that is for our show, it looks like a pizza

529
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,680
that I think has a face in it, but it's ghoulish

530
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,120
and it says Munch Squad on it.

531
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,760
Yeah.

532
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,960
And I think you're really gonna appreciate that.

533
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,880
At $20 a month, there's a beautiful 550-piece

534
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,760
maximum fun puzzle that you can put together or not.

535
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,120
There's a $35 monthly membership level.

536
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,800
And at that level, you're gonna get the poster.

537
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
You're gonna get the pin.

538
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,360
You're gonna get the puzzle.

539
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,160
There's no poster.

540
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,640
Let's list some stuff you're not gonna get.

541
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
You're not gonna get a poster.

542
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,600
You're not gonna get a new pair of shoes.

543
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
You're not gonna get, I don't know.

544
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
I was gonna say a hug, but if you see me at a convention

545
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
and you say, I'm a donor, I'll give you a hug.

546
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Yeah, you get something that rhymes with hug

547
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,760
and it's mug.

548
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,160
Yeah.

549
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,920
A mug, a monthly membership mug

550
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,000
with the max fun rocket on it.

551
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And we just, that's a good chunk of money,

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
but if you get a lot of entertainment out of it,

553
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,600
we don't force you to donate anything like Netflix does.

554
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,560
I guess it's not really donating at that point.

555
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,600
It's not a donation at that point.

556
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,480
That's just money cost.

557
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,520
It's paying it for a service.

558
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
But if our shows mean something to you

559
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
and you wanna help us make them,

560
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,280
then go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate

561
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,120
and you can help us do just that.

562
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,680
And I will say, your donations go a long way.

563
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,720
Even if you're like, I can only do $5 a month.

564
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Like really, is that such a big deal?

565
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,360
But here's the thing.

566
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,200
At this point, all of us and, well,

567
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
so all of us are full-time podcasters

568
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
and our wives do shows with us.

569
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
Our dad does shows with us.

570
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
Dad was an entertainer, but okay.

571
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Dad was able to retire and now like podcasting

572
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,000
is pretty much the main focus of our family.

573
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,160
And that is because of the years of support

574
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,760
from listeners and donors like you.

575
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
And we have a lot more projects

576
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,040
and a lot of things coming up

577
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,640
that we're very excited about.

578
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
And we're only able to focus on them

579
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
because of support from you.

580
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
And the network has grown.

581
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I feel like just in the last like six months,

582
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,920
the number of shows has doubled.

583
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
It's blown up right now.

584
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
Thank you all so much for your support.

585
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
If you're already a member,

586
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,720
if you can try to signal boost it on social media

587
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
with the hashtag maxfunddriver,

588
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
a link to maximumfund.org slash donate.

589
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,680
Or maybe consider bumping up your donation

590
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,120
if you're listening to more shows on the network

591
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
than you did last year.

592
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
Also, I mean, make sure that it would be a great thing to do

593
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
to make sure that like your card is still working.

594
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,160
And that is just sort of a natural thing

595
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,440
of being a pledge supported network

596
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
is we just lose a lot of donors

597
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,920
just from cards expiring and stuff like that.

598
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,800
So there's ways to get involved

599
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,160
no matter where you're at in life.

600
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,760
We should mention, by the way,

601
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
those gifts aside from the bonus material,

602
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,920
those gifts are for new and upgrading donors.

603
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,080
So if you're already at, let's say, the $10 level,

604
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
you're not gonna get the pin.

605
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
But if you update to the $20 level,

606
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,040
then you'll get all the $20 and the $10 and the $5 stuff.

607
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
Yeah, all the stuff.

608
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,600
Let's get back to the show.

609
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

610
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,080
Think about it.

611
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,440
And now did you wanna have me start reading again Yahoo

612
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
and then you interrupt it or what's up?

613
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I wasn't-

614
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,560
You gotta understand, man,

615
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,640
you've established a pattern of-

616
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
It's hurtful.

617
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,640
Trickery.

618
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
The thing is, Justin, you don't protest too much

619
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,440
when you ask for a Yahoo

620
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
because you'll say like,

621
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
oh, you know what, I would just love a Yahoo.

622
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Oh, Griffin, if only you would do a Yahoo,

623
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
that would be the balm on my soul.

624
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah, I'm so wet for Yahoo's, I'm so wet.

625
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
And then here's one that was sent in by Brendan.

626
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
Thank you, Brendan.

627
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,040
Okay, I do have one,

628
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,960
but I just didn't want it to be this big hostile thing.

629
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,520
All right, well, go ahead.

630
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,280
I'll do Brendan's shit later.

631
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,440
Okay, I mean, I do have one.

632
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

633
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,800
I just didn't want it to be-

634
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,000
What?

635
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,360
No, it's good, no, it's good.

636
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,920
No, no, no, because now it doesn't feel like a trick.

637
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,400
Now it feels like a natural flow.

638
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,040
It feels like we're in a flow.

639
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Yeah, but if the music doesn't interrupt you-

640
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,080
Okay, so I'll start over.

641
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,560
You know what?

642
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,840
I'll take this one for Griffin.

643
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
Would you like to interrupt me?

644
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,800
Yeah, that would be good, actually.

645
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Talk about some dumb shit.

646
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Okay, I wanna take a chance here to tell you guys

647
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,120
how much I love-

648
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,040
I was just gonna say how much I love you.

649
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,720
It just means a lot to me to be able to make this show.

650
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,240
I want a munch, squad.

651
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,080
It does hurt.

652
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,880
I want a munch, squad.

653
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,680
Are y'all down with Guy Fieri yet or what?

654
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,600
I think so.

655
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
Down with or down on Guy Fieri?

656
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
Down around?

657
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,680
Down by Guy Fieri, because he is-

658
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,920
Now that time it sounded like you said down by him.

659
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,120
I did.

660
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,280
Down by Guy Fieri.

661
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, just take a left on second and I'm down by Guy Fieri.

662
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,720
You can't miss me.

663
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,440
So good news for everybody on Earth,

664
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
especially those in Miami.

665
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,600
Chicken Guy.

666
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
Let me say it again, because there's an exclamation point

667
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,160
at the end.

668
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,640
Chicken Guy is a fast-

669
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,280
Chicken Guy.

670
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,000
It's a fast casual chain dedicated to the serving delicious succulent chicken.

671
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:58,480
Paired with 22 signature sauces meant to please all palates.

672
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,640
Hey, Guy, that's so many sauces.

673
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
Okay, here's two different sauces.

674
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
One is ranch.

675
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
One is ranch.

676
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,760
We threw down some stairs and then went and got it and gave it to you.

677
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,240
That's two different ones.

678
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,320
You can't have 22 or something and call them all signature sauces, right?

679
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
You can't put your signature on all these.

680
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,400
Like, if I sign my name 22 different ways, that's not my signature.

681
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,960
Leave a little meat on the bone for the rest of us, Guy.

682
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,720
Literally.

683
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
The menu at Chicken Guy features, you guessed it, fucking chicken.

684
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
All natural-

685
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,280
Chicken idiot.

686
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,640
How can you even read this?

687
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
All natural fresh chicken tenders, hand pounded, perfect.

688
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,280
Nice.

689
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,840
Perfect.

690
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,520
Hand pounded.

691
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,760
Ass slammed, just fucking primo meat.

692
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
Fucking shad rack chicken.

693
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
Hand pounded to maxi-

694
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,960
Finger blasted, just fucking-

695
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Just reached around to all of us.

696
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,840
Oh, God.

697
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,800
Okay, fresh chicken tenders, hand pounded to maximize crunch.

698
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,760
Oh, golly.

699
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,440
Hey, hand pounded to maximize crunch and paired with a wide selection of delicious sauces.

700
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,560
Hey, PR writer, you just said you got 22.

701
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,040
Like, we know it's a wide selection.

702
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,240
Stop fucking bragging and tell us about hand pounding chicken.

703
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,600
These are brine and fresh lemon juice.

704
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,040
Pickle brine.

705
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,720
Why is it called pickle brine?

706
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,680
You know, we're brining it.

707
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,400
It's brining.

708
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,320
It's brining in fresh lemon juice, pickle brine and buttermilk and infused with-

709
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
I don't think you brine and buttermilk, though.

710
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,800
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you don't combine lemon juice and buttermilk.

711
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm pretty sure that's not part of the process for your brining and buttermilk infused with

712
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,240
fresh herbs and these tenders deliver on flavor and texture.

713
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,920
We already know they're crunchy.

714
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,840
The menu features the tenders.

715
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,360
Grilled or fried.

716
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,080
I love these chicken tenders, but I want to strip away a lot of the excess and really

717
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,200
just enjoy the flavor of them.

718
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
Yeah, I want to see the knuckle marks from where Guy Fieri unleashed his rage with his

719
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,120
bare hands on these fucking things.

720
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
I mean, when you say hand pounded, you're insinuating the guy pounded them all, right?

721
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,320
Yeah.

722
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
That's what the insinuation is.

723
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,560
You can have them in sandwiches.

724
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,400
Straight up.

725
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Straight up on skewers or in meal-sized salad bowls.

726
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,000
Your choice of signature sauces to enjoy with the chicken as well.

727
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,080
We know, okay?

728
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,160
You have sauce in a lot of it.

729
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,240
We can have whatever we want.

730
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Please.

731
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
Just a double check.

732
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,760
You can get on a sandwich, on skewers, or on salad, but there is no just-

733
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,600
Can I just have it?

734
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
We can't just give them to you.

735
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Can you just hand me a Tendo?

736
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,520
There's going to be a lot of skewers eaten in Miami.

737
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,240
There's going to be a great deal of skewers just getting accidentally chomped down the gullet.

738
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,200
They're so delicious, they're worried that you'll try to eat your fingers off

739
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,280
if it's touching the chicken.

740
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,280
There are sides, like chicken guy fries with Guy's special fry seasoning.

741
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,720
There's crowd-pleasing mac daddy-

742
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,220
Salt!

743
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,840
It's salt and red stuff.

744
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,880
It's some red stuff I found.

745
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,760
I don't know what the red stuff is, but it hurts everyone's mouth.

746
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,040
I want to retroactively enjoy that they're called meal-sized salad bowls.

747
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
Guy Fieri looked at the salad and he's like,

748
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,800
what the fuck is this supposed to be?

749
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
It's not a meal?

750
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,720
What are you having for lunch?

751
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,360
This salad.

752
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,160
The fuck you are!

753
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,080
Where's your lunch?

754
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm going to punch a hole in this beach ball.

755
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,080
Let's just fill this motherfucker up with salad.

756
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,960
Now that's a meal.

757
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
Now give me a minute.

758
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
You might hear me slapping my chicken in the back room.

759
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah, I gotta punish it.

760
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,640
It's been a bad chicken.

761
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,640
Chicken Guy offers two delicious Flavortown frozen treats as well.

762
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,560
Guests can satisfy their sweet tooth with the triple double...

763
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,160
Triple double ice cream treat.

764
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,040
That's a six.

765
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
With triple chocolate and double mint.

766
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,000
Or the cinnamon apple.

767
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Which isn't as utilitarian as I was hoping from the name.

768
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,400
Anyway, I don't know much about fruit,

769
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,360
so I found this weird, this weird juicy red sweet chicken in the back.

770
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,520
And I rubbed this spicy dust all over it.

771
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
And I guess this is dessert.

772
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,400
Is this anything?

773
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,280
We have cinnamon apple.

774
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,720
We have sugar disc.

775
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
You're gonna love these.

776
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,360
Hey, hey, Valerie, bad news.

777
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
All our onions went bad.

778
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,040
Those are apples, Guy.

779
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,840
Are you kidding me?

780
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,240
These sweet apples are delicious.

781
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,560
I'm gonna put my special fry stuff on them and see what happens.

782
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,440
Fieri, a chef, TV personality, entrepreneur, and New York Times bestselling author.

783
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,840
You know, it's fun to imagine a person that doesn't know who Guy Fieri is,

784
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,400
but did read those first three paragraphs.

785
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,760
Like, who is this?

786
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,640
I am hooked.

787
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,080
I love it.

788
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,160
Once again, creating blends of spices and seasoning.

789
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,120
Oh my God.

790
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,400
He's brought his signature blend of authentic meats,

791
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,680
surprising flavors to Chicken Guy.

792
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Once again, creating blends of spices and seasonings

793
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,600
that keep his fans coming back for more.

794
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,880
I do appreciate that they are honest enough to admit

795
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,080
that it is people that enjoy Guy Fieri and not necessarily his cuisine

796
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
that are coming back to lap these things up.

797
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,840
In this new concept, Fieri has taken the chicken tender,

798
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,480
endowed it with a proprietary blend of flavors.

799
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,320
No, I endowed it.

800
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
Endowed it?

801
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,480
Bless it.

802
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
He is not the Lord.

803
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,880
And Fieri has looked down and blessed the chicken with some pepper, I guess.

804
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,940
Probably.

805
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,820
And then with God as my witness,

806
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,420
the next line of this is,

807
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,020
and provided guests with a myriad of delicious sauce options.

808
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,300
Fucking, if you look at me, Guy,

809
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,540
do you tell me about how many fucking sauces you have?

810
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,500
One more time, I'm gonna peel open your tear ducts

811
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,100
and I'm gonna pour your spicy double triple pickle habanero ranch right down them.

812
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,300
I knew the good people of Miami love the real deal.

813
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,860
Because some of my favorite diners, drive-ins, and dives joints are in the area, says Fieri.

814
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,260
Um, that's a pretty good Guy Fieri.

815
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,460
Thanks.

816
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,380
I do wish he had said,

817
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,740
I like that he felt the need to append joints.

818
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,300
My diners, drive-ins, and dives joints,

819
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,460
you could have just said anyway, Guy.

820
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,340
So I couldn't be more stoked to bring them the chicken guy at Aventura Mall.

821
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,620
Yeah, Aventura's in a mall.

822
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,740
Ah, sick.

823
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,060
Nice.

824
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,700
Cool, bro.

825
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,020
You know, real deal chicken tenders, 20 plus killer sauces.

826
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,980
You motherfucker!

827
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,820
I told you!

828
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,620
I warned you, Guy!

829
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,220
Get those ducts over here, Guy!

830
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,260
20 plus killer sauces and a whole lot of fun.

831
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Welcome to Flavortown, Miami.

832
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,800
All right.

833
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,020
I love, uh, two things.

834
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,140
I love many things in my life, but two things about this,

835
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,780
which is, uh, that he believes that these folks in Miami who love the real deal,

836
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,340
like someone might come visit perhaps and they'll go,

837
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
oh yeah, there's this tiny joint over there,

838
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,500
and oh, you can get this amazing sandwich over here.

839
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,180
But if you want the real deal,

840
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,140
the real shit,

841
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,820
you're gonna keep this down.

842
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,500
There's kind of a local secret.

843
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,660
You're gonna head to Chicken Guy's, you know, surprising Meats Authentic.

844
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,540
And we're so glad that Guy came here,

845
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,820
because finally, finally, someone brought some flavor to Miami.

846
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,180
Yeah, it's about time.

847
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,340
Justin, does it mention anywhere in that press release

848
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,660
if they offer any kind of sauces or anything?

849
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,620
In this one, we don't know about sauce count, really.

850
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,580
It's not specific.

851
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,900
That's a glaring omission.

852
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,500
It's a huge problem.

853
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,580
Can we just round robin ranch barbecue honey mustard?

854
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,460
That's only three.

855
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,140
And that's pretty much the standard options, I feel.

856
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,660
What about liquified chicken?

857
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeah, it's possible.

858
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,020
It's possible.

859
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,980
I like this chicken.

860
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,860
I just want it to taste more like chicken.

861
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,780
There's one more quote that I did want to share with you.

862
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,900
And it's one of the most American quotes we've ever had on the show.

863
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,620
I absolutely love working with Guy on Chicken Guy,

864
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,740
and I can't wait to open at Aventura Mall,

865
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,860
says Planet Hollywood founder and chairman Robert Earl.

866
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,660
We've found the perfect venture with Chicken Guy,

867
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,140
a proven crowd pleaser based on our first location at Disney Springs.

868
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,660
I can't believe you would do this at Mickey's house.

869
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,340
Let me do this.

870
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,580
You would do this at Mickey's house?

871
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,860
He lives there, dog.

872
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,020
Just inches away from his bed?

873
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,660
That's where Mickey lives and you do it at Mickey's house?

874
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,580
That's where his dog stays.

875
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,180
I think we had a listener at a live show

876
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,660
say he had Guy Fieri feed him a chicken tender

877
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,820
at this grand opening at Disney Springs.

878
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,340
I didn't hear any complaints about the meat

879
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,740
or the bevy of the, you know, the nearly two dozen sauces available.

880
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,100
So maybe this is good chicken.

881
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,900
Listen, I love a Tendo.

882
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,180
Given the chance, I'll eat it.

883
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,020
I know his nasty track record.

884
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,780
I'll still eat his Tendos.

885
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,820
I have a Yahoo here.

886
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,020
This one was sent in by Brendan.

887
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,820
Thanks, Brendan.

888
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,780
You did a good job.

889
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

890
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,700
Whoa, that's weird.

891
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,380
The box that usually has their name in it loads,

892
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,220
but it doesn't have their name in it.

893
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,180
It has nothing in it.

894
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,780
It says 15% best answers,

895
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,620
so that's actually maybe one of the highest I've seen.

896
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,260
They have 52,365 Yahoo points,

897
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,780
which has earned them the level of seven.

898
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,700
And they've done 11,934 answers.

899
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,020
This person is the chosen one, but I can't see their name.

900
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,100
That's Yahoo for you.

901
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,780
My user has no name.

902
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,740
It might be Neo.

903
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,820
So Neo asks,

904
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,700
if you could create a potion,

905
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,940
what type of potion would it be?

906
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,540
Basically, what would you name it?

907
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,820
And what effect would it have?

908
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,740
That is, perhaps, and we had a lot on here.

909
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,980
The most wide open question I've ever heard on Yahoo Answers.

910
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,460
You know what?

911
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,780
It's almost so general that it makes you worried

912
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,940
you won't be able to do good jokes about it.

913
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,780
It almost gets you to that point.

914
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,940
I would like to make a potion

915
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,500
that makes me think of funny potion jokes.

916
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,180
Okay, Griffin, you picked it.

917
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,460
You start us off with your best potion zinger.

918
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,780
I wish there was a potion I could drink

919
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,180
when I walk onto an airplane

920
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,420
that would guarantee that I wouldn't have to use the bathroom

921
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,780
at all until the plane lands.

922
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,260
That's pretty good.

923
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,460
Actually, no, sorry.

924
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,700
Because then the genie's gonna catch me in a trick

925
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,100
if I say it like that, because the plane's gonna land

926
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,900
and then I'm gonna release myself while we're on the tarmac.

927
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,420
Is it a potion or a genie?

928
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
Is that a genie potion?

929
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,220
If you pour water in a genie bottle and you drink it,

930
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,860
what happens?

931
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
No, it's a potion, but the potion bottle

932
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,780
also just happens to have a genie in it.

933
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,260
Oh, okay.

934
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,460
So the plane lands and then once we taxi to the gate,

935
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,700
and then get off, and I make it to the toilet,

936
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,780
I sit down on it, then I can go.

937
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,220
But not before that.

938
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,620
I chug it as I'm crossing the threshold of the plane.

939
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,900
And I say chug, I wouldn't want it to be a lot of fluid.

940
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,700
I would want it to be a pretty small-

941
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,660
Like a shot.

942
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,980
Yeah, it was even smaller than that, a little vial.

943
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,300
And I just drink that and then all the pee goes away,

944
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,780
all poo goes away, and then it doesn't come back

945
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,300
until I make it to Tallahassee.

946
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,540
Which is my turn of phrase that I use.

947
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,860
No, that's rude.

948
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,900
I just went to Tallahassee.

949
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,620
It was lovely.

950
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,180
But that's my potion, and it's relevant

951
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,300
because I just flew today and there was stuff.

952
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,260
There was stuff that happened.

953
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,500
Things happen.

954
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,900
That's not a long flight, Ruben.

955
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,380
Things happen.

956
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,140
I know I've talked about this on the show before,

957
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,700
and for some reason I was just like,

958
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,580
on fire today up in the air.

959
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,660
And I swear to God, I swear to God, this is not a joke.

960
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,820
Diagonal from me, an older gentleman

961
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,860
was watching the fucking second Eddie Redmayne movie,

962
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,260
the second The Crimes of Grindelwald.

963
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,380
And why?

964
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,860
What are the freaking odds, man?

965
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,460
Anyway, no pee-plane potion.

966
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:33,960
Justin?

967
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,300
I would do-

968
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,780
Hold on, you're funny, Ruben.

969
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,180
Okay.

970
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,700
Well, give me a second.

971
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,100
Hold on.

972
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,620
Flight.

973
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,260
Flight.

974
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,660
Flight.

975
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,620
Flight. Now, I do feel like that is maybe a little derivative

976
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,100
of ribbons, because he talked about flying in here.

977
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,620
I talked about flying in mine.

978
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,060
Should we put-

979
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

980
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,540
Start over.

981
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,420
Start the-

982
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,220
Okay, okay.

983
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,620
Start the-

984
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,900
Oh, let me restart the clock.

985
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,400
Okay.

986
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,320
Strong.

987
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,240
I see.

988
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:08,900
Very-

989
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,220
Strong.

990
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,660
Very strong.

991
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,020
Very strong.

992
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,780
With- Let me choose.

993
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,020
Okay.

994
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,420
Very strong with the potion.

995
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,980
Oh, okay.

996
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,620
Thanks to the potion.

997
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,700
So strong.

998
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,780
So, wait, the potion makes you strong?

999
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,820
Yeah, that's-

1000
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,320
Potion.

1001
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,460
Potion makes Justin strong.

1002
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,900
Potion makes Justin strong.

1003
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
What do you do with that strength once you get it?

1004
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,340
Like, what do you need the strong for?

1005
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,220
Lifting.

1006
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,420
Potion gives Justin strong lifting?

1007
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,220
Yeah, good.

1008
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,720
Good.

1009
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,620
Good at lifting.

1010
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,940
Good at lifting. Best at punch.

1011
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,440
Yeah.

1012
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,140
Okay, potion make Justin good lifter.

1013
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,260
Best puncher.

1014
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,660
And if there's a heavy push that needs-

1015
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,100
Yeah, like a big door.

1016
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,340
Yeah.

1017
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,980
If to push.

1018
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,740
For sure.

1019
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,860
Champion of push.

1020
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,060
And how long does it last?

1021
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,260
Hour.

1022
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,900
Hour.

1023
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,420
Yeah, you don't want it to be too long.

1024
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,460
Big push.

1025
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,700
Push champion.

1026
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,820
Best at punching.

1027
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,300
Yeah.

1028
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,340
To lift.

1029
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,900
For hour.

1030
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,780
For hour.

1031
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,740
Strong of potion.

1032
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,940
Good job, Justin.

1033
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,660
That's a good one.

1034
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
I would just like a potion that's cherry flavored.

1035
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,000
No.

1036
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,660
No, I'm not-

1037
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,300
No.

1038
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,580
No, I'm not gonna let you turn this into a fucking gag, Trav.

1039
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,060
Not this time.

1040
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,580
It's gonna give you cool powers.

1041
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,900
I would like a potion.

1042
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,140
Yeah.

1043
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,940
And when I drink it, it kind of impairs my judgment a little bit.

1044
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,580
Maybe it makes it a little bit relaxed.

1045
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,340
You're gonna do another freaking gag.

1046
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,940
I don't want the gag, Travis.

1047
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,140
I want a big, powerful brother that drink a big potion.

1048
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,020
Not powerful.

1049
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,660
Powerful is my-

1050
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,140
Powerful is Justin's.

1051
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,020
Justin gets strong.

1052
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,740
Yeah.

1053
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,700
I'd like a potion.

1054
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,300
Make me fast.

1055
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,980
All right.

1056
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,060
Now you're cooking.

1057
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,700
Now we're fucking talking about it, baby.

1058
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,200
And I-

1059
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,420
Oh, how fast?

1060
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,940
I would run and people would be like,

1061
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,000
damn.

1062
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,260
Yeah.

1063
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,740
Fast.

1064
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,380
But I wouldn't like to be so fast that it's like a big deal.

1065
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,100
Yeah.

1066
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,260
I would just like to be faster.

1067
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,700
Yeah.

1068
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,060
I feel like this is how it was in the Marvel writers room back in the 60s.

1069
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,300
And then Stan Lee was like, okay, start over.

1070
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,620
Hold on.

1071
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,340
Let's try this again.

1072
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,700
What about spiders?

1073
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,940
Is there anything there that we could do?

1074
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,980
Oh, that's a good point.

1075
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,580
Justin's Spider-Man potion is what I want.

1076
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I didn't even think about fucking Spider-Man posting.

1077
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,060
Yeah.

1078
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,380
Sorry, yeah, guys.

1079
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,420
So like he did in the comics where he drank the potion that the magic man made in the forest.

1080
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,900
And then he was able to turn into a spider.

1081
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,340
I would like that potion as well.

1082
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,740
I would actually-

1083
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,220
You know what?

1084
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,060
I'd like 10 of that potion so that I can do it 10 times.

1085
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,900
I would like a potion-

1086
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:41,700
Yeah?

1087
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,940
That gives me money.

1088
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,340
Now, there's actually a Yahoo Answers user here who, well, they said they wanted a potion

1089
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,380
that would take me places wherever I go without worrying of needing an airplane, driving a

1090
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,420
vehicle, taking a bus, or heck, even riding a bicycle or tricycle to reach a certain destination.

1091
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,860
And then also a potion that would make me a millionaire.

1092
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,420
A potion that would make you a millionaire, huh?

1093
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,020
You would have to shit money.

1094
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,100
Yeah, you would have to turn into money in your guts.

1095
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,220
And you don't want that.

1096
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,500
That's the only thing, maybe piss money, but who wants to piss money?

1097
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,780
Oh, what if I drink that potion and the no pee potion?

1098
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,820
Oh no, you'd have a bunch of money in your tummy.

1099
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,260
Full up.

1100
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,060
I would like to have a potion that helps me understand the gastrointestinal process.

1101
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,460
I think a potion for many potions.

1102
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,780
Uh-huh.

1103
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,100
If you drink a potion and it gives you a thousand potions.

1104
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,060
But each one of those does the same thing.

1105
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,660
Oh, shit.

1106
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Well, now you're going to have so many potions, Justin.

1107
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,020
You're going to have to drink a potion to have a whole house to keep your potions in.

1108
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,140
Enough potion for all.

1109
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,140
Oh, Justin, that's lovely.

1110
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,940
I'd like to buy the world a potion.

1111
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,180
Yeah.

1112
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,060
Why didn't they ever- why didn't they name it Coca-Cola?

1113
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,300
They could have just called it brown potion.

1114
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,980
Man, fuck, that'd be awesome.

1115
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,700
It's so good.

1116
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,540
Can I have diet brown potion?

1117
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,500
Can I have a drink where you just kind of mix all the potions together?

1118
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,260
Oh, that's fun.

1119
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,020
I can kind of not pee on an airplane.

1120
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,820
And also I'm a little strong.

1121
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:20,740
Folks, we come to you once every year and ask you to pay for all the great entertainment

1122
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,540
that you've given us.

1123
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:22,740
What?

1124
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,700
Yes, dance for us.

1125
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,820
No, I mean, we give you entertainment.

1126
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,540
God damn.

1127
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,220
No, keep going.

1128
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,860
Damn.

1129
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,660
We do our best over here at the studio and we just wanted to let you know that if you

1130
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:42,260
wanted to leave a few coins in the hat, as it were, as we finished our juggling show

1131
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,260
or our magic or street magic.

1132
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,860
I was doing a living statue.

1133
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,100
Travis is doing a living statue.

1134
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
We've all got our different talents that we're showing off here.

1135
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,940
I'm doing back- I do backflips.

1136
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,460
I can stand very still.

1137
00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:02,740
It has allowed us to go all over the country and visit all of y'all and one by one, one

1138
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,420
by one and come to your house and eat your minestrone out your cupboard when you're

1139
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,380
not looking.

1140
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,900
And where did that minestrone go?

1141
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,460
We ate it.

1142
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,820
Thanks to your donations.

1143
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,020
Thank you.

1144
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,780
And we have always been so moved by your support and it means so much to us.

1145
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:26,820
And it really does help us to keep doing this show and to make the kind of- the thing we

1146
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,820
hear from people a lot of the time is I wish that there was more of this kind of stuff

1147
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,020
in the world because we try really hard to be nice and make nice stuff that will make

1148
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,140
people happy and feel good and not hurt people.

1149
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,340
And I think that when you donate to our show, and I think all the Max Fun shows share that

1150
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:51,060
ethos, I feel like when you donate to the network, it's your way of voting that like

1151
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,340
that is the kind of thing you would like to see more of.

1152
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:02,340
There's a lot of places that are super well funded with a lot of, I will say, corporate

1153
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,780
cash that are making entertainment that isn't really designed to make any one person extremely

1154
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,340
happy, just make everybody feel sort of okay.

1155
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:18,260
And it doesn't necessarily have making the world a slightly better place to be at the

1156
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,700
top of its priorities list.

1157
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,140
And that's really important to us.

1158
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,660
I would say the most important thing to us.

1159
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,380
And I feel like when you donate to us and the network, then that is your way of voting

1160
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,980
for that kind of entertainment.

1161
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,980
The gifts are great and we know that they're beautiful and cool to get and the promo material

1162
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,220
is great.

1163
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,740
But I think that maybe the best reward, I think, as a Max Fun donor is knowing that

1164
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,780
I am voting for the kind of entertainment I want to see more of in the world.

1165
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,900
And this is the time of year that you can do exactly that over at maximumfun.org forward

1166
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,700
slash donate.

1167
00:47:53,700 --> 00:48:00,020
I will also say something that has impressed me over and over again and without fail is

1168
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,340
the Max Fun community as a whole is amazing.

1169
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:11,460
Like both our listeners and also the other hosts and the Max Fun staff and like everybody

1170
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,740
that works, we have a lot of fun all hanging out.

1171
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,060
We do meetups and Max Fun Con and all of this kind of stuff.

1172
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,660
And it's a blast.

1173
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,580
Everybody is very nice and fun and it's great.

1174
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:30,260
And speaking of, coming up on the Tuesday of the second week of Max Fun Drives, there's

1175
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,300
going to be meetups maybe everywhere in the world, depending on if you want to set those

1176
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:35,780
up.

1177
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:44,100
But go to maximumfun.org forward slash meetup, I believe, or it's maximumfun.org slash

1178
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,700
meetups2019 to see if there's one near you.

1179
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,060
We're putting together one here in Cincinnati that I will be visiting if you want to come

1180
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,100
and check that out.

1181
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,020
So we're going to finish talking about Max Fun Drive now, but go to maximumfun.org forward

1182
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,780
slash donate.

1183
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,660
You pick the shows you want to support and you get some cool gifts, get the bonus content,

1184
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,260
get the pin, get the mug, get whatever you feel comfortable with.

1185
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,580
If you can share the drive with your friends on social media, that means a lot.

1186
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,100
If you can think about upgrading, if you're already a donor and you've been tuning into

1187
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,180
more stuff, you know, just think about it.

1188
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,020
But do it now before you before you forget.

1189
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,420
It's maximumfun.org slash donate.

1190
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,340
And let us know if you want to tweet at us or tweet at McElroy family or just, you know,

1191
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,700
whatever tweet that you donated so we can say thank you.

1192
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,300
And now it's time for Farm Wisdom.

1193
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,340
Farm wisdom.

1194
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,180
Farm wisdom.

1195
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,980
Ain't no harm around this farm.

1196
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,940
Farm wisdom.

1197
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,940
Pretty good.

1198
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,940
Yeah, I guess it's a very ethical farm you're leading there.

1199
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,460
Um, here is some alpaca facts from Adrian.

1200
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,660
Thank you, Adrian.

1201
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:05,780
One, when male alpacas get randy, they make a sound called orgling, which sounds exactly

1202
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,220
like how you think it does.

1203
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,900
I don't, I don't think it, I don't know.

1204
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,420
I can't generate in my mind the sound that I think that means.

1205
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,900
They also don't ejaculate so much as dribble throughout the whole thing.

1206
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,260
So alpaca sex can take up to 45 minutes to finish.

1207
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,860
That's 43 minutes longer than anyone's ever had sex.

1208
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,860
Yeah, dribble, all dribbling, huh?

1209
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,500
That's, uh, I know that we all know that feel, right?

1210
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,100
Right?

1211
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,340
Here is the sound of orgling.

1212
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,380
I've prepared it for you.

1213
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,620
Oh, good.

1214
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,020
Oh yeah, nothing says let's have sex like that sound.

1215
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:49,220
It only goes on for another minute and 20 seconds.

1216
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,220
Oh my god.

1217
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,420
Hey, toss that on the soundboard.

1218
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:56,740
Yeah.

1219
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,260
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

1220
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,660
I also really like this fact because Adrian has written,

1221
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,860
alpacas have the cutest terms for the things they do.

1222
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,620
And I would argue, Adrian, that they are not the alpacas terms.

1223
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,500
But probably not.

1224
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,860
Justin, quit putting on your fucking-

1225
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,780
your horny alpaca soundcloud.

1226
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,420
Turn it off.

1227
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,500
I can't hear it anymore.

1228
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,980
Can you guys still hear it?

1229
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,660
Yes, yes, very much.

1230
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,580
I will always hear it forever.

1231
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,140
Oh, that's fun.

1232
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,380
I turned off my monitor so I can't hear it.

1233
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,500
But Adrian writes, when alpacas-

1234
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,060
when an alpaca sits down and tucks its leg underneath it,

1235
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,340
it's called cushing.

1236
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,620
When they bounce up and down in the field like Pepe Le Pew,

1237
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,580
it's called pronking.

1238
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,380
And when alpacas do decide to talk, they-

1239
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,180
Pronking.

1240
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,980
Pronking.

1241
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,820
That sounds like they should-

1242
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,780
all of those also sound like sex stuff that they could be doing.

1243
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,820
See, I was gonna say,

1244
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,540
pronking kind of sounds like a new show from Jamie Kennedy.

1245
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,020
Maybe.

1246
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,300
Like, oh man, I got pronked.

1247
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,420
I got pronked by JK, dang.

1248
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,100
I got pronked by that orglar.

1249
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,620
Stop, hold on.

1250
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,180
Is there still alpaca sex noises happening?

1251
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,940
Because I keep hearing stuff in the background.

1252
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,460
That doesn't seem possible.

1253
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,980
It's not on my end, I will say.

1254
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,500
That might just be a ghost in the machine.

1255
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,620
Oh shit, okay.

1256
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,220
Also, we have more farm wisdom here

1257
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,780
because it's the extra farm wisdom

1258
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,820
because it's Max Fun Drive.

1259
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,060
This is from AJ,

1260
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,700
and AJ says that they worked with cows as a teenager

1261
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,340
and the most effective way to milk several hundred cows

1262
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,540
is by using a giant rotating cow carousel

1263
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,260
called the rotolactor.

1264
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,020
The cows line themselves up and step on one by one

1265
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,780
on a giant rotating platform

1266
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,820
and then slowly spin around as they get milked.

1267
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,020
And when they're done, they're back at the gate

1268
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,660
and they can walk off so the next cow can get on.

1269
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,740
But sometimes the cows don't want to get off

1270
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,260
because it's super fun.

1271
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,020
And the farmer has to give them a little push

1272
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,500
to remind them to let another cow have their turn.

1273
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,140
That's so great.

1274
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,260
That's good, I like that.

1275
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,180
I wish it had maybe how public restrooms worked or something.

1276
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,020
Oh shit, yeah, that'd be amazing.

1277
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,100
That'd be so cool.

1278
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,940
Well, I feel smarter and more rural.

1279
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,820
Do we have another question?

1280
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,700
I feel like a cow on a rotolactor.

1281
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,980
That's the thing I'm gonna start saying

1282
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,820
when I'm having a really great time.

1283
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,700
Here's a question.

1284
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,100
I recently purchased my first home, congratulations.

1285
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,500
However, it is an antique house

1286
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,380
with older toilets and thin walls.

1287
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,940
This all adds up to a very, very loud echo

1288
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,300
whenever anyone pees.

1289
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,660
I'm considering putting up a sign

1290
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,780
that says pee however you like.

1291
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,620
But if you pee standing up straight into the bowl,

1292
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,420
you will be heard.

1293
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,100
Thoughts?

1294
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,100
That's from a little too loud in Alabama.

1295
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,220
Who's still doing this?

1296
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:44,660
I think that you will be heard is oddly threatening.

1297
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,100
You will be heard.

1298
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,940
We will know that the peeing is happening.

1299
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,540
Who still pees straight into the bowl?

1300
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,660
Who's still doing this?

1301
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,900
Who's blasting off into the water

1302
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,940
and not aiming for the side of the porcelain?

1303
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,660
No one wants to hear that shit.

1304
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,580
I will also say, so we have potty trained BB,

1305
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,460
but part of the process was like bring your kid in

1306
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,980
so you could potty and make it see,

1307
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,020
I guess how rad it is.

1308
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,540
So I would sit down to pee and man,

1309
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,660
I'm never going back.

1310
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,140
Like I love sitting down to pee.

1311
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,100
It's so comfortable.

1312
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,860
Why wouldn't I give myself?

1313
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,540
Hey, you've been working hard.

1314
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,500
You work hard.

1315
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,780
You play hard.

1316
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,580
Sit down to pee.

1317
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,340
Travis McElroy.

1318
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,380
Take a load off, brother.

1319
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,140
Take a load off, Annie.

1320
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,940
Sit down to pee.

1321
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,620
I feel like sitting down to pee,

1322
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,300
I'd lose myself in a book.

1323
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,100
Oh yeah.

1324
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,260
Sometimes I just fall asleep on there.

1325
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,700
Is that so bad though?

1326
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,260
Nah, but I got a lot of things to do.

1327
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,620
You could do them on the toilet.

1328
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,300
Nah, that's just your mind talking, baby.

1329
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,340
You gotta sit down on that toilet and let it go

1330
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,020
and then dive on into a...

1331
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,940
I have a little portable DVD player

1332
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,180
I keep in every bathroom in my house

1333
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,540
and sometimes I'll sit down to do a number one

1334
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,540
and put a film on in the DVD collections

1335
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,140
I keep in every bathroom in my house.

1336
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,100
Yeah, I've hidden DVD players in bathrooms

1337
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,100
all over this country as we've toured.

1338
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,540
It's good to have those dead drops.

1339
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,900
I remember, yeah, we did a show in Phoenix, I believe,

1340
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,380
and I left a dead drop there with a bug's life in it.

1341
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,780
So I took a pee and I watched most of a bug's life.

1342
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,860
That's why I keep going back to Boston.

1343
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,580
I've just been trying to finish the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

1344
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,080
Yeah.

1345
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,380
I gotta find out what happens to them hobbits in that ring.

1346
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:31,880
Yep.

1347
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,540
It all works out in the end.

1348
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,340
Spoilies!

1349
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:34,900
Spoilies!

1350
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,200
Sorry, bud.

1351
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,900
Do they get to Mordor?

1352
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,300
Yeah, but it turns out to be a letdown

1353
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,500
and it turns out that the real Mordor always the friends of you.

1354
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,380
I would just tell people, so what?

1355
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,060
Like, yeah, we all pee.

1356
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:53,940
So what?

1357
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,740
It doesn't matter.

1358
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,940
What's embarrassing about that?

1359
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,740
I'm peeing.

1360
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,540
I'm loving it.

1361
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,500
I'm living life.

1362
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,980
I've got a thick, ropey brain of fury.

1363
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,420
Like, just let me do my thing.

1364
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,980
Well, it's very, very loud.

1365
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,420
It's just so loud.

1366
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,860
I get that, but also, like, I very, very don't care.

1367
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,060
I'm almost four years old.

1368
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,100
Like, I'm glad I'm peeing.

1369
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,140
I'm glad I'm here to pee.

1370
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,740
That makes me so happy that I'm functioning and all is well.

1371
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,940
And I'm just peeing.

1372
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,860
I'm just peeing, hey, you know what?

1373
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,540
Why don't you do something more fun?

1374
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,060
Why are you so bored that you're listening to people pee?

1375
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Maybe get an audio book or something.

1376
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,420
Watch an episode of Frasier.

1377
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,940
Go revisit Fringe.

1378
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,820
It holds up.

1379
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,020
Does it?

1380
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,700
I've never made it past the first season.

1381
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,140
Yeah, Trav, it's real good.

1382
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,820
Sydney's been rewatching it and I've been rewatching the end of episodes.

1383
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,220
Sometimes I come in the room and it holds up.

1384
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,020
How about you tell your friends, but you say it in a way of like,

1385
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,740
when they come back, you're like, hey, that sounded really healthy.

1386
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,700
Yeah.

1387
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,500
Good for you.

1388
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,700
I'm proud of you.

1389
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,860
And then when all your friends come over, they're like,

1390
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,340
oh, I love peeing at their house.

1391
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,140
Like, I get told what a good job I'm doing.

1392
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,060
Sometimes when I would take Bibi,

1393
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,500
where Bibi would, I would potty and then Bibi would clap for me.

1394
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,220
And I never knew how much I wanted that.

1395
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,900
You needed that approbation for sure.

1396
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,180
Fucking amazing.

1397
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,340
I kind of wish my friends would do that for me.

1398
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:16,980
Okay.

1399
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,140
If you put up a sign, you're going to make the person very paranoid

1400
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,340
about how loud that they piss.

1401
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,340
That's not great.

1402
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,540
If you don't put up a sign, the person will pee very loud.

1403
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,900
It will make a loud noise and other people will hear it.

1404
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,980
But speaking from my experience as a 38 years as a human being,

1405
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
when that person returns downstairs,

1406
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,500
none of the gathered humans will take it upon themselves and say,

1407
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,780
ha ha, heard you piss.

1408
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,420
Yeah.

1409
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:42,920
True.

1410
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,020
Not going to happen.

1411
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,540
Unless, unless, unless.

1412
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,460
Well, if you go out of your way to kind of turn your house

1413
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,260
into a sort of piss venue where the natural acoustics have a,

1414
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,860
it's like your house becomes the Red Rocks Amphitheater for piss.

1415
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,140
This is what I'm saying.

1416
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,660
Make it a celebration.

1417
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,340
A friend comes in and you're like,

1418
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,660
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage.

1419
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,540
Brian, let's see what kind of thick ropey braids he's.

1420
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,420
We can't anymore.

1421
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,500
Bring into the porcelain stage.

1422
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,220
He'll let it rip, right, right.

1423
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,940
And then at the end of the year, maybe do like an award ceremony.

1424
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,740
Mm hmm.

1425
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,220
Love that.

1426
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:19,700
Yeah.

1427
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,260
Sure.

1428
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,660
I love that.

1429
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,100
Call your house yearning town.

1430
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,980
No, that's a musical.

1431
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,260
Oh, fuck, you're right.

1432
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,460
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our program.

1433
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,980
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

1434
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,300
We, again, I'm not going to give you the hard press,

1435
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,220
but if you can find it in a few minutes,

1436
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,620
go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate

1437
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,220
and commit to a few bucks every month,

1438
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,020
that would really help us out a lot.

1439
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,940
And it really means a lot that you all have done that for us

1440
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,660
throughout the years.

1441
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:52,340
And if you would make this year the same thing again,

1442
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,220
that would just be the top.

1443
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:53,940
That'd be cool.

1444
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,860
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1445
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,540
for these for a theme song, It's a Departure,

1446
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,060
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1447
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,220
It's a fantastic album.

1448
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,260
And we are honored to have it as our theme song.

1449
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,900
And yeah, we've talked about maximumfun.org a lot already.

1450
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,340
Our website's mcroy.fan.

1451
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,460
We got new stuff on there.

1452
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,260
We got, I was going to say a new monster factor,

1453
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,860
but by the time this episode comes out,

1454
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,980
it will actually be quite old.

1455
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,940
We do have merch up there, which you can find.

1456
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,260
And also you can still get tickets to our San Jose

1457
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,380
and Salt Lake City shows.

1458
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,140
And we should be announcing more dates soon.

1459
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,260
So keep an eye on that.

1460
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,500
And on our Twitter account, at mcroyfamily,

1461
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,980
and we'll announce it there as well.

1462
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,060
Y'all want the final Yahoo?

1463
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,820
Yes, yes.

1464
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,140
A bunch of people sent this one in, thanks everybody.

1465
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,420
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

1466
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,780
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them.

1467
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:50,500
Beppo asks, how many calories are there in soap?

1468
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,900
My name is Justin McElroy.

1469
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,340
I'm Travis McElroy.

1470
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1471
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,820
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1472
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,540
Kiss your dad.

1473
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:13,060
Squat on the lips.
