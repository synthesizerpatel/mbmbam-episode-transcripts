1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's up, you cool baby?

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What's up, you cool baby?

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's up, you cool baby?

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's up, you cool baby?

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's up, you cool baby?

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm familiar, but not too not familiar. It's a new craze.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm familiar, but not too not familiar. It's a new craze.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
One more time for our friend, Len, if you don't mind.

14
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Keep an eye on that guy.

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, he's going places.

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, by the way, Len, you're so welcome for your big break.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So glad we could provide that.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He left.

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I just want to start things off. I want to say thank you to Paul, who gave us this terrible ticking clock.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
To our deaths.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right in front of me.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like the Chilean miners who emerged so many years ago.

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We've returned here.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How long before that reference just becomes self referential instead of actually referential?

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When people say like the Chilean miners and you're like, you mean the My Brother, My Brother and Me guys?

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, listen, I have spent my entire life wondering what 300,000 horny people.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's 300,000 people?

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Holy shit.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
3,000 horny people.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey, y'all sound like 300,000 people.

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brooklyn, best fans in the world.

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Best fans in the world.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Riches and shit.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Every time I come to Brooklyn, I say it always sounds like there's one person is 300.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I did the math bad. Never mind.

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You did so bad.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We got to stop pre-drinking. I say it every time.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And during drinking and post drinking. We're old.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I mean, we had some fun there, but there's a fucking lot of people.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here's the nice thing though. Statistically, some of you will enjoy the show.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The more people are here, the better chance we have that someone walks out going, you know, that was pretty good.

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah. We got to touch on like every fetish we can think of.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They're walking in like, you know, I didn't enjoy most of it.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The foot stuff though.

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chef's kiss.

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That one part where they're talking about the stuff on the butt.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Love it.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So we've been, we found the butt fan.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So we've been together now for a couple of days.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And this is a horrible transition from talking about the butt fan.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I, we're all, you know, hot young dads, hot young daddies.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I love, I love being around you all in your element because I get to see like how y'all are dadding out.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I was wondering if we could start the show out of Travis.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You could tell me about the little anecdote that you shared with me shortly a few moments ago about your,

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
your father of the year sort of moment.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's about to say a sentence and I'm so excited for it.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you like me that you've been spending the last 30 seconds envisioning exactly how he's going to phrase it?

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's like cellar door.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's like the most phonetically pleasing sentence imaginable.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's going to say it and I'm excited because the crowd's going to just explode.

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I should preface this.

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you know, listen, you have to say this.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's nine words Travis that you have to say.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I dropped a fidget spinner on my baby's head.

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There it is.

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Went down real good.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I know.

74
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me preface this.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have impulse control problems.

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So my baby was taking a nap.

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, it gets better, right?

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I looked at my wife and said, wouldn't it be funny if I spun this so that it spun upon her forehead?

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How long have you been in the fidget spinning game?

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Cause that's a pro level maneuver.

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Apparently not long.

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And let me be clear at that moment, my brain unchecked went, yeah.

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so spun it and I kind of jokingly waved it over my daughter's head at which point it spun off my fingers and bombed my sleeping daughter in the face.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And she woke up and I shushed her back to sleep saying forget.

85
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll never recover from this.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a pretty sad comment on the state of affairs, though, that when Travis told us this anecdote, my and Griffin first reaction was, well, there's the intro.

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So his loss is our gain.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Listen, I wish I could say I'm just doing my best, but I'm clearly not.

89
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That wasn't, no.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I also should be clear, and this is, I can't, I can't stress this enough.

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I did not buy this fidget spinner.

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's really important to me that you all know that.

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I feel like most fidget spinners should say on, have printed on them.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't buy this.

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It was in a bag that was given to me at an event and I said, well, this is my end.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Finally, the fidget spinner lifestyle I've been looking for.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Better drop this on my kids.

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Real quick question.

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Anybody in here have a fidget spinner with them right now?

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait, please, just a show of hands.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm just trying to get an idea.

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are they still happening?

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Get the spinners up in the air.

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm curious if the spinners are still hot.

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, God, I feel a breeze coming from the audience.

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's so nice.

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So if you've never listened, anybody never listened to our show before?

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, how weird was that song about shrimp?

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We're very smart and good at things and this is how we help.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I dropped the fidget spinner.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's some things we're okay at.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I should actually just leave the stage now.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You did detract from your bona fides.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's get in it.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is the etiquette for telling someone that they were in your dream last night?

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is it ever acceptable?

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is it ever not awkward?

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What if it was a particularly rad dream where you fought zombies together?

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Does that make it okay?

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's from Dreaming Duo in Ohio and New York.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you here?

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All right.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Can I just say, at live shows, whenever I ask that question, are you here?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's always this weird like half a beat where I think, they're not here.

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then someone says, woo.

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I think, they're lying.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like they waited to see if someone else responded first.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, they're playing an extended game of werewolf.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Like, oh, I'm here.

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, I've been here the whole time.

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For sure.

134
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was the here one that was here.

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There is no way you can tell me in a sentence, I had this dream about you last night where we were fighting zombies,

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
where I'm not going to be looking for the gap in that sentence where you edit it out and then we did it in the dream.

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The problem really comes from like every time you say to someone, you were in my dream last night,

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
they immediately become 13 years old and they like start 13 year old giggling like, was I any good?

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And it's like, that's the problem.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's the problem.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's just break that down.

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's the equivalent of saying, hey, I thought about you yesterday.

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm like, about boning me?

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I may be alone in this.

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't think I am.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm pretty sure everybody else is in the same boat.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But whenever I hear someone start a vignette with, so I had this dream last night, my immediate reaction is, oh, good.

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I had some other stuff I had to think about.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let me go ahead and fire that up real quick.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
To be fair, you can pretty much respond to any dream sentence with, really?

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wow.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Great.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How many clouds?

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel the same way about, I have this idea for a movie and I'm like, ah, great.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What was it that I had to get at Costco today?

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That explains so much.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Both of those were subtly targeted at Travis.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He's got a lot of pitches.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Some of them are good.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And you'll never know.

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because I don't pay attention to them.

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
How about a Yahoo?

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Can I just say, I now have this ticking down letting me know how long we've spent on some bits and it's like, that was a two minute bit.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, no.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you.

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Save me from myself.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're welcome.

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It'll be my burden.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Morgan Davey, are you here?

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Nope.

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know where anyone lives.

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yahoo Answers, anonymous Yahoo Answers user, going to call him Kevin, asks, some Kevins

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in the crowd tonight.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What's up, my Kevins?

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, I'm feeling these Kevins.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Kevin asks, can I eat a meatball sub while sick?

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have a stuffy nose, a sore throat, and I threw up around midnight, but I feel better today.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Can I eat it?

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The next two sentences are so good.

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want it so bad.

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
My dad made them, by the way.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's not from Subway or anything.

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, I will say, to Kevin's defense, the traditional Kevin defense, every time I am

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
sick, there's something in my brain that goes, you know what you want?

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And it's like the word, like you want a hamburger, right?

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And I was like, I don't.

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's all I crave.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like my body's like, let's really flush this out.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The way you think about eating when you are sick is so whack, because it's like, oh, I've

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
got a cold.

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That means I can only eat dry Cheerios.

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it's like, probably not.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I want dry waffles.

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's all I ever want, just toast up some waffles.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think that's a nature versus nurture thing, where like if you're 10 and your parents are

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
like, oh, you're sick.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Here's some toast and Sprite.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're like, that's sick food.

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Cool.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All right, here we go.

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I want to talk about-

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Flat Sprite is the thing we didn't like.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What don't you love?

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I would lose my fucking gourd.

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If I went into a restaurant, I saw someone eating toast and flat Sprite.

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What if you went to a doctor and the doctor's like, I see.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let me prescribe.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is going to sound a little weird.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hang with me.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A meatball sub.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's got all the vitamins you need.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Homemade meatball sub.

218
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Homemade.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't go to Subway.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't go to Subway or some shit.

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fuck quiznos.

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm a doctor.

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I do have to say, this is some not great dading.

224
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, I was about to say, I've only been a dad nine months.

225
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Henry right now has an ear infection.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
My initial instinct was not, oh, that's too bad.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going to make some meatball Subway sandwiches.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Meatball sub is a meal to take some prep.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You got to go buy that shit.

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You don't just have meatball sub fixings.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I've never thought, oh, my sweet boy is ill.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm going to make a crockpot based meal.

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Instead, I just leave town for five days.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I want to apologize because earlier Travis made it sound like Kevin's dad was never prepared

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
for things.

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And it may be that Kevin's dad shops ahead of time or maybe every Tuesday is meatball

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
sub Tuesday.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And he just hasn't read it.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Meatball sub Tuesday waits for no man.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Kevin, can you imagine if it's Monday and you start feeling bad and you're like, fuck.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Just snorting lines of emergency like I can't.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's tomorrow.

243
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Not today, Jesus.

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Kevin's dad is sitting bedside like, you're missing out.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Too bad.

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't break the chain.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
More for me.

248
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm going to eat yours.

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Save it for tomorrow.

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I wish I could, Kevin.

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But tomorrow will be Wednesday.

252
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sadly, Wednesday is dry cereal and flat Sprite.

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He missed it by that much.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Griffin, I didn't want you to miss out on your lifelong dream.

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay, I wanted to do something really quick.

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hold on.

258
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's working.

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah, Wonderwall.

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right, everyone, get ready to sing Wonderwall.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Absolute silence.

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He's not starting until it's quiet.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Make sure you get your phones out and get this on the tube quick.

264
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Shit.

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Start over.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Start again.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sounds like hot, hot, hot.

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They fucking stole that melody.

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:34,000
This is a long song.

270
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's an original composition.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Can I say my favorite thing about that?

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Called Theme from Rugrats.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He held his hand like a creature where this was the head.

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I was very scared.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And it was like.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So different.

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, there's different voices.

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This one's called Sneaky.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That was from Rugrats Knights.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Where it got a little racy.

281
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I gotta say, I haven't talked much in the last two minutes.

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I'd really like to work Griffin piano segments into every show.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It would only be the Rugrats theme song.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey, everybody.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Thanks for coming out tonight.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to play a little tune you may have heard.

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Can someone reach out to Klaski Supo to see if we can use that?

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, no.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This might never make it to air for legal reasons.

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Ask Mark Mothersbaugh.

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've killed the momentum of the live show.

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I love socks.

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I have almost 50.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The end.

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No, not in.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I love socks.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What do I do?

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I have almost 50 pairs.

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I'm even subscribed to a monthly sock delivery service.

300
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, nice.

301
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
My friend, you should stop.

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do they sponsor us?

303
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm assuming they would use the brand name.

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Unfortunately, I usually wear long pants in the colder seasons.

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And no one can see my great foot mittens.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't care for that.

307
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't care for that.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's not happening in case anybody's curious whether or not that's happening.

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Foot mittens is not happening.

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
How can I show off my neat socks while still looking cool?

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's from Super Sock Supporter in Central Jersey.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Are you here?

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Can I get verbal confirmation via Woo that sock mittens is not happening?

314
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're going to let it go.

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, it's happening.

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay, apparently it's happening.

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Sorry.

318
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They're sticking with it.

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Socks on the outside.

320
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of the pants?

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Of the shoe.

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You just jump right to it.

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not, okay, it's not the socks you're wearing.

325
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's the socks you're displaying.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, so you have two pairs of socks on, one protecting your foot.

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It is a one-off sock experience.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It is a bespoke sock experience.

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is sandals an option?

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No.

333
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I just wanted to pitch that hypothetical.

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The problem with cool socks is that they're only cool if they are discovered like an ancient

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
treasure.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You have to react to it like, oh, oh, yeah, I forgot I was wearing my hilarious T-bone

337
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
socks.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You can't be like, yes.

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If someone's like, oh, are those puppy dogs on your socks?

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, you shouldn't really respond to anything like that, Travis.

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not sure that observation is specific.

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Unless the question is, are you the murderer?

344
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, right.

345
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Did you bring the silver dagger?

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes.

347
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes.

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Is that a direct Poirot reference?

349
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Probably.

350
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
These motherfuckers have been talking about Poirot for literally every fucking conversation.

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm in the middle of Blue Train.

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Be cool, everyone.

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Don't spoil Mystery of the Blue Train, everybody.

354
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I skipped the big four because Justin tells me I don't have to listen to it.

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Travis said, apropos of nothing, can I skip the big four?

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's this all weekend, like all weekend.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Griffin was in the room, and Travis said, can I skip the big four?

358
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm on the Blue Train.

359
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And Griffin's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Are you having an aphasia?

361
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What are you talking about?

362
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I have a Yahoo here that I'm very excited about.

363
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We're not done.

364
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We're not done talking about fucking socks.

365
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't move away from Poirot.

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You don't want to talk about socks.

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You just want to talk about Poirot more.

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, yeah.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll talk about the, OK.

371
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Did we address the viability of socks over shoes?

372
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Thank you.

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Because I think people are going to see that and think, that's a fucking regal right there.

374
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right now, people love their shoes, right?

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You clean, you got those beautiful white Vans.

376
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You clean them when someone scuffs your Vans, right?

377
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's a thing.

378
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What the fuck are you talking?

379
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This is more incomprehensible than the Poirot chat.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm talking about damn Daniel.

381
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Didn't damn Daniel have, if you think.

382
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're talking about 2017.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You can't talk about damn Daniel.

384
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Damn Daniel turned 85, and he died.

385
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You can't talk about fucking damn Daniel.

386
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's September 2017.

387
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I like that Travis stepped on the thing I was saying to get in his great thing,

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and then looked at me like I'm going to cut the noose down.

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No, no, no, dog.

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You're going to dangle.

391
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're going to dangle while I watch.

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I had a joke in my head where the punchline was going to be Patch Adams,

393
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and you fucking killed me.

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You ruined it.

395
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I'm going to watch you dangle.

396
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Can you make your Patch Adams joke and pull me out?

397
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No, because it wasn't a joke.

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like 90% of things you say.

399
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It wasn't a joke.

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then what were you going to say?

401
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It wasn't a joke.

402
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It was something I was going to say with increasing levels of volume,

403
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and then say it like it was a joke, and people would laugh at it.

404
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Our formula, our whole pattern.

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's classic.

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
How about this Yahoo that was sent in?

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey, so stop.

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Holy fucking shit.

409
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's weird, right?

410
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because you're putting a thing on your foot.

411
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Seth Carlson.

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Thank you, Seth.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This Yahoo answers user Florin asks,

414
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Florin?

415
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can feeding take place via smell?

416
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
On a very small scale, of course.

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm thinking about the sinuses and mucous membranes.

418
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I feel like the...

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The end?

420
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

421
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, end of question.

422
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm thinking about them.

423
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I feel like the vibe of this show got very confrontational,

424
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and I'd like, in the interest of science,

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
if we could just rain it back a little bit.

426
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's all get on the same team and say that.

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And make fun of this person for their bad questions.

428
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

429
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We just talked about not being confrontational,

430
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and you just told me to hold on five times.

431
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But I said it...

432
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I thought I said it in a pleasant...

433
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Off mic.

434
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I thought I said it in a pleasant way.

435
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah, it was good.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was pleased by it.

437
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

438
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because here's the thing, like,

439
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you smell and you taste very close together.

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, those holes are right next door.

441
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They are face neighbors.

442
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It is connected.

443
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Let me hit you with this.

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You get a big bowl of soup, a big hearty bowl of soup.

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Soup, that's what I was thinking about.

446
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And you smell it, and it smells great

447
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because you got it from Panera Bread.

448
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We got any Panera Bread fans here tonight?

449
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's nothing.

450
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We don't have to do that

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
every time we reference a brand of any kind.

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The steam is coming up off the soup,

453
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and it's getting in your nose.

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What's the steam made out of, if not the soup?

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Like, everybody, the reason you didn't laugh very hard

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
at that great joke?

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're thinking about it now, aren't you?

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Right?

460
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're thinking about it.

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The steam is coming up off the soup,

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and you smell it, and it smells like the soup,

463
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and that's because there's soup in the steam.

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Because that's the thing.

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You might say, like, oh, steam is just water vapor.

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay, cool.

467
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Why does it smell like soup?

468
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Where's the smell come from?

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, that's weird.

470
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Thanks, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Nice try.

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because here's the thing.

473
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Imagine this.

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You put some soup on a burner, right?

475
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay.

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You leave it there for too long.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It dries out, so some soup went away.

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
How?

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Where'd it go?

480
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Huh.

481
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I guess it was in the fucking smell, right?

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But now this ruins it,

483
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
because now I get my big hearty Panera soup,

484
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and I set it down at the table and crack the lid open.

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The steam comes up.

486
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, my soup's getting away.

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.

488
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Soup escapes.

489
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Sid, can you get nutrients through smell?

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Uh, can you get nutrients through smell?

491
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Can you eat with smell?

492
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Can you eat with smell?

493
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
She says no.

494
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Sid, play with us.

495
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Sid, play in the space, Sid.

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Play in the space with me.

497
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh, shit.

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Please, Sid.

499
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What if you could get nutrients through smell,

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and every time you sneeze,

501
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you were losing nutrients from your body?

502
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Whoa!

503
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Whoa!

504
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Hold on, wait.

505
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You suggested that every time you sneeze,

506
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
you're letting smell out of your body.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah.

508
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Have you ever tried to smell a sneeze?

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I haven't.

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No, I guess not.

511
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It smells terrible.

512
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It smells like soup.

513
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, I had it.

514
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, here's the thing, Griffin.

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I was in a hurry.

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You breathe it in through your nose.

517
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

518
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Right?

519
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Where does it go?

520
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And that smell?

521
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Holy shit!

522
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're right!

523
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Sneezes have smell!

524
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Sneezes have smell!

525
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes.

526
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Excuse us.

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is a brother moment.

528
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Stop it!

529
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This isn't for you.

530
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This is for us.

531
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And you breathe in through your nose, right?

532
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Sneezes have smell, dog.

533
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah.

534
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
All right.

535
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This hasn't been entertaining at all,

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
but I've learned a lot about smelling.

537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
On the magic school bus!

538
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I shaved my head several months ago.

539
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No, you didn't.

540
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's the next question.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I shaved my head several months ago,

542
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and while I'm loving the hashtag bald girl life,

543
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
it's come with a unique problem.

544
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Every once in a while,

545
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
an intrepid stranger on the street,

546
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the kindest adjective you could use, by the way,

547
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I forget what's the question,

548
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
on the street will approach me and start rubbing my head

549
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
with absolutely...

550
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Boo!

551
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Exactly.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Thank you.

553
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
In their defense, it's a very fuzzy and inviting head,

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but like...

555
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't defend!

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't you dare.

557
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Attack them!

558
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
In their attack, fuck off!

559
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

560
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Am I wrong in thinking this is completely unacceptable?

561
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No.

562
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What should I do when a total stranger tries to pet me

563
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
like some kind of weird dog?

564
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And that's from Rosie, the razor in New York City.

565
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, is that you?

566
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Rosie, are you here?

567
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No, no.

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Are you here?

569
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
All right.

570
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah!

571
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
All right, here's the thing.

572
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let me ask you a question.

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay.

574
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If you had not shaved your head,

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and another human being on this planet

576
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
approached you like this...

577
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Like a fucking invasion of the body snatchers.

578
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Would that be okay?

580
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Absolutely not.

581
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No.

582
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's heinous, and it's awful,

583
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and I think the only thing you can do is rub their head back,

584
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
but like...

585
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But fucking...

586
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But fucking hard.

587
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Like...

588
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Here's the thing.

589
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If a stranger walks up to you and rubs your head,

590
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you could punch them in the face,

591
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and then if the cops are called,

592
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and it's like, what happened?

593
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That other person always has to start that story with,

594
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
well, I approached another human being

595
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and started touching them.

596
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So I was rubbing this person's head,

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and then, like there's no...

598
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The story's over.

599
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You're already in handcuffs going to jail.

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Do you know Taekwondo?

601
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If I might suggest...

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Justin, show us a move you might use

603
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
against a potential...

604
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, what's the answer?

605
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What?

606
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Travis is...

607
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

608
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Set it up.

609
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Travis will play the hair person.

610
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

611
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll be Bad Touch.

612
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Travis is Bad Touch,

613
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and Justin, you'll play the part of...

614
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The Touchy.

615
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The Touchy.

616
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Okay.

617
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well, but hopefully you will not be Touch-Ed.

618
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So here we go.

619
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah, I'll play by play.

620
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Stand over there a little bit

621
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
so I can actually see you both.

622
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
All right, here we go.

623
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So, Justin, what is he doing?

624
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Set the scene.

625
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's do like a...

626
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hey, everybody, let's take it to the audience.

627
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What's a fun thing for Justin to be doing?

628
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Painting.

629
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Painting.

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Vaping.

631
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Justin, you're vaping.

632
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So Justin's just vaping,

633
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and he doesn't have the hair,

634
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and Travis is looking at him vaping,

635
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and he's coming at him real...

636
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Hey, Travis, Travis.

637
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Hey, Travis.

638
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Three quarters for me?

639
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I can't see.

640
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Here we go.

641
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Open up a little bit.

642
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Travis is going,

643
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and then Justin chops the hand away with a fist.

644
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay, no, no, no, no.

645
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Stop.

646
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Hold on.

647
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Go back.

648
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're telling me...

649
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now I'm rooting for this guy,

650
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
because you're telling me that you tried to grab,

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and your hand got punched away once,

652
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and you were like, okay.

653
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's one.

654
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh, no.

655
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Now we're having a fight.

656
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
All right, so let's try again.

657
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Justin's getting punched, punched.

658
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
All right, now my brother's...

659
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Now Justin and Travis are fighting.

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay.

661
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Justin, when you hit my arm, it hurt really bad.

662
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

663
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I've never used TaeKwonDo like that before.

664
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That was an inappropriate usage.

665
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's part of my oath that I will never misuse TaeKwonDo.

666
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're out of the dojo.

667
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's sad in my...

668
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's not a dojo.

669
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Good try, though.

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Bigot.

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry I punched you in the tummy.

672
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's a...

673
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It doesn't matter.

674
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I just...

675
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I swore in my oath I would never misuse TaeKwonDo,

676
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and I feel like...

677
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Justin's going to be off for the rest of the show,

678
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
because he knows that he's broken his sacred bond.

679
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I feel like I might have misused TaeKwonDo.

680
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But you didn't, because look at how many people you made happy.

681
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay.

682
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Y'all promise never to tell Master Cruck at Tri-State TaeKwonDo

683
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that I misused TaeKwonDo.

684
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But Tommy did a great job, because my tendons hurt really bad.

685
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I didn't mean to hit you.

686
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm really sorry.

687
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I wanted to look good for the stage.

688
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Here.

689
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Do you want some ice or something?

690
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No, I've got beer.

691
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay.

692
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
How about a Yahoo?

693
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah.

694
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This Yahoo was sent in to me by probably 50 people.

695
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Thank you, 50 people.

696
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Louis, who asks,

697
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
anyone know a way to take hot sauce to school

698
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
without bringing the whole bottle?

699
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Is this what Beyoncé was talking about?

700
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
When she says she has hot sauce in her bag, just some loose,

701
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
some loose chalula just flowing around in there,

702
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
going hither and yon.

703
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You could hoop it.

704
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You could what?

705
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What?

706
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You could hoop it.

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's when you...

708
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Say it.

709
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You could put a bunch of hot sauce in a condom

710
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and put it up your butt.

711
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's have...

712
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm not proud of knowing.

713
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
No, nobody's proud.

714
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The risk reward on this for hot sauce is buck wild.

715
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I hate bland bologna as much as the next guy, for sure,

716
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
but I'm not sure it's worth anal torture.

717
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
How did he die?

718
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Well, he was rubbing this woman's head,

719
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and then the condom of hot sauce in his butt exploded.

720
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
She punched him in the butt, and the hot sauce exploded.

721
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyway, I guess law and order is out of ideas,

722
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
so this is our series finale, everyone.

723
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Get out of here, Ice Cube.

724
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm Dick Wolf, and I've been set free.

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You're free, Dick.

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I used my last wish to set you free, Dick Wolf.

727
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We did an episode where they talked about a condom

728
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
full of hot sauce in a butt exploding.

729
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
As an IBS sufferer,

730
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
this would actually be a pretty good, like, simulation,

731
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
just sort of as an outreach program.

732
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Can I just say how glad I am we do live shows,

733
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
because it's, like, the one time someone on stage

734
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
mentions having IBS and people in the audience,

735
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
like, yeah!

736
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Me too!

737
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, like you just dropped Brian Fellows or Mango.

738
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Like, oh, my favorite character, IBS.

739
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I packed my lunch in middle school,

740
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and for all three years...

741
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Did you hoop it?

742
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I hooped it every time.

743
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And I didn't do a good job.

744
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It was mostly bags of potato chips and star crunches.

745
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But I went through a phase where, fuck me,

746
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I just wanted some chips and salsa on the go.

747
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And so I would take a little Tupperware guy,

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
a little Tupper guy full of salsa,

749
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
locker salsa, I guess,

750
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that would sit in my locker for four hours,

751
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and I would have myself a little treat.

752
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And all of my friends would look at me like,

753
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
what the fuck are you doing?

754
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We have to be seen with you,

755
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and you have a Tupperware container of salsa

756
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
that you have sort of partitioned for yourself.

757
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
This is a thing, and I may have talked about this before,

758
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but the real is that now as an adult,

759
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
now as a 33-year-old legal adult,

760
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think about the fact that my lunch strategy was like,

761
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I took food, and then I put it in a room temperature box

762
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
for four hours, and then I ate it.

763
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Like, sometimes it occurs to me

764
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that I didn't have a refrigerator at my disposal,

765
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and it makes me retroactively sick.

766
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like, I have 10-year-old food poisoning.

767
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah.

768
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The idea that my sandwich with fucking meat on it

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
sat in a box for like five hours,

770
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and then I ate it like a monster.

771
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You know, Travis, you saying this reminds me of something.

772
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I want a munch.

773
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I want a munch.

774
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want a munch.

775
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I want a munch.

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I want a munch.

777
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I want a munch.

778
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I want a munch.

779
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I want a munch.

780
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Welcome here to Munch Squad.

781
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
There was so much more to that song than I remembered.

782
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
There was so much more to that song than I remembered.

783
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a big crowd, big show.

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We got to do a big Munch Squad.

785
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So if you point your browser to ta.co,

786
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
you're gonna find the Taco Bell website.

787
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,640
Wait, what?

788
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
Holy shit!

789
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,580
Wait, fuck off!

790
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,780
That's a Justin McElroy web address.

791
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,900
No, I wish.

792
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,060
I wish I'd had that foresight,

793
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,900
but they got taco.co.

794
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Did you just hide it from me?

795
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,820
No, I don't want you to look too quick.

796
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,540
Well, no, cause I'm holding the mic in this hand.

797
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,980
I saw a picture of the JPEG.

798
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,460
I saw the JPEG and I wished I hadn't seen it.

799
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,240
So Taco Bell has turned Breakfast Inside Out

800
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,980
with its naked egg taco,

801
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,780
which debuted on August 31st.

802
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,500
That was, this is a press release.

803
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,700
That was the most unappetizing set.

804
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,540
We took your favorite meal,

805
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,940
fucking turned it inside out with a naked egg.

806
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,780
Fuck, a naked egg is,

807
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm pretty sure I've seen the video

808
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,540
where you can hatch the egg without the shell

809
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,380
and you wrap it in Saran Wrap.

810
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,220
So-

811
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,520
Thanks BuzzFeed.

812
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,280
So it's a taco shell made of fried egg,

813
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,040
stuffed full of beloved morning flavors.

814
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,120
And it has apparently reinvented

815
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
the breakfast taco experience.

816
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,160
Okay, so-

817
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,860
Am I supposed to touch it?

818
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,220
Here's the first problem

819
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,120
that I want you to deal with in your heads.

820
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,160
Imagine a fried egg and it's a big ass circle, okay?

821
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,700
So imagine that and imagine someone folded it up

822
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,520
and then filled it with eggs,

823
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,920
more eggs, gross, and cheese.

824
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,540
Already I have a problem because if you take an egg

825
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,380
and fold it-

826
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,040
Just let me finish, please let me finish for one time.

827
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,900
This is literally my podcast.

828
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,200
Please stop talking to me.

829
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,360
So you take an egg, put more eggs in it,

830
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,200
then you put some cheese and some other items

831
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,640
that I'll discuss later and potatoes, I guess, and stuff.

832
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,940
And you fold it into a taco shape.

833
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,600
Can you imagine that for me in your heads real quick?

834
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,760
Okay, now in your mind's eye,

835
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,480
I want you to put it on its side

836
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,620
and realize that it's a fucking omelet.

837
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,440
Ah.

838
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,120
Taco Bell, you've done nothing.

839
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,920
You've changed adjacency.

840
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
You've changed, you've changed-

841
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,200
You've rotated a food 90 degrees.

842
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,680
You've rotated an existing food item, it's nothing.

843
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,040
But let's see how they make something into nothing.

844
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,640
No stranger to shell innovation.

845
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,780
Fuck you that that's even a thing.

846
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,960
Fuck you that that is a problem

847
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
that I have to deal with a shell.

848
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,480
No stranger to being a food pervert.

849
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,160
Taco Bell.

850
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,240
Taco Bell got real nasty on this one.

851
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,760
Taco Bell revealed its latest game-changing breakfast

852
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,840
offering the naked egg taco

853
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,000
created with a masterful shell.

854
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Fuck.

855
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,080
Okay.

856
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,640
Words mean nothing anymore.

857
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,480
Let me stop you because the problem

858
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,280
with the use of the word shell is

859
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,320
you know what eggs aren't?

860
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah.

861
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,320
Right.

862
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,240
Yes.

863
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,240
I've never picked up an egg and been like mm.

864
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Like it's floppy.

865
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,120
I think you meant to say I've never picked up an egg.

866
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,960
Period.

867
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,040
With your hands.

868
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,720
You don't do it.

869
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,540
So anyway, the naked egg taco creates a masterful shell

870
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,620
made entirely of a fried egg.

871
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,820
The naked egg taco flips the breakfast classic inside out.

872
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,800
Or on its side.

873
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,680
Or on its side.

874
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,520
Thank you Travis.

875
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,960
That's literally what they're doing.

876
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,400
The reimagined breakfast taco delivers a mouthful

877
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,520
of crispy potatoes, bacon or sausage and cheese.

878
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,040
Oh I just thought about putting it in my mouth

879
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,140
for the first time.

880
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,120
I just thought about the word reimagined

881
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,840
because that pictured people thinking about it.

882
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,200
People thought about it.

883
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,640
Oh guys I've got it.

884
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
The guy in question is actually Liz Matthews,

885
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,000
chief food innovation officer at Taco Bell Corp.

886
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,320
Can you imagine if that was your fucking job title?

887
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,460
Egg toucher.

888
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,160
That's too much.

889
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,320
Give me something nasty.

890
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,560
That's too much pressure.

891
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,480
I would go in day one like listen I can't get this nasty.

892
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,120
I know how nasty you want me to be right now.

893
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,260
I can't get this nasty for you.

894

Quote from Liz.

895
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,680
The naked egg taco strips down

896
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,280
the traditional breakfast taco.

897
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,280
The traditional breakfast taco.

898
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,560
It strips down your understanding of what it is to eat.

899
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,900
This ain't your grandpa's breakfast taco.

900
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,460
I live in Austin.

901
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,960
I actually have a very clear picture of what a breakfast.

902
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,280
No but I mean a tradition.

903
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,240
Something that needs to be subverted

904
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,880
and dare I perverted is not like,

905
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
it's not okay allowing us to deliver

906
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,200
a new flavor experience.

907
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,920
I mean that's a, that's true.

908
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
It's eggs.

909
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
Wait but what's the, oh hold on, hold on, hold on.

910
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,360
You can't say flavor experience.

911
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,200
No it's just an omelet.

912
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,020
The flavor is eggs.

913
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,860
It's eggs.

914
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,880
It's eggs and potatoes and bacon.

915
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,720
Shell innovation.

916
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,860
Well I've been there.

917
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,440
You didn't say like a meteor rock.

918
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,280
Okay.

919
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Like you're not bringing a heat.

920
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,600
And zebra face.

921
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,440
Okay.

922
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,560
Shell innovation is at the core of where we experiment.

923
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
That's fucking sinister.

924
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Can you believe that was.

925
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,040
Honey, honey how was your day at work?

926
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,880
I just can't.

927
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,700
I can't.

928
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,540
Crack it.

929
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,160
Wait.

930
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,740
What if you touched an egg like a nasty person?

931
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,640
Whether it's crispy chicken, biscuits or waffles.

932
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,520
Yeah fucking list your crimes.

933
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,160
Fuck off.

934
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,100
The wrap up menu item classics.

935
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,120
We bring our fans craveable and unexpected, fact.

936
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,480
Food experiences that leave them wanting more.

937
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,800
For the first time ever, this is where it goes off

938
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,640
the rails, dang.

939
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,840
For the first time ever fans at select cities

940
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,040
will have a chance to reserve a table inside Taco Bell.

941
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
Oh.

942
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,240
And taste it's newest menu item leading up

943
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,180
to the nationwide debut.

944
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,180
I believe you have a Travis on the, excuse me.

945
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,440
Nasty pink table.

946
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,680
Hey Jeremy do you have plans for Saturday at 10?

947
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,520
No I don't.

948
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,660
What are you thinking of something?

949
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,240
Would you like to get really bad diarrhea with me

950
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,800
and just have it for the rest of the Saturday?

951
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,120
I would love to get bad diarrhea.

952
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,200
Okay when you make that call to Taco Bell,

953
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,460
one, who's the poor person who has to answer that?

954
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,600
This is Taco Bell I guess.

955
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
You want a what?

956
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
Yeah, cause you're gonna have to have the conversation

957
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,640
with this poor employee who just started three weeks ago

958
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,800
that like no on that day they are in fact

959
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,640
taking reservations.

960
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,360
You have to try to sell them that bill of goods.

961
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
I'd like a table near the bathroom please.

962
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,960
Obviously, okay thank you.

963
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,760
And it goes without saying, table for one.

964
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,320
Can I reserve the toilet?

965
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,140
Slide it under the door, I'll be ready to go.

966
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,560
Events will kick off in New York on Thursday,

967
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,400
how'd it go?

968
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,740
We'll continue with experiences at Taco Bell restaurants

969
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,600
in Laguna Beach, Austin, Texas, good, good, good.

970
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,400
And Chicago, you just get in that reservation on your phone,

971
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,200
it's over, you missed it.

972
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,520
You get through open table.

973
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,920
Fans unable to score a seat are encouraged to follow along

974
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,560
using the hashtag naked egg taco.

975
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,760
Can you imagine?

976
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,900
Can you imagine, oh I couldn't get a table.

977
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,600
Oh I just have to see how it goes.

978
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,320
I gotta be there for every minute of it.

979
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,800
If I ever find naked egg taco in your search history

980
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,280
on Twitter, I'm going to put you in prison.

981
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,620
This is fair warning, you're going to prison.

982
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,460
Anyway.

983
00:43:52,460 --> 00:44:08,040
Hey folks, this is Griffin McElroy, just Griffin, thank you all for listening to our live show

984
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,680
from the beautiful King's Theater in Brooklyn, New York.

985
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,960
It was a pretty buck wild show, I don't know if you get this just from listening to it

986
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,840
but the King's Theater is like this huge opulent wonder theater where like 3000 people were

987
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:26,280
there and it was, I can't believe that they let us even into the theater, let alone perform

988
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,280
a show there.

989
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,000
So thank you all very much and thanks to our special guests, Lynn, Manuel Miranda, and

990
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,200
our other special guest who is going to be helping us out with audience Q&A here in just

991
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
a little bit.

992
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,160
Before we get to that, I got some ads to tell you about but before we get to the ads, I

993
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:48,080
wanted to say we have a show that we've added to our next tour, our Midwest tour in November.

994
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,600
On November 16th, Thursday, November 16th, we added another show in Chicago and there

995
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,100
are still tickets available.

996
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,080
If you want to see us in Chicago, just go to McElroyShows.com slash tours and you can

997
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,200
find ticket links there.

998
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah, that'll be next month.

999
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,140
Here this weekend though, we're going to be up in, or I guess down in Atlanta and Nashville

1000
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,320
so we'll see everybody there.

1001
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,720
I think there might be some tickets available for those shows as well so we will see you

1002
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,880
all real, real soon.

1003
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,400
All right, let's talk about our sponsors this week.

1004
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
Our first sponsor is Lyft.

1005
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,480
Lyft is a service where you get on your thing and you call a car, well you don't call a

1006
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,360
car, you just get a car on the application, like an application, kind of like Flappy Bird

1007
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,720
and then the car shows up and then you get in it and it takes you to where it is that

1008
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,320
you need to go.

1009
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,080
Nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating and they're the first rideshare

1010
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,200
platform with tipping built right into the app.

1011
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,840
If you're a driver, you keep 100% of the tips and they add up fast.

1012
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,780
So join the ridesharing company that believes in treating its people better.

1013
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:56,440
Just go to Lyft.com, that's L-Y-F-T by the way, you probably knew that, Lyft.com slash

1014
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,440
brother today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

1015
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,280
That's Lyft.com slash brother, Lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms apply.

1016
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,640
Also I want to tell you about Bowling Branch.

1017
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,840
Bowling Branch makes really fantastic sheets that when you sleep on them, when you wake

1018
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:19,360
up the next morning, you're taller and food tastes better and colors are more vivid.

1019
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,400
They said not to specifically say that it makes you taller and jump better and makes

1020
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,960
food taste better but I just, it's the damn truth.

1021
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,920
What makes these sheets unique is that each one is crafted from 100% organic cotton, that

1022
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,120
means Bowling Branch sheets not only feel incredible but they also look amazing and

1023
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,160
you're going to get twice the comfort and style at half the price.

1024
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,520
You can try these sheets for 30 nights and if you're not impressed, you just return them

1025
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
for a full refund.

1026
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,560
Just go to BowlingBranch.com today and you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets plus

00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,480
free shipping when you use the promo code MYBROTHER, that's $50 off plus free shipping

1030
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,080

That's New York City.

New York City?

1040
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,280

We share tickets to shows and podcast recordings, play D&D.

1046
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,800
Most of us started after Taz, thank you.

1047
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,480
We do monthly karaoke, eat and review crazy food in our Munch Squad, and throw events

1048
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:19,120
like a recent trip to be near horses at Medieval Times or our upcoming Halloween party.

1049
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,320
Tickets still available.

1050
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,120
It's a great way to make new, genuinely nice friends who totally get all your good, good

1051
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
McElroy references.

00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
This is a good bunch.

1053
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,000
This is a good bunch of folks and if you live in the New York area, specifically New York

1054
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,360
City, like the salsa commercial, then you should check it out.

1055
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,120
Again, MaxFun dot NYC slash join.

1056
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Got another message here.

1057
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,760
This one's for Heather and it's from James who says, Dear Hev, or Heath, probably Hev,

1058
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760
happy birthday.

1059
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,640
Thanks for putting up with my weird job and letting me travel around with questionable

1060
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,840
folks in these somewhat questionable bands and being there to pick me up from the airport

1061
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,760
no matter how shitty these Canadian roads are.

1062
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,720
Here's to many more of my bim bam picnics.

1063
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,360
I hope this non-surprising surprise makes your week.

1064
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
Love, JB.

1065
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,160
What's in my bim bam picnic?

1066
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
I gotta know.

1067
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,360
Are you having one right now?

1068
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,540
Watch out for ants.

1069
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,200
They're in the jelly.

1070
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
No!

1071
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,320
Get out of here, ants, dammit.

1072
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,840
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1073
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,600
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1074
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,040
It's a fantastic album that makes for a very spooky Halloween season, I guess.

1075
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,720
Thank you also to Maximum Fun for having us.

1076
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,480

1078
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,800

1081
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,880
Okay, that's it.

1082
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,980
I'm going to get back to the episode now.

1083
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,800
Thank you again for bearing with us for these live apps.

1084
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,880
I know it's not everybody's cup of tea.

1085
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,720
Next one will probably be either our live show from Atlanta or Nashville, and then we're

1086
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,920
going to get right back into, you know, making the sausage, I guess.

1087
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,400
I don't know why I put it that way.

1088
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,600
But yeah, Southeast, we're coming for you this weekend, and enjoy the rest of the episode.

1089
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,560
Bye.

1090
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,680
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

1091
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,220
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor.

1092
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,000
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

1093
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,240
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

1094
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,960
You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real people who have submitted disputes to

1095
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,180
my internet court at the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

1096
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,360
I hear their cases, I ask them questions, they're good ones, and then I tell them who's

1097
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,200
right and who's wrong.

1098
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,080
Thanks to Judge John Hodgman's ruling, my dad has been forced to retire, one of the

1099
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,600
worst dad jokes of all time.

1100
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,200
Instead of cutting his own hair with a flowbee, my husband has his hair cut professionally.

1101
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,180
I have to join a community theater group.

1102
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,800
And my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals.

1103
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,680
It's the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

1104
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:03,560
Find it every Wednesday at MaximumFun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

1105
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,160
Thanks Judge John Hodgman.

1106
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,880
That's-

1107
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,440
Should we move on to audience questions?

1108
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Yes.

1109
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
All right.

1110
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,320
So we've come to the point in the night where we take audience questions, first and foremost,

1111
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,680
there's one rule.

1112
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,160
So if you start your question with, this might sound like a bummer, but-

1113
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,000
We've been hurt before.

1114
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,280
But here we are in New York, the biggest little city.

1115
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
Is that right?

1116
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
No.

1117
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
Okay.

1118
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Beantown.

1119
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,280
And-

1120
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
That's Sunday.

1121
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
Okay.

1122
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,200
But here's a- What is it?

1123
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Big Snapple?

1124
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
Huh.

1125
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
That's weird.

1126
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
All right.

1127
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Move it along.

1128
00:51:52,200 --> 00:52:01,560
But in order to answer these questions accurately, we found ourselves in need of an expert.

1129
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,640
And so we brought an expert in, if he could join us now.

1130
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,720
Ladies and gentlemen, our dear friend, the smartest guy we know, John Hodgman.

1131
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:18,960
Do we have a fourth seat?

1132
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,360
Oh, we do.

1133
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Thank you.

1134
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,620
Thank you very much.

1135
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,840
Thank you for that big naked egg Taco Berg welcome.

1136
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,840
I'm so disappointed that you did not opt to sit at the piano, John.

1137
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,320
That was the visual I was hoping for.

1138
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
I don't play the piano.

1139
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,320
No.

1140
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
John, what have you brought with you?

1141
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
Well, John.

1142
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,840
Oh, just some copies of my new book, Vacationland, to be published October 24th.

1143
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,120
I brought one for each of you.

1144
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,120
Oh, thank you.

1145
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,280
And one for yourself.

1146
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,000
And one for myself or one for the- Would you just need me to sign this on the

1147
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
inside?

1148
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah.

1149
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
If you don't mind.

1150
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yes.

1151
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Just to validate my parking, please.

1152
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Thank you very much.

1153
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,200
I was hoping there'd be the bit in the middle, like they do in the novelizations of like

1154
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,520
Star Wars books, where there's like pictures of you just like hanging out, wearing some

1155
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
shorts.

1156
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,200
That'll be for the paperback for sure.

1157
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Okay.

1158
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,120
Wait, this isn't the paperback, John?

1159
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,120
No.

1160
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,080
These are advanced reader's copies.

1161
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,720
You can't get this shit.

1162
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,200
I'm selling this after the show.

1163
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,240
Can we get some house lights up, please?

1164
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,560
So I see the people have lined up.

1165
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,800
This is not how we usually do it.

1166
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Fuck it.

1167
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Let's roll with it because there's a lot of folks that-

1168
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
But wait.

1169
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Don't come line up.

1170
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
After they're done, we'll call.

1171
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
No.

1172
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
There's no way we're getting through these people.

1173
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
That's enough.

1174
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
Okay.

1175
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,480
In fact, count back five.

1176
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,480
That's probably good.

1177
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Go sit down.

1178
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,480
Okay.

1179
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,320
Let's get through as many as we can.

1180
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
What's your name?

1181
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,880
My name is Dee Stein.

1182
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Hi.

1183
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,880
Hello.

1184
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Hello.

1185
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,480
You guys, I think, went to high school with a good friend of mine, Brandon McCoy.

1186
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Yeah.

1187
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Oh, yeah.

1188
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Yeah.

1189
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
I did not.

1190
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
College.

1191
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
College.

1192
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
He just had a baby.

1193
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, great.

1194
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Yeah.

1195
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
His first kid, Shyla Mae.

1196
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
So I was hoping-

1197
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
No names, please.

1198
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,480
Sorry.

1199
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
I'll edit it out.

1200
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,480
As a bunch of sweet young dads.

1201
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,080
Do you have any pro advice besides don't drop shit on the baby's face?

1202
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:24,120
John, if you were to sum up all of your parenting knowledge in one sentence, what would it be?

1203
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,640
Don't talk too much.

1204
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,360
Let that baby tell you what it needs.

1205
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,520
Don't tell it what it needs.

1206
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
That's actually really good.

1207
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
That's good.

1208
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
That's so good.

1209
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,800
Especially when the baby can't talk anyway, so the two of you can just be quiet together

1210
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
for a while.

1211
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
Just savor the peace.

1212
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,040
That's the thing.

1213
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,840
Babies actually don't need that much.

1214
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,600
You think they do, but just wait until they ask you for something.

1215
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
You'll be fine.

1216
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,800
You know what babies really don't need?

1217
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Dads.

1218
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,900
Little babies.

1219
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,760
You will not tell all of our good friend from college.

1220
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,760
Brandon.

1221
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
Brandon.

1222
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,360
And what was the name of the baby again that you revealed without consulting your friend?

1223
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Shyla Mae.

1224
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
Shyla Mae Brandon.

1225
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Shyla Mae Brandon.

1226
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
I'm sure that's not it.

1227
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:14,800
Shyla Mae will not know or care that Brandon exists for about seven years.

1228
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:21,240
So Brandon should be watching as much series television as he can right now.

1229
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,240
Does that help?

1230
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,240
I hope so.

1231
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
Excellent.

1232
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,240
All right.

1233
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
Hello.

1234
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Hi.

1235
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,240
Hi.

1236
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
What's your name?

1237
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
I'm Nina.

1238
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,240
Hi, Nina.

1239
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,240
Wait.

1240
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Can I just say, have you all now just sat down in the aisle?

1241
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,240
That is so cool of y'all.

1242
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,240
We didn't want to block the view.

1243
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,240
That's so smart.

1244
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Thank you.

1245
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,240
Thank you.

1246
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,240
I appreciate this audience is so cute.

1247
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
This line?

1248
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,240
Right line hasn't figured it out yet.

1249
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,240
All right.

1250
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,240
Come on.

1251
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
All right.

1252
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Sit down.

1253
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,240
That line knows the score.

1254
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Hey.

1255
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Okay.

1256
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,240
So I dated a girl in high school six years ago.

1257
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Okay.

1258
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,240
Sorry.

1259
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
It seems like you just realized how long ago high school was.

1260
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,240
We're not going to know that better than you.

1261
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,240
I get it.

1262
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
For sure.

1263
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
Okay.

1264
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,240
And so I saw her-

1265
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
Are you looking?

1266
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,240
Are you looking up?

1267
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,240
When did you go to high school?

1268
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Click, click, click.

1269
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,240
Okay.

1270
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,240
So I dated a food lion when I was home for a day this August.

1271
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Okay.

1272
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,240
Okay.

1273
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
So she made me...

1274
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,240
The girl I dated, she gave me this necklace that she made before we dated.

1275
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
Okay.

1276
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Okay.

1277
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,240
And her friend asked me when am I giving it back.

1278
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
Oh, shit.

1279
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,240
Is this some dating protocol?

1280
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,240
I never-

1281
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,240
No.

1282
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,240
Am I?

1283
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1284
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,240
What?

1285
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1286
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
What?

1287
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1288
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
What?

1289
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1290
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,240
What?

1291
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,240
I just thought it was buck wild.

1292
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Yeah.

1293
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Buck wild indeed.

1294
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:46,040
What is your ex or anybody they will ever know going to do with the special necklace

1295
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,440
that she made for you?

1296
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,360
That is the most buck wild thing I've ever heard.

1297
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,560
Can I tell you straight up, no matter what the situation is, anyone who says, when are

1298
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:03,000
you going to give that thing I gave you with no agreement previous about back?

1299
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That's not a thing.

1300
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
That's not a thing.

1301
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
That's nothing.

1302
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
That's nothing.

1303
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Thank you.

1304
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,600
If someone says, I got this book for you, and then two years later is like, when am

1305
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,400
I going to get that book back?

1306
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,840
Hey, Nina, I got this book for you.

1307
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,200
It's called Vacationland.

1308
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Please don't throw it.

1309
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Oh, fuck.

1310
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Okay.

1311
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Would you hand that back to her?

1312
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Hand that back to Nina.

1313
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Hey, great.

1314
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Congratulations, Nina.

1315
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
That's good.

1316
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
Good read.

1317
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,400
Now, that's a very kind gesture.

1318
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,800
I'd like that back in three months, please.

1319
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Not now.

1320
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
No.

1321
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,000
That's called a gift, and I do not expect it back, even if we become mortal enemies.

1322
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,880
Thank you, Todd Huntsman.

1323
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
You're welcome.

1324
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,320
And he is planning on becoming mortal enemies.

1325
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,120
Don't get it twisted.

1326
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,920
Oh, Nina, and you know why, too.

1327
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,960
Do we help?

1328
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Yes.

1329
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
All right.

1330
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Hi.

1331
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Hi.

1332
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Hi.

1333
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,960
My name's Jack.

1334
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Hi, Jack.

1335
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,560
And over the summer, my best friend, he came out with me and some of my family to Montauk

1336
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,560
out in the beach.

1337
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Nice place.

1338
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,560
Nice place.

1339
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,920
If you can drive and are independently mobile, I'm not so much that.

1340
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,480
So it's kind of a sandy prison.

1341
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Can you do me a big favor?

1342
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
Yes.

1343
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,480
Can you turn your hat backwards like you're really cool?

1344
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Because all I can see is that there we go.

1345
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,240
There's a light shining perfectly down on you.

1346
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,360
And so it looked like you were headless.

1347
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,360
It was very.

1348
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,320
And I was getting scared that there was some sort of specter or ghoul situation.

1349
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Spook, specter, or ghost.

1350
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
Okay.

1351
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,920
So we were in a car with some of my extended family.

1352
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:51,800
And out in Montauk, there's this place called Gossman's Dock, and there's an ice cream location,

1353
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
a brand.

1354
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Am I allowed to say brands?

1355
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
You already did.

1356
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,800
You heard the bit about Taco Bell, right, my man?

1357
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
For sure?

1358
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Okay.

1359
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,800
Go ahead.

1360
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,800
All right.

1361
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,800
All right.

1362
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,800
So it's a Ben and Jerry's.

1363
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Okay.

1364
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,800
So we're in the car.

1365
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
We're planning to go to a steak for dinner, and then Ben and Jerry's after.

1366
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,640
And so my cousin mentions Ben and Jerry's, and my friend Noah, he turns to me and says

1367
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,520
what?

1368
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,480
And for the next, I shit you not, four hours, Noah maintains under constant interrogation,

1369
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,200
the pretense that he, a 20-something dude from New York City, has never heard of Ben

1370
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
and Jerry's.

1371
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
Okay.

1372
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
Okay.

1373
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Let me tell you something, Jack.

1374
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
He is fucking with you.

1375
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Yes.

1376
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Oh, no, no, no.

1377
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah, for sure.

1378
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
You were being...

1379
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
So we're in line after dinner at the Ben and Jerry's.

1380
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,200
Once he's standing in the Ben and Jerry's like, I don't believe this.

1381
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,720
There's no way.

1382
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,760
And he taps me on the shoulder and shows me a photo from his Facebook timeline of him

1383
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,120
and another one of his friends sticking their heads through a B-Ben and Jerry, Ben and Jerry's

1384
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,120
fucking dick.

1385
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:03,120
Oh, so he was like, he was like, that's the prestige, like, got you.

1386
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,920
So wait, what do you need advice on?

1387
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,920
Yeah, what do you need us for?

1388
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,920
How can I ever...

1389
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,920
How can I...

1390
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,920
How do you kill him?

1391
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
How can I ever trust him again?

1392
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
You can't.

1393
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
You've got your friend anywhere.

1394
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
You smother him in chunky monkey.

1395
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,920
Yeah, you gotta kill him with...

1396
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Hey, Noah.

1397
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Hey, Noah.

1398
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Hey, Noah.

1399
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,920
Noah.

1400
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,920
Fuck you.

1401
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
You're dead to Jack.

1402
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Yeah, fuck you, Noah.

1403
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
Noah.

1404
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
Noah.

1405
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
This is a weird turn for the...

1406
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,320
We've never done this before, but...

1407
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Fuck you, Noah.

1408
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
I guess.

1409
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,320
Thank you, Jack.

1410
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,320
Thank you.

1411
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,320
Thank you.

1412
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,320
Thank you so much.

1413
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,320
Yes.

1414
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,320
Hi, my name is Nadia.

1415
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,320
Hi, Nadia.

1416
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
Who do you want us to say fuck you to, Nadia?

1417
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,320
Who do you want us to burn down?

1418
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,320
It's apparently what we're doing now.

1419
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
Hey, the rest of this...

1420
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
Yeah, the rest of this episode, if you just want us to say fuck you to someone, fuck you

1421
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
to...

1422
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,320
This is our burn book episode.

1423
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,320
Yeah, this is our burn book episode.

1424
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,320
Who do you want to say fuck you to?

1425
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,320
Say fuck you to Tom.

1426
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
He knows who he is.

1427
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
Tom.

1428
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
Tom.

1429
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Tom.

1430
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,320
Tom, he knows who he is.

1431
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,320
Tom.

1432
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,320
Fuck off, Tom.

1433
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,320
Eat shit, dude.

1434
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,320
Tom, you know who the fuck you are.

1435
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,320
Hey, Tom.

1436
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,840
I'm putting Tom on my Nina list.

1437
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,520
Tom, everybody knows your game.

1438
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,520
Fuck off.

1439
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,520
All right, go ahead, Nadia.

1440
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,520
Sorry.

1441
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,840
All right, so when I was a child, I was...

1442
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Wait, hold on.

1443
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,080
Let's settle in.

1444
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:19,240
I remember summers at winter shims.

1445
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,040
When I was a child, I was very sensitive to horror movies.

1446
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,240
I would see a trailer and I would be horrified.

1447
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,240
I'd cry the whole night long.

1448
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,600
It didn't even have to be horror movies.

1449
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,480
It was mildly spooky.

1450
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,480
I'd be ruined.

1451
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
Don't turn around.

1452
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:37,240
There's a big skeleton right...

1453
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,120
No, you looked.

1454
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,800
Thank you to the person behind you who pretended to be a big skeleton.

1455
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,280
That was a tough improv that we gave you, but you reformed out of it.

1456
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,280
You ran with it.

1457
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,280
Oh, yeah.

1458
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,280
It's a Ghostbusters shirt.

1459
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,280
It's very wonderful.

1460
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
Okay.

1461
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,280
Okay.

1462
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,000
So I started getting very good at avoiding trailers, but then when I would see a horror

1463
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,640
movie poster, I would just wonder, what's the story?

1464
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,360
So I would Wikipedia the plot and...

1465
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,360
Hold on.

1466
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,760
Nadia, I'm going to let...

1467
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,120
Please let Nadia finish because this is only going to get better.

1468
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,720
I just cannot imagine.

1469
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,720
This is unfathomable.

1470
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,720
Please go ahead.

1471
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,920
And then, you know, I wouldn't sleep the whole night long.

1472
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,840
From the Wikipedia entries, I got it.

1473
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Yeah.

1474
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
That you read willingly.

1475
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,040
But then I learned, you know, not to do that anymore, so I had a few quiet years where

1476
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,240
I only slept badly because...

1477
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,760
I cannot wait for the elevation of your depravity.

1478
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,760
Go ahead.

1479
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:37,840
So I had a few years where I slept badly just because I have issues.

1480
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,560
Is she okay?

1481
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:47,560
But then, in the middle of August, I was at my job and I listened to podcasts while I

1482
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
work.

1483
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Okay.

1484
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
Uh-oh.

1485
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,160
And I saw in the little recommended thing something called the no sleep podcast.

1486
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,160
Oh, no.

1487
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,440
And then I thought to myself, I'm an adult now.

1488
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,160
I'll be okay.

1489
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,800
So I listened for the whole workday from 9 to 5, and I was like, this is great.

1490
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,840
This is a great podcast.

1491
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,100
I'm fine.

1492
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,720
And then the night came.

1493
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:17,320
This, I want to tell you, I don't know if this is a question or if this is a good podcast

1494
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
or anything.

1495
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
I'm fucking hooked.

1496
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
Yeah.

1497
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Wherever you're going.

1498
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,720
This is like S-Town, but on our thing.

1499
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,720
And then the night came.

1500
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,000
For those of you listening along at home, she's got a flashlight underneath her chin

1501
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,640
as she passes through.

1502
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,480
And then the night came.

1503
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,640
And then this is not a joke.

1504
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,160
I've had to pee for about 30 minutes and now I'm so spooked that it's going to come out

1505
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,520
of me if I don't run off the stage.

1506
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,880
But we have monitors in the bathrooms back there, so I'm going to listen to the rest

1507
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,880
of it.

1508
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,720
I promise I'll be back in time to give you advice.

1509
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
Just project.

1510
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,720
All right.

1511
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
Go ahead.

1512
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
See.

1513
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,720
So where were you?

1514
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:06,240
So, you know, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.

1515
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,320
What I want you to do is go into the bathroom behind him and when he's washing his face

1516
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,320
in the mirror, just go.

1517
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,320
Okay.

1518
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
And I tell you.

1519
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,320
All right.

1520
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,320
Everybody be quiet for a second.

1521
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,320
Let Griffin think the monitors aren't working.

1522
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,320
Wait, wait, wait.

1523
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,320
Hello.

1524
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
No, no, no.

1525
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,320
This is the water.

1526
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,320
And this is the well.

1527
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,320
Drink.

1528
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,320
Babadook.

1529
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,320
Do you do that on babies?

1530
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:39,040
We do that on baby monitors at home.

1531
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:43,160
We wait till the other one is alone in the room where the other end of the monitor is.

1532
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,160
We get real close to it.

1533
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Just go.

1534
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Babadook.

1535
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,160
We've taught Charlie to do it, which is adorable.

1536
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,160
All right.

1537
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Welcome back to the stage.

1538
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,040
I can go for another fucking hour.

1539
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,040
Let's do this.

1540
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,040
Okay.

1541
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,040
What's the question?

1542
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,040
How do I break this horrible, painful, yet pleasurable cycle?

1543
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:04,320
Let me help you stop listening to this podcast.

1544
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,040
You enjoy it, but it keeps you awake.

1545
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,600
Is that what you're saying?

1546
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Yes.

1547
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,120
So you either have to stop listening to this stuff and don't even read the Wikipedia page

1548
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,120
or just keep going until you're not scared of it anymore.

1549
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,920
Ooh, I like that.

1550
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
Immersion therapy.

1551
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,760
I get to the end of the podcast and find out.

1552
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,080
You have what Edgar Allen Poe calls the imp of the perverse, an attraction to the thing

1553
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,400
that you know is bad for you.

1554
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,400
Edgar Allen Poe's here.

1555
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
What's up, my man?

1556
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
That's right.

1557
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,680
Hey, dude, spooky books.

1558
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,120
You're never going to break this attraction.

1559
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,840
You have to work your way through it.

1560
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
Yeah, I like that.

1561
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,920
So I'll get you bored of it.

1562
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,240
So let's go see it this weekend.

1563
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,240
So does that help?

1564
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,240
Sing it with John Hodgman.

1565
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,240
Sing it with John Hodgman will fix it all.

1566
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,240
Just Paula McBeth.

1567
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
Yeah.

1568
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Thank you.

1569
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Hi, what's up?

1570
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Hi, what's up?

1571
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,240
Hi, what's up?

1572
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Hi, what's up?

1573
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,240
Hi, how's it going?

1574
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
Good, good, good.

1575
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Good.

1576
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
We're going to go quicker because we've got like five minutes left.

1577
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,240
I'll blow through this.

1578
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,240
Hit me.

1579
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,440
So I was at a comedy club the other night, and I went to get some beers from the bar,

1580
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,040
and I paid with a 20, got two beers, and I got like $16 in change back.

1581
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Damn.

1582
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
Whoa.

1583
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,040
All right.

1584
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,040
Where were you?

1585
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
1860?

1586
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,040
It wasn't good.

1587
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
Okay.

1588
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
Oh, the beer was bad?

1589
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,040
Yeah.

1590
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,040
Wait, but it was $2 beer, man.

1591
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Like, what do you want?

1592
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,040
Yeah, that's your fault.

1593
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,040
Anyway.

1594
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,280
So I got the two beers in one hand, and then I get my change back in the other, and I'm

1595
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,200
trying to put two ones into the tip jar.

1596
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Uh-oh.

1597
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,760
But I drop all of my money.

1598
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Yeah.

1599
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
Fuck.

1600
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,800
Thank you for doing this for me.

1601
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,720
Yeah, so then I-

1602
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,160
You've given me such an enormous gift.

1603
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,160
So then I reach my hand in the tip jar.

1604
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,160
Yeah, you did.

1605
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,160
Oh, hell yeah.

1606
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Of course you did.

1607
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,160
Yeah, you fucking Seinfeld motherfucker.

1608
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,160
Sure you did.

1609
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
I love it.

1610
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,840
Let's reenact my favorite Will and Grace plot next.

1611
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
I love this.

1612
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,280
I only wanted, like, my 10 back, so I come out with two ones.

1613
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,280
You're done.

1614
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,280
You're done.

1615
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,280
You're done.

1616
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,280
You're done.

1617
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,280
You're done.

1618
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,280
You're done.

1619
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,280
You lost the grand prize game.

1620
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,280
You got out, right?

1621
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,280
You stopped at that point, right?

1622
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Oh, no.

1623
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,280
Okay, hold on.

1624
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,280
No.

1625
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,280
The bartender looks at me.

1626
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,280
Oh, no.

1627
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,280
Yeah.

1628
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,280
And he asks what I'm doing.

1629
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,040
I'm making change for my 16, and then you walk out.

1630
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:26,160
And I struggled for an explanation and just dropped the two ones back in the tip jar.

1631
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Listen.

1632
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,200
Understand that that was-

1633
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,200
I want you to feel-

1634
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,840
There's no advice we can give you.

1635
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,680
We can just tell you, you did the right thing.

1636
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,880
You made a $16 mistake, and there's no way to fix it.

1637
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,960
It could have been a $14 mistake if you had just said two magic words, rubble, rubble,

1638
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,600
and then run out.

1639
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Yeah.

1640
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,600
Bartenders love thieves.

1641
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,360
No, you did right.

1642
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,360
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

1643
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,360
No, you didn't because you went back in.

1644
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,360
I'm sorry.

1645
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:02,560
You should have dropped the $16 and been like, ah, goddammit, and then walked away.

1646
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,640
You may as well have dropped them down a fucking sewer drain.

1647
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,640
Like they're gone.

1648
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,280
You could have dropped that $16 and then gone back to that bar for the next two weeks in

1649
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,880
a row and not tipped, and just known in your heart you're fine.

1650
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,880
You paid it backwards.

1651
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,760
You spent $4 on beer, a $16 tip makes you the most generous man in the world.

1652
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,680
He tipped more than 100%.

1653
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,080
The only shame is that you weren't like raising your eyebrows at them as you put it in, huh?

1654
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,600
That's actually the time where you get to look at it and go, next time when I say, do

1655
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,280
you know who I am, remember that this is who I am.

1656
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,120
I want you to remember this moment when I ask that question in the future.

1657
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
Have you been back to the bar since?

1658
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
No, not yet.

1659
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,280
Again, good call.

1660
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,600
You've made the right decision.

1661
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,440
Even though you did the wrong thing by going back in there, because that's a violation

1662
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:56,440
of the tips space, if you do that because you want to correct your error and the bartender

1663
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,880
says, what are you doing?

1664
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,880
Just tell them.

1665
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,880
Yeah.

1666
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
I dropped my money in there.

1667
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,880
They are also humans.

1668
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,880
No, I'm sorry.

1669
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,600
If I'm a bartender and you said, I dropped my money in there, I say, that's how it fucking

1670
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,600
works.

1671
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
True.

1672
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
True.

1673
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,600
True.

1674
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,600
True.

1675
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
True.

1676
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,360
Now it's across the magic threshold of the jug and then it became my money.

1677
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,360
You're right.

1678
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,360
Are we done?

1679
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,360
You know what you should do?

1680
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,360
You should cut your hand off.

1681
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,360
Yeah.

1682
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,360
All right.

1683
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,360
Perfect.

1684
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,360
What are you doing?

1685
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,360
You're right.

1686
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,360
One more.

1687
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,360
We got one more.

1688
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,360
Sorry.

1689
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Sorry, everybody else in line.

1690
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,360
This is it.

1691
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Hi.

1692
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,360
Hi, I'm Jessie.

1693
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Hi, Jessie.

1694
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,360
So I have a five month old kitten.

1695
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,560
When he was one month old, my mom trained him to drink only out of cups.

1696
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,560
Oh, hell yeah.

1697
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,560
And mugs.

1698
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,560
So now he's five months old and I still give him a bowl of water every day, but it just

1699
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,560
gets dirty.

1700
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,600
So I leave him mugs, but then when I pour myself a mug of like milk or wine, he tries

1701
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,600
to drink it.

1702
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,600
Yeah.

1703
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,760
What do I do?

1704
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,760
Enjoy that drunk cat.

1705
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,040
Yeah, you've got a good thing going.

1706
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:13,520
It is, listen, a cat's job is to retrain you.

1707
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,440
We have on our end table a cup for our cat that is always there.

1708
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,280
And we always have to explain to our friends, that's the cat's cup.

1709
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:32,240
And then one time a friend saw the cup and went, I'm parched and took a sippy sip.

1710
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,480
And then I could never talk to them again.

1711
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,600
Did he take a sip by leaning over and licking at him?

1712
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,440
You had another human being in your house who said, a glass of water I did not pour

1713
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
for myself.

1714
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,440
They also had a similarly sized glass.

1715
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,760
It was a classic parent trap mix up.

1716
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,000
This is true because I also have a cat who has strange water drinking habits.

1717
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,920
You can read all about it in my comic Garfield.

1718
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,080
And every time anyone cats it's for me, it is basically a 45 minute monologue on why

1719
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:10,480
you shouldn't fuck up my cat schedule of like, she'll drink out of that.

1720
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,760
Don't touch it.

1721
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,680
She drinks out of my dog's water bowl and my dog has just learned not to, not to, just

1722
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,680
not to worry about it.

1723
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,040
Do you, do you love that kitty though?

1724
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,040
Yes.

1725
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,040
Just let him.

1726
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,040
It's fine.

1727
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:35,920
You know, congratulations again to your mom for messing up your life one more way.

1728
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,920
I want to do one more.

1729
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
One more question.

1730
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
I don't care.

1731
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,920
Thank you.

1732
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,920
Thank you.

1733
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,920
I'm sorry.

1734
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,920
Thank you.

1735
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
I'm sorry.

1736
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,920
Hi.

1737
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,920
Thank you.

1738
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,920
Thank you guys.

1739
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Sorry.

1740
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
The timer's at two seconds.

1741
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Oh no, it's, oh no, it's coming up.

1742
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,920
Sorry.

1743
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
Go ahead.

1744
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,920
My name's Alpha Tay.

1745
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Hey, what's up?

1746
01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:02,600
I had no idea that you guys even existed until she told me about you guys.

1747
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Great.

1748
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
Just like the rest of Earth.

1749
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,440
And that is when they were conjured into existence.

1750
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,440
Right.

1751
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Pretty much.

1752
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:16,640
And, um, I just wanted to ask because Lin-Manuel was on earlier and I know that he sometimes

1753
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,760
raps and he's a person of color, so he's kind of like a brother, so he's like a fourth brother

1754
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,760
kind of.

1755
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,760
Sure.

1756
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,760
Yeah.

1757
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:34,280
Would you like to battle rap him for the position of fourth brother or at least, or if not that,

1758
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,640
at least for one of your books, John?

1759
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,400
You can rap to be me.

1760
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,400
You can rap to be Travis.

1761
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,400
I'm getting pretty tired of it.

1762
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,800
It's gone eight years now.

1763
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Lin?

1764
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
I don't know if he's still here.

1765
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,800
I think he left.

1766
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,800
Oh, you know what?

1767
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,800
Battle rap Griffin.

1768
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Hey.

1769
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Okay.

1770
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
Good night, everybody.

1771
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
Oh no, the clock has a big skull on it.

1772
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,800
No, no, no.

1773
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,440
I want to hear Griffin battle rap this gentleman.

1774
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,000
I'll just give this to you right now.

1775
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah.

1776
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Okay.

1777
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yes.

1778
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
You won a Pyrrhic victory against my brother in battle rapping, but hey, give it up anyway.

1779
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
He still won.

1780
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Griffin conceded right away.

1781
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah.

1782
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Shout out.

1783
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Shout out to all the other black Mbem-Bem fans.

1784
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah.

1785
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
What's up?

1786
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Thank you so much.

1787
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
All 15 of us.

1788
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:40,520
For the folks at home, Justin and I were literally knocked to the ground as if by a supersonic

1789
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
force.

1790
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Tactical blow.

1791
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,920
They self-taekwondoed themselves to the ground.

1792
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,920
Thank you.

1793
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,920
Okay, everybody.

1794
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,920
Thank you so much.

1795
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,920
Thank you.

1796
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,920
Enjoy.

1797
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,920
Thank you.

1798
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,920
Okay.

1799
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,260
So I have to get through these real quick.

1800
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:01,740
Thank you first to John Hodgman.

1801
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,960
Thank you to our dear friend Lin-Manuel Miranda.

1802
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,960
Thank you, John.

1803
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,600
He's great.

1804
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,240
Thank you to Still Buffering for opening up for us.

1805
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,240
Thank you so much.

1806
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,240
Yes.

1807
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,160
In case we didn't say it before, there are posters out in the lobby if you didn't grab

1808
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
one.

1809
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,160
Poster.

1810
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,160
Yes.

1811
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
We signed some of them.

1812
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,160
We did our best.

1813
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
We did our best.

1814
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,160
Thank you to Paul and Sam.

1815
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,160
Thank you, Paul, for helping us out.

1816
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,160
Thank you, Paul.

1817
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
Thank you, Sam.

1818
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
Thank you, everybody, to AG.

1819
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,160
Thank you, everybody, to this fucking beautiful theater you have.

1820
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,160
This is the craziest theater I've ever been in my entire life.

1821
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,080
Thank you for making it all the way out to Brooklyn.

1822
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,640
I didn't know that was a thing until New York people told me.

1823
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,640
We should also make it clear, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to do a meet and

1824
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,640
greet.

1825
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,440
We try to hang out after the shows, but we have an early-ass train tomorrow, and we have

1826
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,520
an hour to get back to our hotel because we're in the middle of Brooklyn, so we're probably

1827
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
just going to bounce.

1828
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
Yeah.

1829
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Sorry about that.

1830
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
Thank you for coming.

1831
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
We really appreciate you.

1832
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
We tried to say hey to some folks before the show.

1833
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,520
Yeah.

1834
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,520
We came by and said hi.

1835
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,040
Sincerely, this has been, like, so wild, and there's so many of you.

1836
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,040
This is our biggest show ever, and thank you.

1837
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,040
Thank you so much.

1838
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,000
Also, we should say, along with thanking John, Vacationland is coming out.

1839
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
When, John?

1840
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
October 24th, 2017.

1841
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Hell yeah.

1842
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Catch it.

1843
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,440
This is not a joke.

1844
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:29,800
If I can spend one second saying we grew up listening to John Hodgman's books when we

1845
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,240
went on our family vacations, I remember listening to—

1846
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,720
I'm extremely old.

1847
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:40,840
We listen to more information than you require going to Nashville with our dad.

1848
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,840
Pigeon Forge, remember?

1849
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,840
Yeah, Pigeon Forge.

1850
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
Pigeon Forge, too.

1851
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,640
And so it's really cool that he was here tonight.

1852
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,640
Yeah.

1853
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,640
Thank you, John.

1854
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,640
Thank you, guys.

1855
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,280
If you have never listened or read any of his books before, you should get on vacation

1856
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,280
with him.

1857
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,280
Yeah, he's a genius.

1858
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,280
Very kind.

1859
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:02,760
I am an only child, so I envy you guys, your siblinghood quite a bit, and I am glad to

1860
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,760
be here with you.

1861
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,320
Well, you just have to battle rap Lin, and then you can be our fourth brother.

1862
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,440
That is going to do it for us, Griffin.

1863
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,440
You have one final question for us.

1864
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,440
I sure do.

1865
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,880
Well, let's pick it.

1866
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,960
Every week, Griffin picks a Yahoo, and then we come back to it next week and talk about

1867
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:19,960
it.

1868
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,960
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

1869
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:29,400
Not true, true, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

1870
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,840
This was asked by Yahoo Answers user Captain, who asks, mad because my life sucks compared

1871
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,840
to Seth Rogen and Seth MacFarlane.

1872
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,200
My name is Justin McElroy.

1873
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1874
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1875
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,840
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1876
01:16:47,840 --> 01:17:17,320
It's your dad, Square on the Lips.

1877
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:25,400
Hey, you, with the headphones.

1878
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,000
Just between you and me, the MaxFunStore just got some of that sweet, sweet new merchant

1879
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
stock.

1880
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,200
You know, that merch from your favorite MaxFun shows?

1881
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:36,240
Could be posters, tote bags, shirts, stickers, patches, aprons.

1882
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
We got it all.

1883
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,240
Well, we got a lot.

1884
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,400
Point is, there's some new stuff.

1885
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:47,720
Go to MaxFunStore.com.
