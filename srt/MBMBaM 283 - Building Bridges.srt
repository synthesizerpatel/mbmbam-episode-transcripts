1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Gotta get up, gotta get up. Hello, everybody, and welcome. My name is Soul Legend Desmond Carter,

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,120
and you're listening to my brother, my brother, and me. It's 2016, basically.

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,360
Nope.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,840
And you've joined us for the 2016 naming special. Let me introduce you to the brothers you have

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,360
grown so accustomed to. First up is Justin McElroy. Hey, everybody, Justin here. Next up,

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
we got Travis McElroy. Oh, didn't see you come in.

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
Bringing the energy. Griffin McElroy, hit me. Hey, I didn't see you come in.

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
Shit. You stole that line from your brother, but it's 2016, baby.

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,640
Can I try again?

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
Yeah. Hit me.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,280
Here I come.

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,720
Very good high energy. Great special. So far, my brother, my brother, and me, every year,

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,840
they have chosen a nickname for the year. 2012 was, of course, ZzZzZzZz.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,240
20 Does.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay, 2010 was Zolo, correct?

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
2010 was Zolo.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,080
I don't know if we ever officially announced that, but in my heart of hearts, of course,

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
it was Zolo.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
I don't think they did 2011.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
That was Zole. We didn't know what we were doing.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,720
It took us a while to get good at naming things.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,200
Dark Lord Zole. 12 was 20 Does. Gettin' it in 20 Does, I believe was that one.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,440
Then in, of course, 2013 was 20 Dirt Teen. Digging up the dirt.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
2014.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
Was that 2014?

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,160
I think it's 20 Squirt Teen. Nobody remembers. 2015 was, of course, 2015.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:38,640
Colon, the con, is on. They were pioneers in inventing the idea of coloning a word.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
I just want to throw that voice into the sun.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Listen, one second, brothers. You paid me an exorbitant fee to be the emcee of tonight's

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
proceedings to have you leave this place immediately.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,840
I just, I'm almost done with my intro. Then I've got a few songs for you.

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Okay, I am sick of this shit and you have to stop.

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
It's making you, you are making me physically iller.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm trying to pick up your slack, middle brother. Here we go. Almost done with the intro.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,880
Big finish. Let's start the show.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,480
That was a big, that was a big finish.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Hey, so it's 2016.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,120
All right.

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
We got to come up with a name for it.

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
Can we review before we get to the naming ceremony,

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
like how grifty we got in this, the year of the grift?

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,160
We did a live show, a lot of live shows, and I feel like,

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,120
I feel like tricking people into paying to watch us sit at a table and make gooses.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Pretty grifty.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
That's true. And speaking of, thank you to everybody who came to our candlelight special

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,520
in our beautiful hometown of Huntington, West Virginia.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,080
We made a lot of memories, but based on what I saw on Twitter,

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
a lot of people made a lot of Huntington memories.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
And those are my favorite memories for people that obtain.

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,640
We also had special guests, things I bought at Sheetz there.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,480
And I asked, I specially had my daddy ask everybody to film it, put on YouTube, and nobody did.

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
So now it's a lost episode.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,080
If you were there, you got the lost episode of Things I Bought at Sheetz.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
And in case you're wondering, at the end of last week's episode,

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
when I thanked the Druids, that's because during Things I Bought at Sheetz,

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,800
there were Druids that kidnapped Dwight.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I lost to time.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
You should not have explained that because that was maybe my favorite moment in any episode

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
we've ever done where you just inexplicably thanked some Druids.

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
But oh, we, to Tino's, that was the ultimate con, right?

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
We've got them to pay us.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
I don't want to divulge numbers because according to our NDA,

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,600
we can't put like $500,000 just to talk about how fucking tasty the little pizza pillows are.

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,360
So should we decide what 2016 is going to be or each put out whatever our pitch is

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
and then let the people decide?

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
We don't need to gamify this shit.

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,920
We don't have to have one each.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
This is like fucking jazz, baby.

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,320
It's like a jazz baby.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's just hit some ideas.

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,440
All right.

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
And then we'll see if we can even stick.

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,760
20 flicks teen, catch up on that cue.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,760
Catch up on the cue, not bad.

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,960
Let me hit you with this.

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
This is a serious suggestion.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,880
2016, let's just get through it.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Oh man, no.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:21,040
No, if you go into you're thinking, fuck, let's just get through this one year.

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
And then some good things happen in it.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,920
You'll be like, whoa, not like you'll get to December and be like,

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,840
ah, that's as bad as I thought it was going to be.

87
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
Pretty good.

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
But I feel like that's a little too negative for what we usually bring.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Let me throw this out.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
This is my pitch.

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
2016, building bridges.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
That is very good.

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,720
What am I building bridges to?

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

95
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600
No, we're building a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Well, no, hold on.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Wait, 2016, getting it.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,560
No, 2016, build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a very specific goal.

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,200
Yeah.

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,240
But, and you're going to need to, I mean, a lot of these parts,

102
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
they don't sell at the home Depot.

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Could you also do Todd Bridges?

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
If that's more your speed, I don't see why not.

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
That's the guy from Sequest, right?

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
I think so.

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,040
If you build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges, what would it be called?

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Mine is dumb and hornier.

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
So don't try to steal that one.

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,440
That's pretty good.

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,640
20, what other words sound like six?

112
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,920
I mean, that's the root of this con-

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
20 mixed teen, get up in it.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
20 mixed teen?

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
Oh, get in the mix.

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,960
Okay.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
What does that look like?

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Practically, what does that mean?

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
Well, it's that idea of like, when you're like,

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,800
oh, I want to join that group, but like, I'm afraid that I won't fit in.

121
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
20 Dix teen.

122
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
Okay.

123
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm just saying Dix rhymes with six.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
I don't really have a-

125
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
Yours didn't seem as practical as mine did.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,200
No, there's no use case for 20 Dix teen, but-

127
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,240
No, I don't think that that one is a fertile.

128
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,760
We need something general, something universal.

129
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
Let me hit you with this.

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,040
20 Rix teen, where's all my Rix at?

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah, this is just for reaching out specifically to Rix

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
and Rix based listeners of this program.

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, sure.

134
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
20 Rix teen, where are all my Rix at?

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,200
So Rix, Richards, Rickeries, any like, variant.

136
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,720
Yeah, all my Rix.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Let me hear you.

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I had a math teacher named Rickery Smith.

139
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
No, you didn't.

140
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,840
I did.

141
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,880
He taught me good math.

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,280
20 Twix teen, get those caramel-y sons of bitches.

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,920
I like that.

144
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,360
20 Hix teen, back to your roots.

145
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
I like back to your roots.

146
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
I like the idea.

147
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,080
Yeah, okay, let's start from the practical application

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
and then work backwards to the word.

149
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Because right now we're just saying

150
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
a bunch of gobbledygook garbage.

151
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,600
And I want it to have a meaty thing.

152
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
People this year were on their grift

153
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,240
and that was because of us.

154
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
I want there to be a use 20.

155
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
What do we want people to do this year?

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,320
Love one another.

157
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,520
Just love one another.

158
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Hug more.

159
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,400
Hug more.

160
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
Hug more.

161
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
Score lots of babes.

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
20 chicks teen.

163
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,080
No, Justin.

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
Come on, ladies.

165
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,040
Pile in this Lamborghini.

166
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,600
Which one?

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,880
This one.

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,360
This one.

169
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
No, not that one.

170
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,840
That's not mine.

171
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
Hop in the backseat, baby.

172
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
There's no backseat.

173
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a Lambo.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
20 Pix teen, or it didn't count.

175
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
You're like saying take lots of pictures?

176
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,600
I guess.

177
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,160
Right now I'm just trying to think of things

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
that sound like six.

179
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
Well, let me hit you with this then.

181
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
20 Fricksteen.

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Hey, Hollywood.

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,440
It's time to let Brenda Fricker back into movies.

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,760
Listen, what she did, I'm not here to excuse it.

185
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
It was heinous.

186
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,440
What she did, it's inexcusable.

187
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,400
But it's time.

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
She served her time.

189
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,280
And it's time to let her back into the picture.

190
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
20 Fricksteen back in the picture.

191
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
What about 20 Nix teen?

192
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Cut it out.

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Cut it out, Hollywood.

194
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,880
Let her back in.

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,840
Wait, I really like 20 Nix teen.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,800
20 Nix teen is like, just cut it out.

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
Because everybody's got something

198
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,840
that they just want to stop doing.

199
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,880
And they always complain.

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
Like, it's the thing that people are making.

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
Like, I wish I could stop blank.

202
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
You can.

203
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
Yeah, there's Nix teen.

204
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
It's time to stop.

205
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
I like Nix teen too because it has other applications.

206
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
For instance, if the basketball team, the Knickerbockers,

207
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
do like a lot of good dunks

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
and they win the basketball championship,

209
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,760
then it can be like of the year,

210
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,720
then be like, hey, we knew it.

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
Also, I'm planning on getting very into Fleetwood Mac this year.

212
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
So that would also work for me in that regard.

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Maybe you're a big fan of Richard Milhouse Nixon.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, another possibility.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,560
But wait a minute.

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
The Nix, if it's 20 Nix teen,

217
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
then you can get real into Mick Fleetwood.

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,280
So you have a lot of different options

219
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
regarding Fleetwood Mac.

220
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
Well, this is great.

221
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
We'll just keep it 20 Nix slash Nix teen,

222
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
depending on what key you hit on the keyboard.

223
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
I think I want people to chase their passions.

224
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
That's what I want for this year.

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
I've just decided.

226
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Okay.

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
A lot of people are just sort of stuck in a rut

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
doing their same thing,

229
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
sort of suspending this thing that they want to do.

230
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
Either some sort of creative vision,

231
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
a romantic vision,

232
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
whatever they know they're going to get to eventually.

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,120
But guess what?

234
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
You're putting it off a little too long.

235
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,480
So I want people to really jump at it.

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,720
Okay.

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,480
Well, how do you translate that to a pun?

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,920
What about this?

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,680
20 Qix teen.

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
Don't wait up.

241
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Wait.

242
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, I thought you were going for like a Qixotic kind of thing.

243
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
That could be it too.

244
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
20 Qix teen.

245
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Don't wait up.

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,280
It's all about like, stop delaying your shit.

247
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,520
Mm-hmm.

248
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,720
And move quickly.

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,880
What about 20 Stix teen,

250
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
appreciating the music of the world's greatest rock band?

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
See, I feel like that's not as good.

252
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
Okay.

253
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
20 Thix teen.

254
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
It's time we forget.

255
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
No, it's not time we forgive Thicc.

256
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
Thicc, you're still in the dog house, buddy.

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
I think 20 Fix teen building bridges

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
is probably as good as it's going to get.

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,680
And I like the idea of coming back and doing something nice

260
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,760
after this year, this selfish year of self-satisfaction

261
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
at the expense of other people, like Totino's.

262
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,840
We like to give all of Linear Time a narrative arc.

263
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,160
Right.

264
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,680
So this is, it just had sort of a dark turn, a heel turn.

265
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,080
Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,280
Now it's time to make a face turn, a positive year.

267
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,840
So just like a sneak preview, what are you guys planning on?

268
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,480
What bridges are you building personally?

269
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
I've had a running feud with Elliot Kalin.

270
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm probably going to squash that beef.

271
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,800
Over what?

272
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Well, I think he's the greatest.

273
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,840
Okay, so that's a bad bridge.

274
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,960
That's like, you have teleportation pads between you.

275
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,320
You don't need a bridge, it sounds like.

276
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,280
Okay, that's fair.

277
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,080
Justin, bridge.

278
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
Can I make a suggestion?

279
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,240
Maybe this is the year that we finally patched things up

280
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
with jugglers.

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Ooh, we've had a long sort of, it's been a rough few years

282
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,400
between us and jugglers, but mainly because their hobby is...

283
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Ridiculous.

284
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,800
It's ridiculous.

285
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,760
Those things are supposed to be on the ground or on shelves,

286
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
or you're supposed to hold one of them at a time,

287
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
maybe two tops.

288
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
It's only impressive to like feudal kings from hundreds of

289
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,440
years ago, we have the internet now, and we have no need of you.

290
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,320
That's the only problem with jugglers is that they're wasting

291
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
their time and our time, and sometimes people get hurt

292
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
with those things.

293
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,480
Yeah, so that's been our stance so far.

294
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
What I'm saying is like, maybe we just reach out to jugglers

295
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
this year, just try to work it out.

296
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
Well, it's not 2016 yet.

297
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeah, we still have two more days to just fucking hate

298
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
those guys.

299
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,360
I will say I see a path forward because I saw that YouTube

300
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
video of that guy standing in a cone and like juggling shit

301
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
like around the cone around himself.

302
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,400
And I was like, all right.

303
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
All right, I see what you're doing here.

304
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,400
We can talk about that.

305
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
We can figure something out here.

306
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,280
You may have some place in the internet age yet, jugglers.

307
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,440
So that guy, I guess, is going to be the keystone

308
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,480
and my beautiful bridge.

309
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
So if you're a juggler, maybe we could have like a juggler

310
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,640
Gesper, who's like a sick juggler.

311
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
I could reach out to cone guy.

312
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm sure there's a contact info out there somewhere.

313
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,560
Problem is, I feel like, you know, he talks like,

314
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,960
why would every juggler?

315
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,680
Why do they all sound?

316
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
Why do they sound like that, though?

317
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,840
Are you a ball and another ball there?

318
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,440
I can hold them all at once.

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,940
Juggler.

320
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
That's all they all sound.

321
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
They do all say juggler a lot.

322
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
They do say juggler.

323
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
Juggler, do you juggly do?

324
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Now it's time for juggler.

325
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,880
That's actually something I like if you move a muscle.

326
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,200
Well, they start this little incantation.

327
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
They're like, no way, come back.

328
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,560
I worked real hard at this and I need you to ingest it.

329
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,060
Yeah.

330
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
Are they all kind of sick?

331
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
What's going on with their actual tone and meter of their voice?

332
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Their approach to social interaction has become warped

333
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,600
from hours, if not days, of hiding in a darkened room

334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
and throwing balls up in the air and catching them.

335
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
So they've forgotten how people talk.

336
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, that makes sense, actually.

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
Now that I think about it, let's do some advice

338
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
now that we're down with 2016 building bridges.

339
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm just saying I like the theme we're going with,

340
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,600
but if I do build a sex dummy of Jeff Bridges.

341
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,920
That actually counts towards the original goal.

342
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,420
Okay.

343
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,480
If I use this sex dummy to cross a small gap.

344
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Well, actually, Jeff Bridges publicly stated the other day

345
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,600
that he was sad that no one's ever made a sex dummy of him.

346
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
Well, I'm saying it would serve two functions.

348
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
One, I would fuck the shit out of it.

349
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah.

350
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Number two, I have a small creek in my backyard

351
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,360
that I can lay him over and cross from one side to the other,

352
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,400
cross the gap safely.

353
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,400
So-

354
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,080
Untouched by creek water.

355
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Travis, how do you feel, my friend?

356
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
I feel like shit, Justin.

357
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
Let's just do the show.

358
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
I know, I'm just trying to be-

359
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
I want to be honest about the conditions

360
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
to earn ourselves some goodwill.

361
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,720
Okay.

362
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,760
This is true.

363
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,960
There is a very good reason we weren't able to record on Monday.

364
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Yeah, and a good reason why this episode's probably gonna be pretty short

365
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,640
is because we're all fucking just disintegrating.

366
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, and my baby has an incredibly high fever

367
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
and has for eight days.

368
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,040
Everything sucks.

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
Like, I'm over it, baby.

370
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
Let's help people.

371
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,600
Help us.

372
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,720
Fix us.

373
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
I work in an office,

374
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,960
which involves writing letters to people.

375
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
Down the office, walk to coworker-

376
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,280
Whoa, this is like a tense shift.

377
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,880
I'm not used to these in the questions.

378
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,360
Hell yeah.

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Down the office, walk to coworker who has her sexy so right.

380
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,160
Oh, nice.

381
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,520
And we made eye contact,

382
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,400
as is polite under normal circumstances.

383
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,960
Nope, nope, you're slipping.

384
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,760
Thank you all for having me for this guess question.

385
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,880
I did a little smile, however, this was wrong.

386
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,720
At the time we made eye contact and I smiled,

387
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,240
I happened to be licking an envelope to seal it shut.

388
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Oh, no.

389
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
She looked terrified.

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
Yes, correct.

391
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,080
I think she may think I was smiling at the thought of licking her.

392
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,840
2016?

393
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,240
No.

394
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,520
How do I convince her it was an accident and I'm not a creeper?

395
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,760
That's from skeezy and salivating in Sheffield and the ship has sailed, my friend.

396
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Too late.

397
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Shit, I'm going to print this email out and put it in the garbage can.

398
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
The garbage can.

399
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,520
This is actually, I think, one of the examples shown in every HR video

400
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,000
when you first get hired at any job of like what not to do.

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
Please don't do this.

402
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,200
I guess, fellas, I don't want to get blue here,

403
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,600
but there's a very, there's a vitally important piece of information

404
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
that we are lacking when trying to picture this image mentally.

405
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,800
And that was, and again, I don't want to get blue,

406
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
but what was the orientation of the envelope while you were licking it?

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
Because if it was one way, I could write it off as an accident.

408
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,960
But if it was the other way, was it an accident?

409
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
You dirty bird, you dirty envelope bird.

410
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah, I think that this is done.

411
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,440
If you turnt that shit 90 degrees, I'm saying,

412
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,400
and you have fucking cherry pie playing on Spotify,

413
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,800
then I can't, it's inexcusable.

414
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,640
And I'm going to put you in the fucking fricker jail because that sucks.

415
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
That's no, that's no good.

416
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,840
No good.

417
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,120
Is it possible?

418
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Is there a chance that this moment registered with this woman

419
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,040
and then it was gone?

420
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,520
How do you mean?

421
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,200
Like, she's not thinking about this nearly as much as the question, Oscar.

422
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,160
That's, Travis, impossible because I want you

423
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,720
and I want everybody listening to simulate this right now

424
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
using their actual face, okay?

425
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
I want you to pretend you're making eye contact with somebody,

426
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
but this is the more important part.

427
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,000
I want you to smile with your mouth

428
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,200
and also try to lick something at the same time.

429
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,840
Oops.

430
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh, yeah, you're right.

431
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
Uh-oh, you look like venom.

432
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,800
No, you done fucked up real, real bad.

433
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,640
Oops-a-daisy, you look like venom.

434
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
The problem here is that you can't go talk to her now and be like,

435
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
hey, yesterday when I was licking the envelope,

436
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
I wasn't thinking about you or anything.

437
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
Like, there is nothing you can say to make it less creepy.

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
You will only make it more creepy.

439
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do for you

440
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
at this moment except to just sort of like,

441
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,400
I can pass on my personal sort of style,

442
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,960
which is all of this could have been avoided,

443
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
or at least mostly avoided if you just hadn't made eye contact.

444
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
If you just hadn't made eye contact with her

445
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,960
or anybody else for the rest of your life.

446
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
Why were you trying to make eye contact with people

447
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
while licking an envelope?

448
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
Your eyes should be down.

449
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
Right, that's bad in the first place,

450
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
but your eyes should always be down no matter what,

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
because then you still would have been doing that crazy thing

452
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
with your mouth, and I hate that.

453
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
But at least you wouldn't have been like fucking nose scoping

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
at this woman.

455
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,760
Are we agreed that like, I've been racking my brain.

456
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
I have nothing.

457
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
You're hosed, right?

458
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
You gotta like brush up your resume.

459
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,520
Okay, you should be happy you still have a job.

460
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah.

461
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,360
Forget trying to salvage a relationship with this person.

462
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
You're employed.

463
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeah, it's bad.

464
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
It's not great.

465
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,080
It's not great though.

466
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
It's not a great, like the whole situation's pretty bad.

467
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,560
What you gotta do is you gotta lean into it.

468
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Uh oh.

469
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
And the next time she comes back down the hallway,

470
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
grab the closest envelope, go to town.

471
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,280
Yeah.

472
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:10,880
God.

473
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,680
Then you can just try to convince her that you have pica,

474
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,720
and you need like some of the nutrients in there

475
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
to be able to function as a person.

476
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,840
Do you guys think, how much money would you pay me

477
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,360
if as a dare, I licked envelopes at a 90 degree angle

478
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,400
for a whole year?

479
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
I guess it wouldn't matter because I work from home.

480
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
It's not like anybody would observe the act.

481
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,040
But what if I went to the post office every day

482
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,880
and did it in like face to face with the post office employees?

483
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,400
And I was just like, what?

484
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
That's how I make sure they get real good and sealed up.

485
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,280
This is how I seal my packages.

486
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
I don't know.

487
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,680
I wouldn't pay you to do that.

488
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,960
Yeah.

489
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
It'd be like, I love you.

490
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:54,720
Yeah.

491
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,920
But it'd be like a fun, like wild boys stunt.

492
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
No, it sounds terrible.

493
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
It sounds mean to the post office employees.

494
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,680
I guess so.

495
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,960
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

496
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Yes, please.

497
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,080
And sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

498
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,720
Zoe Kinski.

499
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,440
She posted in the MBM appreciation group on Facebook,

500
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,320
which is a great group.

501
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,360
If you're not a member of it,

502
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
they did a candle night secret Santa exchange.

503
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
And she posted, she got a custom made shirt

504
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,160
that says climbing that ladder on it,

505
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,360
which made me very happy.

506
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,760
That's cool.

507
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,320
Yeah.

508
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,800
Thank you, Zoe.

509
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andres, who asks,

510
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
does dressing up as Tommy Pickles

511
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
get you a five day suspension from school?

512
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,200
What?

513
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
In my high school, we have things called spirit.

514
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,560
Oh no.

515
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,880
In my high school, we have things called, sorry.

516
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,920
In my high school, he have things called spirit weeks.

517
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,440
Where based on what the theme is,

518
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,400
the students come dressed as said theme for spirit points.

519
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
And whichever class gets the most points

520
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
wings a free trip to King's Dominion.

521
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
That's pretty sweet.

522
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah, that's actually pretty dope.

523
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
Apparently on a Thursday seniors had to go as 90s Nickelodeon.

524
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,560
I went as Tommy Pickles.

525
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,360
During lunchtime, I got up and walked over to the table

526
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,640
with the singing sheets.

527
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
Sign in sheets?

528
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,960
What?

529
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,920
I like singing sheets because it makes their whole school

530
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,760
sound like an Arthurian legend.

531
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

532
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,160
Since I was wearing only adult diapers and a blue shirt,

533
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,680
the whole cafeteria saw that.

534
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,320
And the principal that gets me a five day suspension.

535
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
Everyone keeps saying the punishment was too rash

536
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
and so do I.

537
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
So I ask, is it?

538
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
PS, I didn't come to school in diapers.

539
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,240
I changed in a nearby bathroom.

540
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
Everyone is saying it was a first time dress code violation,

541
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
which results in a warning

542
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
and to be sent home for the rest of the day.

543
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Okay, he says everyone saw that.

544
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,720
He means his balls and penis, right?

545
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
Yeah, he pulled out his whole penis

546
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
and both his big juicy balls.

547
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Listen, I understand that this is a first time dress code

548
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,000
violation and I am admittedly not someone

549
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,720
who is overseeing your school in a rules fashion.

550
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,760
You can violate the dress code.

551
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
There are violations of dress code

552
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
and then they're showing up in an adult diaper.

553
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,600
Yeah.

554
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
Like you don't get off with a warning for that.

555
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,880
Like that implies that you were somehow misled

556
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,800
about the specifics of the dress code.

557
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,320
Well, a bigger problem is he made it to lunch

558
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,920
before he got in trouble.

559
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,640
That's, yeah.

560
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
Well, he had a big audience there

561
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
and you know this motherfucker was putting on a show.

562
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,200
But Justin has a great point.

563
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
It's not like everybody gets one free pass

564
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
to get out their dick and balls or vagina

565
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,520
and then be like, oops, that's my one.

566
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll go put my pants on.

567
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,320
Like, no, there's some violations are so severe

568
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,200
that you have to be given the maximum punishment.

569
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,880
Like right away.

570
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,360
Right away.

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
By which I mean death.

572
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
You have to be, wait, you have to be killed?

573
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,960
No, sorry.

574
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes, maybe a wolf school.

575
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,720
By the singing sheets.

576
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
Singing sheets, they spirit your soul away.

577
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
You must march through the singing sheets into wolf school.

578
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
It's really bad in there.

579
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:00,960
Okay.

580
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Why do they kill you in wolf school?

581
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
I don't know.

582
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,840
But why have his teachers failed him so badly?

583
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,680
Why have all the other people, are they just afraid?

584
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,400
Whoa.

585
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,040
Well.

586
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,200
Did he just, did he just intimidate

587
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,920
an entire school of people into submission

588
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
by wearing a diaper?

589
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,960
Was that like such-

590
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
You mean like it was so intense they couldn't handle it,

591
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,440
they had to remove them?

592
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
Such a big move that he made?

593
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
It made such a big move.

594
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,520
That's way too cool.

595
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,640
Get him out of here.

596
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
My favorite thing about this story is like,

597
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,040
the Rudy-esque like collabo that all the other,

598
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
the whole rest of the student body is doing,

599
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,920
where they are like,

600
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,160
I don't know, Mr. Adkins,

601
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,240
that punishment seems really harsh.

602
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
This one's for Tommy Pickles.

603
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
If he's suspended, I'm suspended too.

604
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Walk out, gang.

605
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,000
We're having a walk out.

606
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,480
Because high school-

607
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
We're having a crawl out.

608
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,760
Yeah.

609
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,880
High schoolers need like no reason to have a walk out.

610
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
It's like, yeah, we'll protest.

611
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,120
What are we protesting?

612
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,600
Whatever.

613
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,800
We all are leaving school, right?

614
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,760
They can't punish all of us.

615
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Or they all show up the next day

616
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,240
in diapers.

617
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
In diapers, yeah.

618
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,040
Also, I love that idea.

619
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,280
I think there are a couple different times at Huntington High

620
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
where someone tried to like,

621
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
encourage everyone to do a walk out

622
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,800
and dude, like they can't punish all of us.

623
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
And now looking back,

624
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,120
all I can think is if I were like a high school staff member

625
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,160
and all the kids just weren't there one day,

626
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
but I was still there getting paid,

627
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,640
that would be like the best day.

628
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,280
Yeah.

629
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,720
I would just get drunk.

630
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
That would be like a top-notch day.

631
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,280
I would get drunker than I usually am on a given school day.

632
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,160
That would be a great day,

633
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,800
except you're still like legally on the hook

634
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
for whatever happens to those kids.

635
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,240
I don't think that's how that works.

636
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,120
No, that's not true.

637
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,880
Like if a kid stays home sick,

638
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,800
you don't have to like go down and make sure

639
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,480
that they don't like rob somebody.

640
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,120
That's different.

641
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
They're playing hooky.

642
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
Their parents think they're at school.

643
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,320
You think they're, you know, at home,

644
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,640
you're on the hook for that as a school.

645
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,280
What if there was a school-wide walk out

646
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,040
and also a zoo-wide bear walk out

647
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,400
and all the bears left the zoo at the same time,

648
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
the students all left,

649
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
and then the two groups met in the middle.

650
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
Who's on the hook for that, I ask you.

651
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah, that's a good point, Justin.

652
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm gonna read the best answer on this

653
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
is a Yahoo Answers user

654
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,640
and fucking legal expert father who responds.

655
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,440
This is kind of tough, but honestly, the answer is yes.

656
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,160
Think about it.

657
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,440
You essentially came to school

658
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,000
in nothing but underwear and a t-shirt.

659
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,920
You really should have used a little foresight,

660
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,720
like wearing pants underneath or at least a pair of shorts.

661
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,760
Hi, father.

662
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,480
Hi, daddy.

663
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,440
Have you seen the Nickelodeon television program, Rugrats?

664
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
Because what you just said is crazy.

665
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,560
Tommy, what are you wearing?

666
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,080
These are pants.

667
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
I wear pants now.

668
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,920
There's a little thing called artistic pride.

669
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,240
Yeah, you're wearing pants under your diaper?

670
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,280
That's crazy.

671
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,800
If you wear, if you're wearing shorts under your diaper

672
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,040
and a blue shirt, you're nothing.

673
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,560
You look like a crazy person.

674
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,280
Yeah, and you certainly don't have spirit.

675
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,080
By this person just having like a little bit of cloth

676
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,360
in between their juicy balls in the whole world, that's art.

677
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
That's Banksy, basically, is what I'm saying.

678
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah, that's how Banksy got started.

679
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,640
That's how he got his start.

680
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
That's how Banksy got his groove back.

681
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,880
Uh-huh, he's done it twice.

682
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
How about another question?

683
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,720
Over the holidays, a lot of people brought in baked goods

684
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,320
to work for everyone to enjoy while eating a cookie.

685
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,120
You don't need to brag, get braggy about it.

686
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,840
While eating a cookie made by one of my co-workers,

687
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,760
I felt something hard in my mouth.

688
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
After rooting around a bit,

689
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
I found an ordinary household staple

690
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,080
and not a staple like rice or grain, but an actual staple.

691
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,160
Long story short, I told the person who made the cookies

692
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
and now almost everyone in the office knows.

693
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,320
My conundrum was this, was I right to tell her?

694
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480
It's not like she could do anything about it after the fact

695
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
and she didn't throw away the rest of the cookies

696
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
or even remove them.

697
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,560
What the fuck?

698
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,920
That's from cookie conundrum.

699
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,400
You're good, they're not, that sucks.

700
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,560
Right, as you read the question, you get to the part

701
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,760
where it's like everyone in the office knows,

702
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,120
you're like, oh, how embarrassing.

703
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
And then you get to the part where the person who made them

704
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,800
said, uh-huh, yeah, what do you want me to do?

705
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,040
And didn't like move the cookies

706
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,400
or throw them away or anything.

707
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,960
And it's like, oh, she put that staple in there

708
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
because she hates you, Derek.

709
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,160
It's not, no, that's not addressed.

710
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,320
Like the person who made the cookies

711
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,360
may have taken a tin of them and tossed them in the trash.

712
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,480
No, he says that there, she didn't throw away

713
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,240
the rest of the cookies or even remove them.

714
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,400
Yeah, homie, it literally says that exact thing

715
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,520
you just said it didn't say.

716
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
Oh, okay, yeah, I see that now.

717
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,200
Who read the question?

718
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,320
I guess I just wasn't paying attention.

719
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,160
This person's the history's greatest monster.

720
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,840
This is the worst, are you kidding me?

721
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
If I go to Arby's right now and I bite into one

722
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,880
of their big, big buffalos, their big Beauforts,

723
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
and I chomp down on one of those

724
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
and I pull a fucking staple or any foreign object

725
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,280
out of my mouth, they legally have to get rid

726
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,200
of all of the sliced meat in the building.

727
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,040
Yeah, like your day is made though.

728
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,520
Like, cause after that, cause you got them on the hook.

729
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,560
Yeah, I got free beef for life,

730
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
but that doesn't apply here.

731
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
It's not gonna be like, Linda, you gotta cook me cookies

732
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,640
for the rest of my life.

733
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,960
This is a fucking wookie life bond.

734
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,280
I almost died because of your dumb staple cookie.

735
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,360
Now I need cookies hot and fresh,

736
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,280
two of them sitting on my desk every morn.

737
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,600
I completely disagree with telling about the staple.

738
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,480
Completely disagree.

739
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
Was that just because you would not do it?

740
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,640
No, it's, okay, think about it this way, okay?

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,560
One option is you don't say anything

742
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,840
and they did something, you know,

743
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,960
they're trying to do something nice.

744
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,880
Maybe they were, maybe they're a little bit slow

745
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,000
or in their twilight years, they're not as like observant

746
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
as they used to be and they accidentally left a staple

747
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,320
in there.

748
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,160
We all have staples on our clothes.

749
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
You find them from time to time.

750
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,240
Hold up, what?

751
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,000
We all have fine staples on our clothes.

752
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
You know, when you get bored and you stable your shirt,

753
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,760
you know.

754
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,280
When you accidentally put a staple.

755
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
You could have just thrown away that staple.

756
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,480
They would have felt good.

757
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
You would have felt morally vindicated

758
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
like you did a nice thing for somebody

759
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
and had their back for once

760
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,040
and that would have been great.

761
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,440
The alternate, because the alternate concept

762
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
is that you need to tell them

763
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,400
because they have dumped many, many staples into it.

764
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,960
And if they did that, they know they did

765
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,840
and they don't care.

766
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
They know the jig is up

767
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
once everybody starts tearing up these cookies.

768
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
The fact they almost killed you.

769
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,720
If it's late at night

770
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,680
and you're walking down the county road.

771
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
They did it.

772
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,560
Nope.

773
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,480
We're all almost killing each other constantly.

774
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Please, please.

775
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,040
You're walking down that county road at night

776
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,400
just trying to fucking clear your head

777
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,040
because you just got in a big fight with your sister

778
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
and you're just walking down that road.

779
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,680
Oh, damn it.

780
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,280
Linda, not again.

781
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,000
Not like this.

782
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
Then all of a sudden, who's that over the hill?

783
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,680
It's Barbara, your coworker

784
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,520
and she hits you with her car and drives off.

785
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,480
Oh, she got scared.

786
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,600
It could happen to anybody.

787
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,080
What's that?

788
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,800
You survived.

789
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,440
You're nursed back to health by a family of wolves

790
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
on vacation from wolf school.

791
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,240
And then what's that?

792
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,160
You come back into the office two days later

793
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,480
a little banged up, but still alive.

794
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,920
You wouldn't go to Barbara and be like,

795
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,320
hey, B, what the fuck?

796
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,720
You almost kill me with your car out on the county road.

797
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
You're suggesting you just let bygones be bygones

798
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
because we've all hit somebody on the county road

799
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,600
late at night.

800
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,960
That's nothing to do.

801
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,480
The two situations are completely different.

802
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
No, I think that tracks.

803
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
I think that's absolutely correct.

804
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,640
Thank you, Travis.

805
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
It's attempted murder is what it is.

806
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,640
Even if it's accidental, you still attempted it.

807
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,680
I think there's precedent that almost eating a stable

808
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,920
and getting hit by a car and driving off

809
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,240
are basically in the same wheelhouse.

810
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,280
Now, I'm not going to say that it's the same severity,

811
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
but they're definitely related.

812
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm going to say that.

813
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280
The defense rests, your honor.

814
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
There's another option here.

815
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
What if you went up to Barbara and you're like,

816
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,840
Barbara, I found a staple in the cookie.

817
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
And she went, that mischievous ghost.

818
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
And there was just a ghost dumping staples

819
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,480
into the cookies.

820
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Is it just staple?

821
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
That seems like a really specific form of haunting.

822
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,280
Does it dump dice in there occasionally?

823
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,160
What's it?

824
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,800
Well, he's more of a Harlequin figure.

825
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,680
He's just stirring up the pot and creating trouble,

826
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
wreaking havoc.

827
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,200
You're saying, but staple-based havoc.

828
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,680
Well, you use what you've got access to,

829
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,760
and Barbara's been stealing office supplies.

830
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
That makes sense, actually.

831
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
And he has thin, reedy arms,

832
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,160
so he can't lift a lot of things

833
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,040
that what would normally cause trouble.

834
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah, what's he going to do?

835
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,640
Put a printer in there?

836
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Come on.

837
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,160
Absolutely not.

838
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,080
Barbara stole a fucking printer?

839
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, Barbara's got sticky fingers.

840
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
Yeah, but fucking crime of the century.

841
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,280
That's incredible.

842
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
How does she even get out?

843
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,200
What if Barbara, where Barbara comes from,

844
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
that's a very lucky thing.

845
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,360
That's how I would play it if I was Barbara.

846
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,160
Oh, like finding the page?

847
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,560
Oh, like finding the baby and the king cake.

848
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
You found Ungunther's staple.

849
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,040
That's the one lucky staple,

850
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,360
is how it loosely translates for my people.

851
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,960
And you'll have good fortune all throughout the year.

852
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,680
And then they raised him up on his shoulders

853
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,560
and mired his broken teeth.

854
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,840
Good news, everybody.

855
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,520
Rick found the Ungunther's staple.

856
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,440
Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.

857
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
Oh shit, we got to take Rick to the hospital.

858
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,480
He's too lucky.

859
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,000
Luck is bleeding from his face.

860
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,040
Let's go to the money zone.

861
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Hell yeah.

862
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,760
Many problems that you experience in your day to day

863
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,440
start in your head.

864
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,200
It doesn't feel that way.

865
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
It feels sometimes like they start in your gut or your butt,

866
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,400
but it's not.

867
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,960
It's your head.

868
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,040
Fear, anger, stress, anxiety, depression.

869
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,640
All these leads to the dark side.

870
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,080
All these leads to the dark side.

871
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
How do you stay on the light side?

872
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,040
Headspace.

873
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,160
It's meditation made simple.

874
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,840
These are guided meditations you can listen to

875
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,280
whenever you want, wherever you want,

876
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,960
right on your phone, computer, or tablet.

877
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
And let me say, I've been doing meditation

878
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,160
for almost a decade now.

879
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Thanks, Tim Allen.

880
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,560
Thanks, Tim Allen.

881
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,160
And what I really, really like about Headspace

882
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,680
is it's very user friendly.

883
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,440
Even if you're the type of person who's like,

884
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
I don't know if I could sit still for that long.

885
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,320
I don't know if I could get into it.

886
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,400
It's so well guided, but not in an obtrusive way.

887
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,320
It's very easy to get into.

888
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,040
I'm a huge proponent of meditation, generally speaking,

889
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,600
but also Headspace specifically.

890
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
I was using Headspace before they reached out to us

891
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,040
about advertising on the show.

892
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,200
So I was really, really excited to have an excuse

893
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
to talk about them.

894
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
Meditation, in general, I think is something

895
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
that a lot of people could use in their lives.

896
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,680
And Headspace makes it really easy.

897
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,080
They have this starter program that you can download

898
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
on their Headspace app for free.

899
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
And it's a take 10 program.

900
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,880
It's 10 days of guided meditation.

901
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,560
If you could just go to headspace.com slash my brother

902
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
and you can get all the details there.

903
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,840
I guarantee this is, you know,

904
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
I don't say this with a lot of advertisers

905
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
or a lot of things in anything.

906
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
This could legitimately change your life.

907
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,440
If you've been hearing people talk about meditation,

908
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,640
this is a killer way to get started.

909
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,120
Now, Travis has authored a guest guided meditation program

910
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
as part of this starter bundle.

911
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,600
And it is Tim Allen themed.

912
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,280
I know you're wondering, is it Tim Allen themed?

913
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
Would you like to hear a clip of it now?

914
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,520
It goes, oh, do you wanna do it or?

915
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,320
Yeah, here's the clip.

916
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,820
Okay.

917
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,400
Calm yourself, breathe in.

918
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,680
Breathe in, yes, the breath is what it's all based on.

919
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,760
Feel the power of the breath.

920
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,040
That's it.

921
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
Yeah, that's better than my things.

922
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm glad you took that joke and ran with it.

923
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,880
That address again is headspace.com slash my brother.

924
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,120
Check out the free Headspace app

925
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,760
and try the take 10 program and let us know what you think

926
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
because I think you'll be really pleased.

927
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
All right, you're done meditating.

928
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,080
Let's get fucked up.

929
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,480
We're gonna tell you all about Club W.

930
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,200
Club W's got all that sweet wine juice you need

931
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
to get fucking completely turnt.

932
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
This probably isn't the tone that they wanted us to take

933
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,760
in this advertisement.

934
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
It's time to party.

935
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
It may have been the tone that they specifically asked us

936
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,360
not to take, it's hard to tell.

937
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,360
Regardless of what they want,

938
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm gonna tell you all about Club W.

939
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,720
Club W is a wine delivery service.

940
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,320
It's a wine subscription service.

941
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,680
They are leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

942
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,120
They work directly with vineyards,

943
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,240
cut out all the middlemen and save you money in the process.

944
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
You can get premium wines delivered to your door

945
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,720
at a third of what you'd pay at the store.

946
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
And that's absolutely accurate.

947
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
Like sometimes you see these shipping subscription services

948
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
and you think, oh, I can't afford that.

949
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm just gonna go get like that super cheap wine

950
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
at the gas station.

951
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
No, no, no, no, don't do that.

952
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,280
Club W has wine that's affordable and delicious

953
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,920
and will impress your friends.

954
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,680
And they figure out what you're gonna want

955
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,960
by doing a quick six question survey.

956
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
You can go to clubw.com, answer those questions.

957
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
They'll put together a palette for you

958
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
and they'll start sending you wines.

959
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,280
And right now Club W is offering the Bim Bam listeners

960
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
50% off your first order.

961
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,080
If you go to clubw.com slash my brother,

962
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,680
that's clubw.com slash my brother

963
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
and you'll get 50% off your first order.

964
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,960
Please drink responsibly.

965
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,840
Don't be a dingus.

966
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah, don't be a ding dong about it.

967
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,920
Drink responsibly.

968
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,120
Just get fucked up in your own home

969
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,720
when you're like watching Netflix or whatever.

970
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,200
Got another message here.

971
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,080
This one's for Eric and it's from Sarah.

972
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,200
Sarah says to Eric, hey big bro, merry candle nights.

973
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,240
We are still technically in the candle nights window.

974
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
I think today's the last day actually.

975
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
It has no beginning and no end.

976
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,360
Oh, that's right.

977
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,480
It is eternal.

978
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,840
It is always and never.

979
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,600
Hey big bro, merry candle nights.

980
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,360
As I write this, it's August.

981
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,480
So you just moved to Toronto and I miss you already.

982
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
I hope you are super merry out there in the distant future.

983
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
Presumably we are all having holiday merrymaking

984
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,960
with laser trees and hover tinsel.

985
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,080
I hope it's awesome.

986
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,680
Love, little sister.

987
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,400
I love that.

988
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
That's so sweet.

989
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,360
That makes me really happy that I'm a cockles.

990
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,880
And robo-futuristic

991
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
and I could have done without what you just said

992
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,160
if I'm being frank.

993
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,720
Cockles?

994
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,040
Yeah.

995
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,760
Cockles?

996
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah.

997
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,040
I don't know why.

998
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
There's nothing wrong with cockles.

999
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
Nothing wrong with cockles.

1000
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,320
There's like seven.

1001
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,680
Ain't nothing wrong with no cockles.

1002
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,000
Okay.

1003
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Nothing wrong.

1004
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Read this next thing.

1005
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,560
Cockles, cockles, cockles.

1006
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,800
Stop, stop, next thing, next message, next message.

1007
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
I got a message for Casey.

1008
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,040
It's from Sarah.

1009
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
Sarah, you're probably listening to this

1010
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
while you're working hard to take home

1011
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
that sweet, sweet bacon.

1012
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Know that you are truly a badass

1013
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
and that your badassery is exceeded

1014
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
only by your handsome face

1015
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,400
and your kind, huge heart.

1016
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,720
Okay.

1017
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Merry Christmas or whatever.

1018
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,560
Depending on when this message is read,

1019
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,200
I love you.

1020
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,800
The last line of this is,

1021
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
brothers, help me punch it up

1022
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,080
with the joke or something as far as I get.

1023
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,160
I think I get sort of the shape of the message

1024
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,320
they were trying to send to us there discreetly.

1025
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,880
Okay.

1026
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,360
All right.

1027
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,560
So punch it up with the joke.

1028
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,440
Like, where can we get a joke in that message?

1029
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,400
Is there a joke in there?

1030
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
We're not really good at making up jokes.

1031
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,600
Yeah.

1032
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,840
Not if like, not if we're told to

1033
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,520
because we're kind of fucking rebellious.

1034
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
I like to imagine that Casey works at like

1035
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
some sort of pig destruction,

1036
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,360
like pig annihilation facility

1037
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,280
where the meats are claimed

1038
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,160
and then processed into literal sweet, sweet bacon.

1039
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,760
Or maybe it's that antique reclaimed meat.

1040
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,880
Oh, I see.

1041
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
It just sort of takes the scrapple, the leavens.

1042
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Yeah, where it's like,

1043
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
oh, we found this scrapple in an old school

1044
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,600
that we tore down.

1045
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah, sure.

1046
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,520
And now we've cleaned it up.

1047
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
We've got some reclaimed bacon.

1048
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,840
Yeah.

1049
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,400
That's great.

1050
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
If you want to make a coffee table out of that

1051
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,040
or like a headboard.

1052
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,120
Yeah, or a meat or bacon.

1053
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,880
Sweet, sweet bacon.

1054
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,080
So it's bacon, but it's...

1055
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,280
I was going to make like a joke about something

1056
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,960
that would be silly to do with bacon,

1057
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,120
but everybody's done fucking everything

1058
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,640
silly with bacon.

1059
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,920
There's like nothing I could say here

1060
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,880
that wouldn't be like,

1061
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,320
you could turn it into shaving cream.

1062
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,280
And then there's like a guy

1063
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,480
with a handlebar mustache like,

1064
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
actually, we've been making bacon-based shaving cream

1065
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,960
out of our Brooklyn-based distillery.

1066
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
That's good stuff, yeah.

1067
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
All of this is joke-like.

1068
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,440
So I think we've fulfilled-

1069
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,640
Similar to a joke, right?

1070
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,040
Yes.

1071
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,560
We've fulfilled the charge.

1072
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,520
Tai is a pedantic person.

1073
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,600
I think when he pronounces these words,

1074
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,840
it's in a very show-off-y way.

1075
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,280
Jairo.

1076
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,160
Yiro.

1077
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Sacrebleu.

1078
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,240
Sacrebleu.

1079
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
Ayers Rock.

1080
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,840
Uluru.

1081
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
What you are witnessing is real.

1082
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,440
The participants are not actors.

1083
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,920
They are actual litigants with real cases.

1084
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,240
They call in via Skype

1085
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,400
to Judge John Hodgman's court,

1086
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
the real people's court.

1087
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,920
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

1088
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
Find it at MaximumFun.org

1089
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,160
or wherever you download podcasts.

1090
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,720
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1091
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,720
Yes, please.

1092
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,640
This Yahoo was sent in by a couple of people, actually.

1093
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,040
Matt Stout and Chloe Smith-Guitard.

1094
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
Chloe Smith-Guitard and Matt Stout.

1095
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
Matt, I'm sorry, I didn't say your name like four times.

1096
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
Thank you, both of you.

1097
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Joe who asks,

1098
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,480
is having an imaginary enemy

1099
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
worse than having an imaginary friend?

1100
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,720
Worse in what context?

1101
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
I mean, categorically, it's probably worse, right?

1102
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,200
Like you got this fucking specter

1103
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,320
that only you can see

1104
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
that's just trying to mess with your shit all day.

1105
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
But you know what, I get it.

1106
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,940
Okay.

1107
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
Let me explain why.

1108
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,080
There's a little cult classic called Red Dwarf, right?

1109
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,600
And the whole premise is that, spoiler,

1110
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,480
there's a dude who's like the last surviving guy

1111
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,240
on a space station or a spaceship.

1112
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,440
And the hologram that the computer brings back

1113
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,200
is not the people he liked the most,

1114
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,280
but his roommate that he never got along with

1115
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
and they constantly bicker

1116
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,200
because they constantly bicker.

1117
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,160
That's what kind of keeps it interesting.

1118
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,440
There's that odd couple shit.

1119
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,320
Yeah, so you get that enemy who's like a friend to you.

1120
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
Like the people in Justify.

1121
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,080
I've had an imaginary friend

1122
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,160
since I was four years old named Marcus.

1123
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,920
Big Marcus?

1124
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
I mean, he was big when I was a little kid

1125
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
because when I was a little kid, Marcus was 36 years old.

1126
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
But now I might kind of catching up to him a little bit.

1127
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,280
Now he's just Marcus.

1128
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
He's ageless.

1129
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
And now, yeah, we're similar sizes.

1130
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,560
So yeah, he's 36.

1131
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
One day I'm gonna be an old man

1132
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,320
and I'm gonna talk to Marcus

1133
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,600
and I'm gonna be jealous of his youth.

1134
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,360
Anyway, Marcus means a lot to me.

1135
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,760
But I can't help but think like,

1136
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,160
what if I had an imaginary enemy also named-

1137
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,040
Sparkus.

1138
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,280
Noelle.

1139
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,800
Sportacus.

1140
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

1141
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,640
What if it was The Rock?

1142
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,840
Or what if it was Triple H?

1143
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,640
We'll say Triple H.

1144
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,360
The Rock based humor is a little bit overused.

1145
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,280
A little bit, yeah.

1146
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
So I have an imaginary enemy, Goldust.

1147
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,840
And then I could just, it's great for two reasons.

1148
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,120
One, Goldust is like gonna fucking constantly be coming at me

1149
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,720
and that pressure I'm gonna feel,

1150
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
it's gonna like two blades sharpening against each other.

1151
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,040
And then when I'm attacked by real life Goldust

1152
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,560
or real life Triple H or any WWE roster member,

1153
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,680
I'll be able to fucking take him on

1154
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,800
because I'll know the moves.

1155
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,840
Secondly, I can make Marcus and Triple H

1156
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,920
just fight whenever I want and just watch it.

1157
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,240
But what if it was more of a psychological enemy

1158
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,440
than it was a physical enemy

1159
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,760
and you just had someone like next to you all day-

1160
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,480
Are you rating me?

1161
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,840
Are you really gonna wear that shirt?

1162
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,640
Same principle applies

1163
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,880
because then I'll learn some good real life teardowns.

1164
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
And then like if I fucking run into Sheamus

1165
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,800
and he cuts in line at like Best Buy or whatever,

1166
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,160
I can just like tear his shit apart

1167
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,000
because I've had practice doing it.

1168
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,200
Wait, is Sheamus real?

1169
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,920
Yeah, he's a real one.

1170
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,040
Are you sure?

1171
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
Yeah, he's got red hair, he's current champ.

1172
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,240
Or he was, I don't know, I haven't watched him in a while.

1173
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,280
Anyway, one of the great things about having Goldust

1174
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
coming at you 24 seven-

1175
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

1176
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,840
Is that whenever you get into one of those times

1177
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
where people are comparing like how rough

1178
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,960
they're having it currently

1179
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,200
or like what a bad weekend they've had.

1180
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,360
And like you say, well, you know, I couldn't get in the restaurant

1181
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,280
I wanted to and everybody forgot my birthday.

1182
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,600
And you can always sort of tack on at the end.

1183
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,720
And also I have Goldust coming at me.

1184
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,120
Yeah.

1185
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,160
24 seven.

1186
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,560
I mean, it can-

1187
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,720
Like it makes everything way more impressive.

1188
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,840
Anything you can accomplish.

1189
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,600
It can make things kind of uncomfortable every now-

1190
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,320
Oh, fuck.

1191
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,960
No, not now.

1192
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,200
Goldust!

1193
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,700
Come on!

1194
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:33,060
Come on!

1195
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,560
Hey.

1196
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,860
Everything all right?

1197
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,780
I was really scared for a second.

1198
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,100
I thought a spider jumped on you.

1199
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,260
No, I mean even worse.

1200
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,140
It was a man dressed up in like gold grease paint and stuff.

1201
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,140
I fucking got him though.

1202
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,980
I know his fucking ways now.

1203
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,460
Cause I'm way bigger than when I was seven.

1204
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,380
I used to just get fucking dunked on.

1205
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:53,860
But now I get-

1206
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,580
Yeah, that's right.

1207
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,300
Motherfucker.

1208
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,060
Wait, Goldust has been coming at you since you were seven?

1209
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,300
Yeah.

1210
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,180
Listen, I had to mature really, really quickly.

1211
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Goldust seems like a weird vicious predator.

1212
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,380
Yeah, it's a hard childhood, man.

1213
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,660
The type of like vicious predator that only a child could envision.

1214
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,980
I'm a little bit winded.

1215
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,060
Yeah, but here's the problem.

1216
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,940
You get so used to the daily almost like hourly momentary attacks.

1217
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,340
Yeah.

1218
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,980
That one day when it doesn't come, you'll miss it.

1219
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,820
Well, no, we have a schedule.

1220
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,900
It's my fault.

1221
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,060
It was 10 before the hour.

1222
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,420
But what I'm saying is what if one day he moves on, Griffin,

1223
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,780
and your imaginary friend is no longer there and he's not attacking you.

1224
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,460
I guess I'm just gonna have to fucking spar with Marcus at that point.

1225
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,700
Marcus is a lover, not a fighter.

1226
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,020
You're right.

1227
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,660
He loses every time I make him and Goldust fight each other.

1228
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,340
Sometimes Marcus like stands in for me if I'm, you know, sick or whatever.

1229
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Boy, I love watching those two rowdy boys fight, though.

1230
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,300
Oh, how come when you say weird shit, everyone's on board.

1231
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,100
But when I say weird shit, they're like, stop talking about mangoes, Travis.

1232
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,140
I don't.

1233
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,100
Well, mine was real.

1234
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,980
Mine was like a real thing that I deal with all the time.

1235
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,980
Yeah, Griffin's was a few fortunate truth.

1236
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,220
Yes.

1237
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,740
Can we circle back around to this next year?

1238
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,100
Like, what has happened?

1239
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,380
What are we doing?

1240
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,100
What do you mean?

1241
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,020
It's 2016.

1242
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,660
What is it?

1243
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,500
Like, we're about to end this episode and we still have an answer for that question.

1244
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,980
I mean, we did answer it 2016, building bridges.

1245
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,620
Are we 100% certain on that, though?

1246
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,460
I want something with a positive message.

1247
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,940
I was suggested while you were in the turlet, 20 quicksteen, stop putting it off.

1248
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,140
And because, you know, 20 quicksteen, you gotta be quick.

1249
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,860
Nah, it sucks.

1250
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,660
Too much pressure.

1251
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,100
It's like a pressure.

1252
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,780
It's a pressure thing I don't really like.

1253
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,620
I feel like 2016 is good, building bridges, because you only have to do it once.

1254
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,180
So you only have to work up the courage to do it once during the year.

1255
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,660
You build one bridge and then they build one bridge.

1256
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,140
Oh, so we'll make it 2016, building bridge.

1257
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,220
Yeah, it can't be plural.

1258
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,980
You have to build at least two bridges.

1259
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,700
Yeah, that's a good point.

1260
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,140
But you could build two half bridges and then they meet each other in the middle.

1261
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,500
I don't think there's such a thing as a half bridge.

1262
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,860
Yeah, it's just a dock.

1263
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:19,380
That was fucking funny.

1264
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,740
That was funny, Travis.

1265
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,540
Thank you.

1266
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,260
It's time to get hard.

1267
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,940
That's what happens when you're on dayquil.

1268
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,980
You gotta get hard.

1269
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,220
This is the year we go hard on people who own docks.

1270
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,940
Like, come on.

1271
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,420
Just finish it.

1272
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,140
Here's a hammer.

1273
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,100
Here's some wood.

1274
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,220
It's time to finish it.

1275
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,580
2016 building bridges is good because you can also, I mean, you've got that fucking,

1276
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,180
you've had that hole in your garage for two years.

1277
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,380
Fucking take care of it.

1278
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,580
It's time to take care of it.

1279
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,380
Put a bridge on it.

1280
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,900
Because let me tell you, Justin, to your earlier point about this being 2016,

1281
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,820
and this year's gonna suck, you're wrong.

1282
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,500
This is the year where we fucking batten down the hatches for 2017,

1283
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,860
where, oh my God, it's going to get real.

1284
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,940
It is time to doomsday prep the shit out of 2016.

1285
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,980
I don't agree with that.

1286
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,500
And I'd rather not think that way.

1287
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,980
Okay.

1288
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,220
But I think every year is gonna be better than the year before.

1289
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,980
Well, that's the way it's been for me so far.

1290
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,780
You were the one who pitched 2016.

1291
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,100
That was about setting expectations.

1292
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,300
Thank you, Griffin.

1293
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,500
Yes, it was about lowering expectations and enjoying the year more

1294
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,940
as a result of this sort of like stoic perception of the situation.

1295
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:32,180
But I think that 2016 building bridges, I'm glad we have another sub colon on a year.

1296
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,860
I think that's very important.

1297
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,660
Should we wrap up?

1298
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,420
I know you got a place to be.

1299
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,860
We all got places to be.

1300
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,540
I know it's kind of a short one.

1301
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,660
Yeah, it's been a short one.

1302
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,300
But we had like one hour to record today.

1303
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,340
We are barely here.

1304
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,500
What do we usually do here?

1305
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,820
Well, this is the part where, first off, I thank everybody for coming to Candle Nights.

1306
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,320
Thank you.

1307
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,540
Thank you to a big thank you.

1308
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,660
You know, I didn't mention it repeatedly.

1309
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:08,340
But thank you so much to the folks on the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group

1310
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:16,500
that helped with filling the empty stockings, the NBNBA Angels who helped fill the empty

1311
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,260
stockings, especially Valerie Harness and all the other volunteers who helped make that possible.

1312
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,620
We really like, I say we, I didn't do that much.

1313
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:34,340
But the folks in that group and they even some of the people in that group like Jessica

1314
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,940
brought a bag of clothes when she went to Candle Nights to drop off at one of the charities.

1315
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,380
When we talk to people, like when we're in town for the holidays, we talk to people like

1316
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,900
we've known our whole lives from Huntington.

1317
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,180
They talk about that shit.

1318
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,980
So thank you so much.

1319
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,660
Thank you to, gosh, everybody.

1320
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,260
We got a bunch of gifts from folks and they were so sweet and so amazing.

1321
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,100
And we'll read all those off in the next episode.

1322
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,940
We literally are out of time to do it, which I know sounds ungrateful and shitty.

1323
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:10,340
But thank you all so, so, so much for we like spent like an hour opening presents the day

1324
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,340
that we all open presents from everybody that had sent it to our PO box.

1325
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,340
It was super cool and we appreciate it so much.

1326
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,460
And we'll have time to be more grateful soon.

1327
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,340
I also want to say a quick congratulations to Dexter who beat me in the My Brother, My

1328
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,580
Brother and Me Fantasy Football League Championship.

1329
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,620
It was fucking close.

1330
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,820
It was a nail biter, man.

1331
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,540
Yeah, it was.

1332
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,060
He won by like one point.

1333
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,260
Congratulations, Dexter.

1334
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,540
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1335
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,940
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1336
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,260
We signed a couple copies of that during Candle Nights.

1337
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,820
A lot of people train those as gifts, which I like.

1338
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,860
It's a good gift.

1339
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,660
Good album.

1340
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,940
Go listen to the other Maximum Fun shows.

1341
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,900
Go to MaximumFun.org.

1342
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,380
They're all free.

1343
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,980
They're all super great and amazing.

1344
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,580
And let's wrap up.

1345
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,460
That's what I do for us.

1346
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,260
Thank you so much, Griffin.

1347
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,540
Do you have a final question for everybody?

1348
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,020
Final one.

1349
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,780
It was sent in by Rachel Siska.

1350
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,420
Thank you, Rachel.

1351
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:04,900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Prometheus who asks, why does the Full House and Family Matters

1352
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,260
theme sound the same?

1353
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,220
Are they the same?

1354
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,220
I'm Justin McElroy.

1355
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,020
I'm Travis McElroy.

1356
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1357
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,180
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1358
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,900
Kiss your dad.

1359
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:24,500
Square on the lips.

1360
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,460
MaximumFun.org.

1361
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,500
Comedy and culture.

1362
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,620
Artist owned.

1363
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,660
Listener supported.

1364
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,460
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a horde of precious

1365
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,820
golden rubies.

1366
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,060
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

1367
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,260
I'm a dragon man.

1368
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,140
I cast fire on him.

1369
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,020
It's very good.

1370
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,660
I address the red dragon and say, us, we're the host of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

1371
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,220
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1372
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,260
Very good synergy.

1373
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,140
Commit to the bit.

1374
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,740
I roll to charm new listeners.

1375
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,540
It is very effective against all odds.

1376
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,580
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

1377
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,540
We host the Adventure Zone.

1378
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,620
It's a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

1379
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,980
It's a comedy podcast.

1380
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,940
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take

1381
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,660
the time to learn them.

1382
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,380
Maybe listen to us.

1383
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,020
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

1384
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,740
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

1385
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:41,540
I think this promo is a critical hit.
