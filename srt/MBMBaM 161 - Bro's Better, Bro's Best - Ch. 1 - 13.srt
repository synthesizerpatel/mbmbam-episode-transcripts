Hilarious hour from our first 13 episodes now. I know what you're thinking weren't those episodes pretty bad

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,400
Some some jewelers. I read this on the internet like that rough gems better than the ones that have been cut down

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,720
You know why why cuz cuz then cuz then they can cut it down and really make it their own well

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,920
Speaking of questions this one comes from Yahoo

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,200
The question is what is the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series Greek?

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,960
Scrappy buns Jones

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,080
How many times a week should I shampoo my hair? I'm currently on a wash thrice

37
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Shampoo every third wash cycle. Okay, we're gonna get just real talk here

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,600
Yeah, you just entered into our wheelhouse

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,060
This is it listen this is a matter of some debate for men of dry hair

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,520
Let me open up let me open up by saying I didn't know like

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,760
this is one of those many many things that I as a

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,340
22 year old adult should should know and and incorporate in my life, but I shampoo my hair every time I get

43
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,000
That's why you've got that hair like you have I shouldn't be you're having an awakening guys. It's our first awakening I

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
I feel like when I don't you're listening to awakenings with Justin Travis

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,120
I think I feel like I'm getting dirty like if I don't do it

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
I feel dirty is the natural oils that your scalp produces makes your hair look look

47
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,800
Think of it from like a caveman era your body biologically wants your hair to look better. It's trying to make your hair look better

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:17,160
It's doing what it can to help you and you like the 3d a rotation a day rotation. I am down now sometimes

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,680
What's the problem? You got to get in there on that third day with a real hard scrub or your Scouts gonna go to shit?

50
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,240
When my hair gets longer, and I know I'm running my hands through it a lot and getting that real gross

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
I'll do it two or two day rotation sir

52
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah, we've interviewed use a lot of products one day you and you got to get away from that feeling

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,840
There's one unsolved mystery here

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,640
Okay, so you guys obviously know more about this thing than I do but if you don't shampoo your hair

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,080
Then how are you supposed to put shampoo in your hair and let the suds run down and then just use those suds as soap

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Great question

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,840
You're telling me that I shouldn't use soap is what I'm hearing except for every Wednesday and Saturday I

58
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,800
I think that this grooming section. I'm gonna has taken a weird turn where it's like more about

59
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,840
Just had a terrible good life. It's weird. It started out. It's about one thing. That's kind of depressing

60
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm as clean as a motherfucker, but I do it in suspect ways

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,440
Yeah

62
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,160
Another thing you can do is um

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Do you guys you guys remember when you were younger and you go like on a first date with somebody and you'd be in?

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
The movie theater and it would take you like the entire two hour

65
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,280
Movie to get up the courage to like hold their hand

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,280
And so the entire time like your hand is kind of slowly

67
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah, and it's all exciting and scary. What you can do is do that with the stranger sitting next to you

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,640
Right and have it like stretch it out for the entire like if you're flying east to west coast

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
It's like a unit six hour, right?

70
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:08,360
So just take six hours and very slowly just have this campaign of of just no finger by finger

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Just move you'll be so distracted

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
You'll be so distracted so scared and like maybe maybe

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,080
Maybe

74
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,320
You know, maybe that large drill sergeant type sitting in 17 be made us be your special somebody

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,320
Right. Yeah, and if not, like even if you get shot down you just your your fights done

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,440
Take a chance. You know, I was reading my cosmo like I do

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,400
It's what I do and I found some great advice for the ladies

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,820
Little something ladies might like from an article tall called 30 things to do with a naked man

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,900
Mm-hmm, and this suggestion is find his g-spot

80
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,280
The hint is a guy's prostate the walnut sized gland under his bladder is the

81
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,440
ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed an ultimate magic button to

82
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,320
Analyze it partway through oral sex or intercourse rest two fingers against the swath of skin between his testicles

83
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
And they stay the fuck away

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,080
You mean taint

85
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,600
You mean it's a do you mean his taint right? It's an efficiency of language issue at this point. You mean his taste using cosmo

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,280
Um, please don't tell anyone to do that cosmo

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,400
My walnut is a temple and I don't want it doesn't need any insurrectionists

88
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
Nuh-uh

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
What's your walnut? How's everybody's wallet?

90
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
Situation today. It's like I it's feeling good the wallet wallets

91
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,640
Fine, I just remember when I went to Bonnaroo and I didn't shower for five days and I got walnut itis

92
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Here's my question what actual situation would that be okay in my god, this is the whoa, whoa

93
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,000
What when I went to see a walnut all adjust about my walnut itis and he checked my walnut like still

94
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,920
Still questionable. Yeah, you know, it's weird about that story Griffin went five days without a shower still shampooed every day. Yeah

95
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,440
I had lots of aquafina which I could you know, hey women my shit up. I don't touch my walnut

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Stay away from the walnut. Don't listen to cosmo

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Take a chance. This one comes from Yahoo answers user Nikolai. He says or she says no, I think it might be he says

98
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,280
This is under the pregnancy and parenting baby names category

99
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,220
He says can I name my baby girl Justin after Justin Bieber?

100
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,380
Why don't you pick somebody more deserving?

101
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,180
Why don't you pick a more deserving Justin to name your child after someone who's gonna give that kid the sort of

102
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
Minute one publicity that a baby starting out in today's fast-paced Twitter based world needs

103
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
Maybe name your baby after like a Justin McElroy somebody who's gonna get the name out there

104
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:51,880
Gonna get that baby's get that baby promoted Justin McElroy Bieber Nikolai. I love it. What about what about Justin?

105
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,360

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll tell you one time Justin. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have said it was it was just a tea. It was just

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,360
It was just a boat

110
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,960
It was just a boat at an amusement park and there was there was a calliope in the background

111
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,800
And I was had a belly full of cotton candy. I didn't know what I was doing

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm sorry

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,480
There was there was no line and I just I saw it there in the in the reflection of the streetlamp

114
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
And I thought yes, yes

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,920
I'm a boat man, but man for life, and I left you I didn't go to see you show and

116
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm sorry Biebs. I'm sorry. Why don't you name? Why don't you name your kid Viking Fury?

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,900
That would be the best see now I want to use that

118
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Viking Fury

119
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Yeah, this is my son Viking Fury. What's his last name?

120
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,480

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,800
I don't know. I named him Viking Fury. It really stuck

123
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,280
It's red like a sunrise. Did he just kill that narwhal?

124
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah, he did. He's crazy

125
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,700
Stupid Viking Fury get over here. Somebody honey get the muzzle

126
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Viking Fury is trying to eat mutton

127
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,760
His stomach can't digest he's only six weeks old

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Oh mush up some mutton, sweetheart for Viking Fury

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Take a chance, but she seems to enjoy going to movies dinner and spending a lot of time with me

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,000
But I was too timid to make her mine

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,920
I got it

132
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,440
I got a piece of advice from a man some unsolicited advice if you want to if you want to go out with this girl

133
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
Stop saying creepy shit like make her mine

134
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Oh

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,880
So do you want to go see a movie or should I just make you into a skin suit

136
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,880
Mine possess you for me. I mean for life to own you to have you

137
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,280
I just want to own you and make you mine. I just want to own your body just your body. That's my property

138
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,880

139
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160

Twig in there some leaves don't even worry about it. Don't worry about it, but you're mine now

141
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,200
As far as the signs you're looking for

142
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
This one comes from Yahoo

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,040
answers and I think it's great because

144
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,080
You guys are your professionals at this but the question is who is the founder of acting? I?

145
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,560
Would the subtitle is I would really like to know who is the founder of actor

146
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,040
Any answers, I think it's Aristotle I think Aristotle pretty sure it's Jim Varney

147
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,160
He was Ernest and the dad from Beverly Hillbillies and that coil dog high versatility

148
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,360
I think so. He was the coil dog. Yeah, he was a coil. He's everybody. I didn't know that

149
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Cuz he's a fucking chameleon

150
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,920
It was a chameleon

151
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,120
Were there any answers to that one?

152
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,680
There was one from a guy named theater doc

153
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,440
did he say that what did he say something boring like a poet named Thespis and 534 BC became the first person to play a

154
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
part on stage

155
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Barney revolutionized

156
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Perfected it

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,400
It's like how the Chinese may have invented fireworks, but I guess the Chinese perfected fireworks. We perfected blowing our hands off

158
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,820
There you go, uh, this one also comes from form spring

159
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,020
Hey guys, just wondering what the word cute means

160
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,620
I hear women use the word in conversation all the time and I am more and more confused about its true meaning

161
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
given its multitude of uses

162
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
It means chubby

163
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Sorry

164
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,540
But you got a great personality on the great personality

165
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:30,300
Sorry, they just substitute cute with non-threatening and that's exactly what it means. He's so cute means

166
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,060
He's so non-threatening and by non-threatening it means you you don't you don't know what she means when you she says cute

167
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,820
That's yeah, I'm threatening for you. There's a definition of non-threatening

168
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,320
Hey, hey, um, I got a little piece of advice for you prom king next time you're around

169
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,500
Someone who says cute flip a table just

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:56,020
A table see if they keep calling you cute that was that adorable was that so so cute and then just make love to them

171
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,220
Right there

172
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,300
They will they will not fight

173
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,420
They'll say can we flip the table back over and if they do fights if they do fight just just make them yours

174
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,940
Adam has a problem. I'm rude to us from Gmail

175
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,540
He says my friend doesn't seem to fully grasp the point of the would you rather game?

176
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,300
He puts this question such as would you rather be able to leap over tall buildings or have the ability to hear babies crying anywhere?

177
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,740
Let me just take a tea right here. It's a big tea sack right here and say

178
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,300
Um, that's a terrible power anywhere a newborn is distressed

179
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:49,340
Days would be like just cause it like from from dusk till dawn wake up to slumber not ever sleep sound of millions of babies

180
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,540
Read it keep reading the question because I like the second one better

181
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,620
Or would you rather be on fire or not be on fire? I

182
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,100
Want to read this guy, how can I teach

183
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,060
Play or is he a lost cause?

184
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,580
Adam I think man. I think you got a jettison that went into the Sun. Yeah

185
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,860
Yes, maybe he's just not allowed to play that game anymore. Maybe not that game maybe another one

186
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,780
Maybe he's really good at checkers be able to breathe

187
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,740
underwater or have Lyme disease

188
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,260
Would you rather

189
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Find a crisp clean

190
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,120
$100 bill or watch an elderly loved one. We push on a flight of stairs

191
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
It

192
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,920
Is up to you the choice my friend is yours one for the ages a puzzler for ages

193
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Would you rather have?

194
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,880
Okay a credit card credit card that you never had to pay back. Okay sounds good so far

195
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Or no teeth

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,840
Well, okay, I have both they're just just the one one or the other by the other

197
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
I

198
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,960
Guess I could get those those metal teeth like the guy from James Bond. There you go. I

199
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Can't I can't decide?

200
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,760
Everyone's favorite sound and the English language is the sound of their own name as a stone fact learn their name

201
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Use it a lot

202
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,040
They're gonna warm up to you pretty quickly and then find out something they're interested in and and ask them about it

203
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,680
Okay, and if you if you don't know what they're interested in use the environment that you're in if you are at a party at

204
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,760
a show at a concert

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,200
Reference what is going on around you ask if they're having a good time

206
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,280
Jeffrey how did you get to this concert Jeffrey?

How do you enjoy being the butler for the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Jeffrey Jeff Jeffrey Matthews band?

209
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,800
Yes, what did I do Jeffrey? I just got in Jeffrey Jeffrey. I didn't mean to say that Jeffrey

210
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
And then your best friends

211
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,600
Just like that say their name a lot and then at the first time you meet them say hey

212
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,380
Nice to meet you Jeffrey you want to go to a wine tasting with me Jeffrey?

They roll the double else

217
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,480
But as far as the timetable goes don't rush yourself because you don't want to do it when you're not ready and you're not prepared

218
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,240
You don't have the money, but you know, there's no reason to wait

219
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,720
You're not nobody do anything take the leap. Hey, did you ask Jeff? Did you ask Jeffrey if you needed a roommate?

220
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,880
Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey wish to move in together Jeffrey. We've just met Jeffrey, but let's just free

Jeffrey the black clouds are rolling in Jeffrey Jeffrey. Let us buy a puppy together Jeffrey Jeffrey. We'll even have Jeffrey Jeffrey

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,600
Let's go shopping at the local market Jeffrey to draw Jeffrey

228
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:51,040
My seven-year-old and I spend a lot of time in the car listening to music while commuting across town to horse her school or mother's house

229
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,520
I'd like to expose her to more artists and songs that I consider insightful and enjoyable, but they use more profanity

230
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,540
At what point is it? Okay to say fuck it and listen and let your kid listen to whatever they want

231
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,480
Now fuck it. I think it's okay to say fuck it after you count to three

232
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Justin could could you perhaps give me?

233
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,920
One two three and fuck it. It's like that just like that

234
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,560
You know what Tommy I think the bigger question is when did you forget what fuck it means?

235
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Like at what like do you do realize that fuck?

236
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,720
It's not like I thought this over and now my response to the situation. My decision is fuck it

237
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,520
Fuck it means like fuck it

238
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,080
I take all the variables into account the only decision I could come to you is fuck it. Fuck it

239
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,680
That's my decision. I checked the bubble box that says fuck it. Thanks to it after weighing all my options

240
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Fuck it

241
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720

247
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,280
Mega Jessup. Hey, who's that? Who's currently destroying our town? It is mega Jessup

248
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,680
To be fair just how he starts out and then he becomes mega Jessup

249
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Don't make him angry

250
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,840
So I'm accompanying my wife to visit her parents in the coming weeks and while the visit is usually rather painless

251
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,600
The bed we are relegated to is very noisy

252
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,240
Being relative newlyweds. We still engage in the relations

253
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,480
If you know what I mean and was wondering what the etiquette on fooling around in this awkward situation might be Jeff

254
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
You ready for the pleasure

255
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:10,320
Mima mima is literally this this wall is stucco. This wall is completely stucco it anything we do

256
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Listen I want to show you

257
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,600
that our relationship is still as fiery as

258
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,760
Fiery as it was when we started no, no Jeff. No

259
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Jeff no, no, no

260
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
No, I'm married Jeff. No

261
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Gross Jeff gross

262
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,200
Jeff is a grown-ass man with grown-ass urges

263
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,160
Just got to get himself sassified and Jeff noisy bed

264
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,880
Adjacent me ma or no Jeff needs to get Jeff needs to get his Jeff off

265
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,560
Jeff if you were if your urge

266
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,500
To get your Jeff off is not so strong

267
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,620
But you have to rent that you can't rent a room at the super 8 away from your meemaw

268
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,580
Then your urge to bed down. It's not so strong that it cannot be resisted

269
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm saying learn how to bone down on the quiet by an inflatable mattress and lay that out because that completely

270
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Obviates the whole squeaky bed issue

271
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:21,480
Maybe carry that around your bag and then lay that down and it makes sweet silent love upon it

272
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,400
Maybe you should maybe you should approach this uh, this problem head-on, right? Here's my plan

273
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,320
Go to your in-laws the day day one

274
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,240
Say listen, I appreciate you having us the bed

275
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,100
You've supplied us with is quite loud and we're afraid that our noise making will be a ruckus

276
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
so

277
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:50,360
What bed might be quieter that you could accommodate this with and also where can I put my oversized duffel bag with the words?

278
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
lube bags

279
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
Said I put that in did look like some spare room in me ma's abode. Can I put it me?

280
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
Was room will she be offended? I will need to access it a regular

281
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,840
Meemaw don't be coy, you know exactly what this oil is used for you old whore you old racist whore

282
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880

Moving on that's the username here via gmail

285
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,900
It's a great question. I think it's one might be divisive has a potential to be divisive peeing in the shower

286
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,280
Yeigh or nay honesty time don't say anything. I think we all just need to

way our bathrooms set up I can just open the curtain and the toilets right there

292
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,800

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,380
sale that explains why our magazines are always soiled you're office you know

shower I'm saying fucking aim for the drain and be you're lying that's a good

299
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,100
motivational poster you're lying to yourselves because the two of you are

300
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,460
living in sin and you are embarrassed to admit to each other that you might have

301
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,420
stepped in the one another's urine from time to time that's all I'm saying you're

302
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,380
lying I want to do I want to see a poster where a dad puts his hand on his

303
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,420
son's shoulder and just says son aim for the drain we're not stepping in each

304
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,900
we don't take showers together that's not our style we're not down with magic

305
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,500

307
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,820
practically a toilet you stand up in to get clean the shower is a toilet you

308
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,320
stand up in to get clean recently the buzz about not having elections in

309
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,420
2012 has gained a lot of momentum it seems to stem from several of Obama's

310
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,540
initiatives and other legislation being introduced that gives Obama some

311
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,380
frightening powers for example cyber legislation gives Obama sole power to

312
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,780
shut down the internet presidential term limits repeal of the 22nd amendment and

313
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,900
the controversial 16,000 armed IRS agents on radio and TV I have heard

314
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,020
several comments about the possibility that we will not have presidential

315
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,020
elections in 2012 when guests to the various show mentioned the elections

316
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,860
and possible turnovers in 2012 several hosts have remarked if we have

317
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,380
elections in 2012 now that Obama is a cyber God he can pretty much take that

318
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:23,060
out with a wave of his cyber hand if if President Obama President Barack Hussein

319
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,220
Obama shuts down the internet can we keep doing our show oh we can shout yeah

320
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,420
we'll just have to yell really loud so we'll do like live stage versions

321
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,860
yeah exclusively Obama has the power to single-handedly shut down the internet

322
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,780
he has a switch on the underside of the of the desk you can't stand up too quick

yeah shut it down Yahoo answers a font of constant comedy

326
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:04,540
it's gone now this question itself whoa so not only can he shut down the internet

327
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,020
he erases the internet from time he also has that cyber power you mean sole

328
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:19,860
power he has that sole power from the cyber legislation held in TechnoCon

329
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,440
there was a cyber bill in Techno Congress that gave him the power to go

330
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,340
back in time and stop events from happening Android of the house can you

331
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,220

greatest movie ever time-travel president yeah Yahoo answers user rock

334
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:54,620
just as that spelled our a queue by the way whoa I'm figuring that's how he

335
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,460
prefers it to be pronounced hey need a film not anything like the

336
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:07,820
lake house or that sort to watch anything for a 15 year old girl but not

337
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:16,540
all right not in the wheelhouse of the lake house the only parameters the one

338
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:24,940
criteria is choice okay might I suggest the lake house no wait fuck you choked

339
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,100
you choked back or what you choked not the lake house anything but the lake

340
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:36,940
house hmm what maybe something that maybe walk in the clouds maybe that's

341
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,580
not my good I'm thinking of I'm trying to think of other Keanu Reeves time

342
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,780
travel based rom-coms Oh Bill and Ted's excellent love affair

343
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:56,500
Bill is head's most tender engagement travel through time kiss and George

344
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:05,100
Carlin this question is troubling to me because of the the addendum I'm

345
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,140
desperate for something different to watch this is a 15 year old girl who her

346
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,140
entire life the only film she's ever watched is the lake house I'm ready for

347
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,060
something I would say the Jurassic Park films that would probably be a good

348
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,020
place to start have you tried Titanic well you've never seen any movies I

349
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,660
don't know where to start with you have you tried anything else it's not not

350
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,900
that she hasn't seen any movies she done seen the lake house don't even try to

351
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,300
quote lake house to her she knows all the lines all the classic classic lines

352
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:47,580
like how am I I've got a time-traveling mailbox and whoa my wife and I are

353
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,340
expecting first child in a month she wants some songs that would be good to

354
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,780
listen to in the delivery room can you give me some great tracks for this

355
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,940
special occasion that's from Thomas via Gmail no I think we could come up with

356
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,780
something I actually I read this question earlier and I came up with a

357
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:11,060
really great solution and I think for the the longer portion the more drawn-out

358
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,220
portion like from when she actually gets posted up in the room okay starts

359
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,020
squishing out the baby you put on something soothing right something

360
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,180
mellow something like iron and wines double-sided LP around the well just

361
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:32,380
something to bring the mood down to see that and then and then right when she

362
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,820
starts crowning thunderstruck by a CDC wow I don't mean you do better than

363
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,500
thunderstruck like if you guys want to try and come at me with something else

364
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,300
but thunderstruck would be come out with arms wide open by Creed fuck you with

365
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,340
that it's about bringing a baby in the world it's perfect get out of the show

414
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,300
didn't do any of that stuff when you're recording these because we were just

470
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,980
long distance relationship is way harder than you think it would be 100 miles

471

to I love the Viking the Viking fury I want to make that really beautiful boat

474
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,220
last night I went to my friend's 21st birthday party when suddenly his

475
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,180
girlfriend who was very drunk told me she had feelings for me I don't feel the

476
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,300
same about her so my question is how do I or even do I tell my friend okay hold

477
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,300
on you're at you're at your friend's birthday party his lady tells you she

478
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,700

479
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,260
you got buddy you got a little something I like to call a non problem you do not

480
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,200
have an issue that you need to address here's the important little segment

481
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,420
there she was very drunk doesn't matter I say things it's surfaced guys say

482
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,540
things you wouldn't believe it's astonishing how many questions we get

483
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:01,220
where my answer is just pack up and move away again because that's literally the

484
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,900
only the only solution I have for this maybe that's why I've been such a

485
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,020
globetrotter these past few years I just keep messing up social situations in my

486
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,900
mind this is unfixable and you have to get all the global reset I'm a 17 year

487
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,020
old New Zealander and over here any showing of anger to anyone will often

488
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,900
result in a physical fight I have the problem that I seem to either bottle it

489
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,260
up I've been meditating late and it seems to help a little in thinking about

490
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,700
things are completely far off the handle and hurt people badly I was wondering if

491
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:44,860
you guys could help Sean you're you're uh you're talking to three guys who are

492
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,060
raised Baptist if you're looking for guys here tell you to not bottle it up

493
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,460
you've come to the wrong um cork it to your bottle breaks and then you get a

494
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:03,500
bigger bottle here's one yahoo answer also sent to to me by action Alan thank

496
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:18,460
practical kicks oh just you wait I want a list of kicks all must be practical

497
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:24,500
and where they would land so far the obvious front kick to groin mid-area

498
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:32,180
head sidekick to groin mid-area I personally don't like this one because

499
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:41,020
it's hard to see round kick to lower leg back of knee all suggestions are welcome

500
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:48,580
I'm gonna kick the spirit yeah how about below to your sub self-conscious hey

listen why do you need this list Sean what are you doing guys can we get he's

502
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,620
got the front he's got the side he's got the round okay considered a donkey kick

503
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,820
a back kick as it's referred to it back some circles where an assailant comes

504
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:09,580
behind you you can usually kick the front of their knee or groin area and

505
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,300
that will that will completely take them out of the fight altogether have you

506
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,060
tried to spin kick spin kicks really good how about if the coolest kick you

507
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,520
can do how about a kick in which the point of your boot goes into their

508
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:31,980
butthole a well-aimed butthole kick have you tried perhaps like a reuse style

509
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,900
bicycle kick where you fly through the air for ten seconds and squeal like a

510
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,860
pig about an awesome kid where you literally take their head off in one

511
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:46,220
clean yeah yeah awesome the mental kick where you don't actually kick but they

512
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,220
think that you do and then about three days their stocks crash what about the

513
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,100
kick where you take your foot off and make the guy smell your foot like in a

514
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:02,740
funny movie that's pretty funny yeah have you tried it a taint kick what a

515
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,700
taint kick where you kick them square in the tank and it lifts them off of the

516
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,220
ground and into the air by about three feet could I know it's really hard to do

517
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,420
could I suggest a kick kick which is where you kick their kick and disrupt

518
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,620
their kick with you gotta be careful though because if you don't time it

519
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,420
right they'll kick your kick and then you're fucked

520
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,860
it's a kick kick kick let's triple kick the KKK no have you tried to punch kick

521
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:41,980
which is where you take your shoe off that's a that's a pretty comprehensive

522
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:49,580
list I feel yeah I think that's all the kids all the kicks I know about yes what

523
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,100
about the junior kick where you kick their kid yeah that's sometimes more

524
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:01,700
painful in the long run I mean what you need you need a starter that you can

525
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,820
always bring with you a baby is good yeah a dog you can get a dog is good or

526
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,540

586
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,740
Christians if we did discover aliens should we share the gospel with them

587
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:47,620
does Jesus love aliens too deep I would think that it takes so much energy to

588
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:53,580
love people that like he's got to have an outlet and the outlet is probably

589
00:51:53,580 --> 00:52:00,100
hating people from other I love everyone on earth but everywhere else fuck them

590
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,700

00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:10,980
when Will Smith he fired the new but it didn't go off until a miracle happened

592
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,460

Randy Quaid Randy Quaid wasn't in that film yeah it was you're too young to

595
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,100
remember because you just remember him as a hero because you're a child you've

596
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:35,340
replaced him in your mind's eye with Jesus now is Randy he does hate he does

597
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,060
hate people from other planets but at the millennial Jesus convention he

598
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,980
always covers it up like he doesn't tell Mars Jesus that he hates Martian so it's

599
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:50,340
a franchise right because I've always assumed the Jesus franchise Jupiter Jesus

are trying not to laugh I wish they could see you're really hard but you're

605
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:51,220
smirking I really don't want to be labeled as some kind of pervert if you

606
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,220
guys have an easier way to tell the approximate age of a girl without

607
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,260
simply walking out to her like a creeper and just flat-out asking you

608
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:03,180
much appreciate have you considered have you considered cutting her in half and

609
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:12,900
counting her rings or is that all you can consider you sicko what is your life

610
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,020
straight I'm I assume your worry is that you don't have sex in the underage girl

611
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:24,220
cool what is going on with your life strategy that you think there's a fairly

612
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:29,260
good chance you could end up boning down on a girl before you figure out what her

613
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,900
like life situation is like before you figure out how old she is and stuff like

614
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,820
what kind of chicken and egg situation do you have where that's your that's

615
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:44,720

622
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,140

623
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,420

625
00:55:33,540 --> 00:56:02,380
here's what I would do I would wait until you know she's gonna walk in her

626
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,860
room then you get a bucket you fill the bucket with water and then you put the

627
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:10,240
water water bucket half on the door jam and half on the door and then when she

628
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,860
opens the door it it all tumbles on to her she'll be she'll get she'll get

629
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,140
moist from the water in the bucket and okay what you're saying this works both

630
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,500
ways if she broke up with you if she pulled a prank on you then you pointed

631
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:30,540
her after the water bucket falls on her and you laugh if she dumped you then you

632
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:36,620
pointed her and say well no one will have you now and the best you're gonna do

633
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,700
wedding film it and put it on YouTube and said you've just made a terrible

634
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,060
fool of yourself and then walk away that's going viral I'll see you this

635
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,980
