1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Griffin, I want to start the show, but I have to say, your eyes are looking so dope.

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
It's, um, they're, they're, they really pop nowadays, don't they?

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,080
Yeah, it's, it's like, uh, your eyes have a groove. Like, if I may say that

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
my eyes are honorary members of the dog pound.

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
Tell do tell how did you achieve this? Look, it must have been expensive.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,480
I went to the glasses store and the elderly lady who was making me try on every goddamn pair of

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,200
glasses in the store. Um, she was the proprietor, not just some old lady that was in the store. Uh,

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,560
she was like, you know, your eyes kind of looked like the eyes of the basis from journey. And I

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,160
said, Oh, that's funny. Um, do you mean Randy Jackson? And she says, yes, I have just the

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,000
glasses for you. They're Randy Jackson's glasses. Oh my, how did you afford that?

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,840
They were extremely expensive. Um, but I, you know, I decided I'm 24 now going on 25.

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
It's time that I have good things in my life.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:03,280
You've earned it. Um, so I, I, uh, yeah, I joined the dog pound and, um, now I make, uh,

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,120
sort of inane criticisms of things that don't make any sense nor mean anything.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,000
You may, you make references to working with Michael Jackson that are apropos of nothing.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,880
Yeah. And, and just totally untrue, patently untrue, uh, speaking of patently untrue,

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,640
this is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm your middle, his brother, Travis McElroy.

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,160
I'm your youngest Randy Jackson is brother. Can we, can we start the Halloween talk now?

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Halloween is today. And

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
Hello boys and ghouls.

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,800
Nope. Daddy, no, like, but I've been working on that like all week. No last night. I feel

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,400
like last night was the official Halloween party night. Um, did you guys partake?

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
It's, it's not the official party night for theaters.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, that's right.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
Sunday is the new Saturday.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
Sunday's the new Saturday for theaters. Uh, I was thinking we could maybe go around and

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,520
everybody could say what they, uh, uh, what they dressed up as. I, uh, was, uh, deposed

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,120
head of the, uh, federal reserve, Ben Bernanke.

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Well, that's a good one.

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,520
Yeah. I thought so.

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,600
Um, I was a, I was a drunk baby.

38
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,880
It's a good look.

39
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,800
It was a good look. It did. I didn't start out. I didn't, it's complicated,

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,520
but I didn't start out that I sort of became that I was, uh, sleep. Yeah.

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Travis is Morpheus.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
It's pretty bad-ass.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,280
That's what he said.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah. I, everybody kept asking me, Justin, I think Ben Bernanke is the current, uh, current head.

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't think you know who this person is.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,800
And then I said,

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
I think you just like his last name.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,120
I said, I, but I addressed as him deposed. I said, Hey, it's Halloween. Live in the fantasy.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,520
I feel like if there was a governmental figure somewhere in the world with the last name Skittle

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,400
Fingers, then you would have said that you were that person.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
Mm-hmm.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,560
Hey, also something else I was thinking about last night at while dressing as deposed chief

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
of the federal reserve, Ben Bernanke from an alternate future where he has been removed from

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,920
his position. Why is nobody saying drama, drama, save it for Obama? Why is that not caught on?

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
Um, that's, see, that's exactly why I'm glad we have this platform.

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
Yeah. Hey, everybody, if you could just drop that in a combo.

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
I know I could tell from the roaring reaction it got on the show that it's a pretty good line.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
So wait, hold on real quick. So you're not saying chant this at like a rally or you're saying like,

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,200
if you're having a conversation with a friend and find a place to work it in drama, drama,

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
save it for Obama. Don't you think?

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,120
I invented a kind of a fun Halloween party game this morning.

62
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
And I think it only works on Halloween when you're a grownup and you got drunk

63
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,200
the night before at a Halloween party where everybody's wearing costumes.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,280
And it's, um, it's called, uh, I blanked on or at blank.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
You fill in the blanks with a, with a verb and a thing like,

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,680
like last night I threw up on a dinosaur.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
Last night, I farted on Skrillex.

68
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,480
Last night, I yelled at the black eyed peas.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's get to the advice. My trusty vehicular sidekick has finally started to kick the bucket.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Soon I'll be, I'll have to be doling out some serious dough to purchase a new new to me vehicle.

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
That's the only smart move by the way. But of course I want to get a great deal.

72
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
It's been a long time since I've had to do this and I feel a bit crusty.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Rusty. What are rusty? What are your best haggling tips?

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,520
I feel crusty.

75
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I feel crusty. See a doctor.

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
Um, that's from finagling Phil.

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,360
I have bought a car recently. Um, and it is, it is an intimidating world out there guys.

78
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,320
What'd you, what'd you go with?

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
What?

80
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
What'd you go with?

81
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Hearse.

82
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,360
Payton, I got tricked. He said it was just a long car, but it was a hearse.

83
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,920
What are you looking for?

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
Is this an Oldsmobile long car?

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Is this an Oldsmobile long car? Why is there a picture of a ghost with a no sign over him?

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,640
I'd buy Ecto-1.

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,360
So you're looking for a sedan or a hatchback or a truck or a, we got this hearse.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
Got a hearse. Ecto-1.

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,320
What's the, what's the brand? Oh, it's hearse.

90
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Hearse brand. Nobody knows who makes hearses.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
I wish I'd been there at that design meeting. Like, Phil, this is a really cool car.

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't know who you're putting in the back though. It's like, you know,

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
you can just have somebody back there and just chill.

94
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
It's like a portable nap room.

95
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
It's like a portable nap room that I made.

96
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
A portable forever nap room.

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,760
I would love to have been in that meeting. Cause I would have said,

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm going to throw something out. Flame decals. That would be cool.

99
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Cause they're taking them to hell.

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, I think that your, your best bet is to, and, and this is, this is tough, but

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
go to as many different places as you can.

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Look at as many different cars as you can, because the, the only time that you're getting

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,400
into trouble with this sort of thing is, is if you aren't willing to walk away.

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,600
And if you get your heart set on a car and you think like, this is the one for me,

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,640
then it's going to be harder for you to negotiate.

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,200
Cause you'll be worried about losing your car.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,440
You'll be worried about losing it or worried about looking like a jerk or whatever.

108
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
And remember the worst they can say is no.

109
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,720
I bought those Randy Jackson glasses yesterday.

110
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
It was the very first store I walked into.

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
And it was almost the very first pair of glasses I saw.

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,880
I bought them for $300.

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,640
I don't think I know how comparison shopping works.

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm saying, I don't think you're buying a car in this situation.

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,480
You're buying the man.

116
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,640
And by the man, I mean the salesman that you have to find somebody who makes you feel

117
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
like you're not getting fucked.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
Like he's not trying to fuck you.

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
But Griffin, don't you understand?

120
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
That is how they work.

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
That's the exact vibe that these guys work to cultivate.

122
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
Like they are trying to give you that vibe.

123
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
But now let me take that a step further.

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
They go and actually buy the man and start asking him questions like,

125
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,040
what's your miles per gallon?

126
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,280
Yeah.

127
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
Do you have automatic windows?

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
Do you take diesel?

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,960
What are your safety features?

130
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Do you know Kung Fu?

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Can you protect me?

132
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,240
I bought mine from a shady fat guy because I knew where he was coming from.

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080
I was like, hey, I get your style.

134
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
You're not trying to pull one over on me.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
You're a shady fat gentleman.

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
You're both blatantly sketchy and obviously like Cheetos.

137
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,360
You love food.

138
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
You love food.

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
When I got there, this is not a joke.

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
When I got there, the hood of the car was open and all the tires were off of it.

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
And there was a guy in a hat trying to charge the battery.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll take it.

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
There's somebody like that.

144
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
They're not trying to pull a fat.

145
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,400
They're like, listen, you get what you get, you know?

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah.

147
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,680
It is what it is.

148
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Is there some kind of event that you could stage that would strengthen your bargaining position?

149
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Like a hostage crisis?

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,040
Well, I'm saying like a mugging or like a hostage crisis.

151
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
You want to become the community darling.

152
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,760
Yeah.

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
No one would rip off Little Rick, a mugging victim.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
Little Rick.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Little Rick might hurt you.

156
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,920
As you're walking across the street to the lot, you like save a kid from getting hit by a car.

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,480
Yeah.

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,880
Okay.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,360
Yeah.

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,200
And you become like the light on the hill for your whole city.

161
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah.

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
Who's going to rip that guy off?

163
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
An asshole.

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
That's how he's going to rip Little Rick off.

165
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
He's the light that got us through the depression.

166
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
Is there a way that we can get this guy a car for free?

167
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,960
Yeah, that's easy.

168
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,320
Kickstarter.

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,520
Just go on Kickstarter.com and say, hey, help me buy a car.

170
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,280
And then the payoff is I'll give you rides whenever you want for your rides.

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,080
That's great.

172
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,600
If you donate a hundred bucks, I will take you to the airport.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Don't you worry about it.

174
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
It's like a limited number of rides.

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,040
Like for a hundred dollars at some point in your life, you're going to need a ride.

176
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
And maybe that person is not going to drive there,

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
but they'll call someone they know or maybe get you a taxi.

178
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah.

179
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Are you planning on flying into Boise, Idaho anytime soon?

180
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,080
If so, I will pick you up.

181
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,480
I will pick you up.

182
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
No questions asked.

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
I have a Toyota Corolla now, or I will.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,720
Give me a hundo.

185
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,520
With your help, we can all own this car, by which I mean me.

186
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,120
I like that.

187
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Or maybe you're feeling really generous.

188
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll name it after you.

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
Donate 500 or more.

190
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
I will name the car after you.

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
There are five of this gift.

192
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,880
So the car will have five names.

193
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
My car is like the arcade fire.

194
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
So many different names in there.

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,280
Here's my bargaining.

196
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,560
Go early.

197
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,680
Go crazy.

198
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
Just tell them, hey, I'm not going to pay you more than $17 for this car.

199
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
And let them know that you're not coherent.

200
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Oh, what if you just said, I will pay nothing for this car?

201
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Instead of low balling, just no balling.

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,840
No ball them.

203
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
It's like, nope.

204
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,080
But I still want it.

205
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,400
Last time I tried to negotiate with a car guy, my wife accused me of no balling.

206
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,400
I bought a car from a credit union.

207
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,840
And I've never had to haggle with a man for something that's going to be as ubiquitous

208
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,040
in my life as an automobile.

209
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
Is it something that still really happens?

210
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I feel like in this age of Yelp-

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,920
You know what?

212
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,640
I bought my car rebuilt, Griffin, the zombie car.

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, I remember.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
We knocked $1,000 off of it.

215
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,840
And it was already only like $5,000.

216
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,000
That must make you feel great, but I feel like that's the exception to the rule.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,680
In this age of Skype and Yelp and eBay,

218
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,920
why can't I just internet a car and not have to worry about-

219
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,760
I can comparison shop on the internet.

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,440
I was watching TV the other day, and Christian Slater told me about one of those places.

221
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,720
But see, I feel like I'm being fucked by internet in that occasion, which is way more raw

222
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
than being fucked by a man.

223
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,120
Right.

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Uh-huh.

225
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
Well, Phil, here's my advice, because this is what I would do.

226
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
Take my dad with you.

227
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,860
Okay.

228
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,940
Take Clint McElroy with you, and have him negotiate for you.

229
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,140
Have him be your proxy.

230
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,700
Can we rent our dad out for situations where you need a dad?

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,060
And let me be clear, you need a dad when you're car shopping.

232
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,560
Uh-huh.

233
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,500
Rental dad.

234
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,340
Gots to have a dad in your pocket.

235
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,300
Hold on, what about my daddy?

236
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,060
That's the name of the business, dad in your pocket.

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,780
That's also another good-

238
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,380
If you ask your friends and family if they know somebody who sells cars,

239
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,140
who presumably won't flip you over and just fuck you dry.

240
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Just right there on the hood of the car!

241
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Just like you're in a Poison music video.

242
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,940
This is uncomfortable for me.

243
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,420
You know a good bargaining technique if you're uncomfortable with the whole idea, like myself,

244
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,620
tell them that your financier, whoever they may be, the bank or the whatever,

245
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,780
won't give you as much as they're asking.

246
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,580
That's a good one.

247
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,540
Because then you decide how much you want to pay for it.

248
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,580
And say, listen, the most they're willing to give me is this.

249
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,180
Can we work this out?

250
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,260
Can we do this, Price?

251
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,140
I like that.

252
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,860
What about just giving them the old silent treatment?

253
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,180
Hey, uh, uh, Dave, there's been a guy standing out in the lot,

254
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,820
staring at that Subaru for the past two days.

255
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,780
He's got snow and a sparrow on his shoulder.

256
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,020
I've tried to talk to him like eight times.

257
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,100
He just looks at me like some sort of weird statue from the movie.

258
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,420
Some sort of weird statue from Labyrinth.

259
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,700
I think we should cut him a deal.

260
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,300
Can we just give him that car for free?

261
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,620
Can we just give him the car?

262
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,660
I hate that Subaru.

263
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,260
I've never liked it being here.

264
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,540
Drive it off the lot.

265
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,060
Get it off the lot, Dave.

266
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,260
Guys, last night, I bit a child.

267
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,820
I have one employee, a young woman, who is kind of a counterculture hippie type.

268
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,380
She's a great employee.

269
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,700
But on warm days, she can have a pretty intense body odor.

270
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,940
She is not dirty.

271
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,300
So I assume she either uses no deodorant or some bullshit crystal thing.

272
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,860
I feel like it needs to be addressed,

273
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,420
but I'm not sure how to raise the issue without making her feel like she's in trouble

274
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,980
or like she's gross or like I'm an asshole.

275
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,060
That's from willing to be an asshole.

276
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,860
If you want a practical solution,

277
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,380
you could try to get an office conversation going between the two of you

278
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,220
about everyone's favorite brand of deodorant.

279
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,060
That could make for an awkward way of bringing up the issue.

280
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,980
I use Mitchum crystals.

281
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,060
Who's up with Mitchum?

282
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,780
Anybody?

283
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,100
You just, you hold them, you hold them like a foot out from your pit

284
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,780
and it just absorbs all this tink away.

285
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,780
And your bad vibes.

286
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,660
And your bad vibes.

287
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,380
Get them out.

288
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,780
I think this is one of those situations where

289
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,460
you should just say it.

290
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,780
You're a boss, you're in a professional setting.

291
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,500
She's got a job and you should just be like,

292
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,060
hey, I'm telling you this as a boss, you stink.

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,540
My employee stink ratio is 100%

294
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,260
because you're my only employee and you stink.

295
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,940
All the people who work at my business stink.

296
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,500
You know, it's, the thing is if she's not,

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,660
if she smells bad, I feel like in this day and age,

298
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,100
if you smell bad, it's not because, it's because of a choice.

299
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,380
You've decided to smell bad, which is not cool for anybody.

300
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,740
But I know they got chemicals in them,

301
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,220
but I'm sure Tom the Maine makes a deodorant you can use.

302
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah, Burt's Bees, Burt's Bees stink wax.

303
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,420
Burt's B-O, I look at her and say,

304
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,260
you don't want to be like Matthew McConaughey, do you?

305
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,140
I don't think so.

306
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,140
Can I give you the actual real answer to this question?

307
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,620
Yeah.

308
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,140
You're not gonna say, God, you're not.

309
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,180
You're gonna live with that.

310
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
And if someone comes into your business

311
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,340
and they look at her and they say,

312
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,980
hey, your employee smells bad, you say, you tell them.

313
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,580
How exactly do you bring that up?

314
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,780
Hey, hey, it smells like a modest Yahoo concert in here.

315
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,460
Do you have a friend or cousin or brother

316
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,500
that's an amateur actor that could dress as a delivery man

317
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,740
and come in with a package and just be like,

318
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,900
woo, you stink, and then you jump to the defense

319
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,540
of this person, like, she's made a choice to stink.

320
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,740
She wants to stink.

321
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,940
I've got a delivery of truth here, C-O-D-U.

322
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,100
And that way you didn't bring it up,

323
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,460
but you started the dialogue.

324
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,940
I think a dialogue is essential, no matter what.

325
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,220
Well, if you have this other person,

326
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,820
there's a tri-a-log at that point.

327
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,060
And one person's an actor.

328
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,420
Oh, you only have one employee,

329
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,620
so what if you went up to her and said,

330
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,900
hey, have you noticed how that girl

331
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,340
in our department really smells?

332
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:08,840
Yeah.

333
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,660
Have you noticed how ingratia smells really bad?

334
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,900
Have you noticed how ingratia smells really bad?

335
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
But my name's ingratia.

336
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,260
Oh, that's weird.

337
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,380
Can you throw some misdirection down

338
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,540
and wait for somebody to come into your store,

339
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,220
which, if she smells this bad,

340
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,900
is not gonna keep happening for much longer.

341
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,900
And when that person leaves, be like,

342
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,700
man, he smelled like body odor really strong.

343
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
And then just constantly throughout the day,

344
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,700
like, man, that man's body odor stink is just sticking around.

345
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
That act could go on for weeks.

346
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,540
Like, I have to call a fucking exorcist

347
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,780
to get that man's smell out of here.

348
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,860
The other thing is,

349
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,220
scentsy, man.

350
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,940
You call my girl Christy,

351
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,420
she's gonna set you up with a scentsy burner,

352
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,580
get you some wafers,

353
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,900
so you get something real nice to melt in there.

354
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,540
What scent wafers are you using this week?

355
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,040
Me?

356
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm using Hide the Hippie and My Dear Watson.

357
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,660
They're my two favorite flavors.

358
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,620
Cloves and cinnamon, and forget she's there.

359
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,260
Those two wafers are the two wafers I'm using.

360
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,380
Uh, I don't mean to,

361
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,500
I don't, I don't want to sound sexist

362
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,260
or set a double standard or something,

363
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,780
but ladies, you are not allowed to smell bad.

364
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,300
You know what?

365
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,900
It makes me so uncomfortable.

366
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,300
Everyone, everyone, you're not allowed to smell bad.

367
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,460
Yeah.

368
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
It makes everyone uncomfortable.

369
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,300
You're right.

370
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,420
Because then everyone knows and no one's saying anything,

371
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,060
and that is the recipe for an awkward situation.

372
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,660
But if a, if a dude sitting next to me on a bus smells bad,

373
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm like, oh man, that dude smells bad.

374
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,700
What a bummer.

375
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,900
But if a lady sits down,

376
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,020
a pretty free-spirited lady sits down next to me

377
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,180
and she smells bad from her armpits,

378
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,980
I, I don't just say, oh, there's a,

379
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,260
there's a lady who smells bad.

380
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,060
It's like, what?

381
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,540
You messed with the whole image at that point.

382
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,980
Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,260
You're throwing Griffin off.

384
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,740
Are hippies walking around thinking like they gotta get,

385
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,620
like they want to get down with people who smell bad?

386
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,260
Is that the thing?

387
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,540
Like, do they like that smell more?

388
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:15,700
Like their musk?

389
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,740
I like your musk.

390
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:16,980
Yeah.

391
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,660
Your musk is so natural.

392
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,060
This is me.

393
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,020
I love it.

394
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,140
You know what you're smelling?

395
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,940
Me.

396
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,500
That's me.

397
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,420
That's what I am and smelling like.

398
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,940
That's why I like Austin so much,

399
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,780
is because there are a lot of hippies here,

400
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,180
but it gets to be about 108 degrees.

401
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,460
And they know, they know,

402
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,860
like they are like, oh, I'm going to put deodorant on.

403
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,460
Like it's against everything I believe in,

404
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,020
but it's 108 goddamn degrees outside.

405
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,780
I can't do that to another person.

406
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,340
But hold on.

407
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,940
But just to get back to this guy's question,

408
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,620
we all agree that as a boss,

409
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,060
he's perfectly within his rights.

410
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,380
Yeah.

411
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,860
So hey, you fucking, you fucking smell bad.

412
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,100
Put deodorant on.

413
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,060
You are my employee.

414
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,660
I pay you and you smell like deodorant.

415
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,180
Put on deodorant or I'll fire you.

416
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,140
Okay.

417
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,300
Don't do it in person.

418
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,660
Give her an employee review

419
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,700
and give personal hygiene a negative four.

420
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,460
If she asks what this is about,

421
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,340
say, what do you think it's about, Ingracia?

422
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,580
You smell like Calamity Cafe.

423
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,540
Get out of here.

424
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,940
Or what about there's a fruit basket with a note on it?

425
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,100
Like for the smelliest kid in the office.

426
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,340
Yeah.

427
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm not sure that that would be.

428
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,620
Yeah, because that's not very nice,

429
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,660
but you get a fruit basket.

430
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,980
It's the only way.

431
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,340
That'll help all the hurt go away.

432
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,180
It's going to soften the blow.

433
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,740
Like, what?

434
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,100
I smell grapes.

435
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,060
That's good, Travis.

436
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,660
Give the bad news a chocolate coating.

437
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,100
Say, I'm giving you a bonus for smelling really bad.

438
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,020
An extra $5 a week to buy deodorant, you smell-o.

439
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,260
Yeah.

440
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm running you to chief smell-o, smell-o.

441
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,060
Get out of here.

442
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,700
Is it possible that she does wear deodorant,

443
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,580
but she just, she's just rank.

444
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,940
Oh, God.

445
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,900
What if it is like a serious medical condition she has

446
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,380
and you're like, hey, why don't you wear deodorant, hippie?

447
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,780
And she's like, I actually have medical strength.

448
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,780
I have prescription deodorant.

449
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,380
I have prescription deodorant.

450
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,420
It's a problem I've dealt with my entire life.

451
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,860
Thank you so much for bringing it up.

452
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,940
I use, I use Old Spice RX.

453
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,180
It's strong enough.

454
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,300
I even had to, I had to fork out extra for New Spice.

455
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,180
It's strong enough.

456
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,660
It's strong enough for a man

457
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
and also strong enough for a woman

458
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,100
with a horrible genetic predisposition

459
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,620
to producing sweat from there.

460
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,900
I had to go out and buy the deodorant

461
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,100
that's strong enough for a bear.

462
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,500
Griffin, how about you treat us to a Yahoo?

463
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,820
Sure.

464
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,100
This one, this one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

465
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,820
Thank you, Krista.

466
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,700
It's by Yahoo!

467
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:41,860
Hey, Krista.

468
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,540
It's her user, Mr. Toucan, who asks,

469
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,220
what if everything was shaped like a penis?

470
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,820
What if everything in the world was shaped like a penis?

471
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,500
Buildings, buses, cars, shoes, fridges, etc.

472
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,460
Would women like that?

473
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,140
I have news for this guy.

474
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,220
Maybe you haven't looked at a skyline recently.

475
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,300
Everything is shaped like a penis.

476
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,460
What's a man's world?

477
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,620
Penis has a tiny radio antenna coming out of the top of it.

478
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,300
So that's, yes.

479
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,460
Right.

480
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,220
I would like to-

481
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,660
To pick up all the vibes the ladies-

482
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,340
I would like to hear this guy's question

483
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,420
and as if he and his friends often like use the phrase,

484
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,620
you know, everything's shaped like a penis.

485
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,060
And then he's like, what if everything was shaped like a penis?

486
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,580
What if literally everything?

487
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,780
What if I was reading this question off a penis-shaped computer?

488
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,780
That's just not the, that's not the best viewing experience, I feel like.

489
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,500
Yeah, no, you-

490
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,660
Also, how would you give directions to anybody?

491
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,420
Just turn left at the penis thing.

492
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,020
I'll meet you by the cock.

493
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,700
Like, I don't know.

494
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,180
I don't know which one, because everything.

495
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,660
You're shaped like a penis.

496
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,020
No, no, the veiny one.

497
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,260
Yeah.

498
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,660
I think my favorite misconception about this

499
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,500
is that women are walking around every day

500
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,420
wishing everything was shaped like a penis.

501
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,420
Man, I sure wish I could see some penis-shaped things today.

502
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,660
Right.

503
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,100
If only this cell phone was shaped like a penis.

504
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,140
Well, this dog biscuit was shaped like a penis.

505
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,300
Although I bet there are probably some angry women somewhere

506
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
that have penis-shaped dog biscuits.

507
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:23,780
But, you know, it would help to lend just an extra air of whimsy to the poster for Shaft.

508
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,140
Just think, wow, that's a ex-

509
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,900
They went really with the extra mile.

510
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,460
But this man wasn't thinking laterally.

511
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,820
Laterally?

512
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,500
He wasn't thinking about-

513
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
He wasn't thinking across all the different possibilities.

514
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,020
You've got to think about the big picture.

515
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,620
We're talking about literature.

516
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,500
We're talking about trying to read a book, but the pages are in the shapes of dicks.

517
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,740
Right.

518
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,340
So you get like two words, three words, three words, three words,

519
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,620
and then like 10 words.

520
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,820
This is the balls.

521
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,300
What if this was like a fucking Twilight Zone episode

522
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,380
and even the words were shaped like dicks?

523
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,580
Travis, this is every-

524
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,060
We could invent a new language where every character was a dick.

525
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,300
So you're saying like the book too would be shaped like a penis, you mean?

526
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,180
That's what I'm saying.

527
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,580
It would be like eat, pray, love, hide it when the kids come in the room.

528
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,260
So basically what it is, is this is a guy who has spent his life,

529
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,380
I don't know, killing dicks or something or just like making fun of dicks,

530
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,540
and then he wakes up one day and he's shaped like a dick

531
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,780
and everything's shaped like a dick and the books are shaped like dicks

532
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,660
and the words are shaped like dicks and like his breakfast is shaped like dicks

533
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,020
and he's just in the middle of town square

534
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,620
spinning around the dick-shaped town square screaming dicks.

535
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,940
Yeah, and then a dick-shaped ghost comes up and is like,

536
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,780
shouldn't have killed all those dicks.

537
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,100
What?

538
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,340
What are you talking about?

539
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,780
Killing dicks?

540
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,020
And then it pulls out two vagina-shaped scientists saying shut it down.

541
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,520
Yeah.

542
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,020
That's my favorite episode.

543
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,900
Twist.

544
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,500
You know, do you know that later Nimoy directed that episode?

545
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,460
A little trivia.

546
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,340
I could tell.

547
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,660
It had a lot of his signature signatures on it.

548
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,620
A lot of signature dicks.

549
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,700
A lot of his signature dicks in it.

550
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,260
A dick-shaped lens on a dick-shaped TV?

551
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,060
Is that what we're doing?

552
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Is that a dick-shaped filter?

553
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,780
I could really tell.

554
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,380
Put it on channel dick dick because the numbers are dicks too, people.

555
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,020
Oh God.

556
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,340
Um, I think that this man's main point is, um, is fallacious.

557
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,900
And that is that, uh, women would like it because I think that after a while,

558
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,540
it wouldn't be like, if every letter in the alphabet looked like a dick,

559
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,300
then when I got a special woman in the bedroom and showed her my treasure,

560
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,500
she'd be like, yep.

561
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,740
Like, what if everything was dick-shaped except dicks?

562
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,300
Yeah.

563
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,140
And your dick was shaped like a sitar maybe or, uh, another-

564
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,220
Sitars kind of look like dicks a little bit.

565
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,740
What if it was like, you could choose it.

566
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,860
Like, you know, maybe you want it to look like, you know, a clownfish.

567
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,180
I don't know.

568
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,660
It's up to you.

569
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,700
Yeah.

570
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,340
Maybe not.

571
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,020
Wait, are they not supposed to look like clownfish?

572
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
I have to go to the doctors.

573
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,660
All the doctors now.

574
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:06,180
Doctor, doctor, my, uh, my treasure looks like Nemo and it's not supposed to.

575
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,660
Can you, um, use all your dick tools that are all shaped like dicks?

576
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,780
Get it from your dick-shaped bag.

577
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,860
Give me the 916th dick, nurse.

578
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,620
God, surgery would be awful, wouldn't it?

579
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,260
Give me that super sharp dick.

580
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,620
No, the Phillips head dick.

581
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,620
This is a flathead dick.

582
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,540
Like Dick Tracy.

583
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,380
What?

584
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:30,900
Gum shoes.

585
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,060
All the Dick Tracy villains would be dick-shaped.

586
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,420
Dick head.

587
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,300
That's why this is my Rose gallery.

588
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,180
Dick head.

589
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,060
Penis face.

590
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,340
Rod pants.

591
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Like this is and mumbles.

592
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,900
Mumbles.

593
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,900
This is, uh, I hope that this is the first episode our grandmother listens to.

594
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,660
Yeah, I heard what you said.

595
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,660
I heard those things.

596
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,140
I heard those things about the dick, the dick world.

597
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,500
Thanksgiving is ruined, boys.

598
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,140
That's my favorite series of fantasy novels.

599
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,100
Right?

600
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,980
Dick world?

601
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,220
Yeah.

602
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,900
Yeah, I really liked the most recent one.

603
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,820
I don't have a punchline.

604
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,940
Which is a great sign that I need to move on to the next question.

605
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,220
One of my best friends moved back to town in order to switch colleges,

606
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,500
and he has been looking for a job ever since.

607
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,100
I recently got my interview at the store I work at, and he landed the job.

608
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,940
It's just a crappy retail job.

609
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,860
When I told my girlfriend this, she voiced her concern that interacting with my friend

610
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,780
in a work environment might adversely affect our relationship.

611
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,660
Now I feel like I just sabotaged my friendship.

612
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,420
Should I not worry about it?

613
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Or should I tell my boss my friend has a drug problem before he stops working?

614
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,060
Help, brothers.

615
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,380
That's friend of the financially flustered in Florida.

616
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,020
Did your friend actually have a drug problem?

617
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah, then it's just full disclosure.

618
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,180
Yeah, then I mean.

619
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,140
Do we need to have a talk?

620
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,300
Well, I think it's fun.

621
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,740
Yeah.

622
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,820
Personally, I mean, I've had friends work at most every job that I've had,

623
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:16,340
and it's nice to have somebody else you can chat about work with outside of the workplace.

624
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,020
I don't think it's damaging at all, really.

625
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,340
The only time that it ever affected me adversely is when I worked at Best Buy and I was,

626
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,020
you know, I was trying to get promoted.

627
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,780
I was trying to get that cheddar and I was taking it far too seriously.

628
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,820
And I worked with my dear, dear friend Michael Bradbury, who is kind of a goofball.

629
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,140
And people would constantly.

630
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,780
Yeah, he is.

631
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,900
He's a cat bird.

632
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,260
And people would often my bosses would be like, Hey, where's Bradbury?

633
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,180
He's three and a half hours late or whatever.

634
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,060
And I don't know.

635
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,100
I'm like, he's your friend.

636
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,580
Then then it was kind of a bummer.

637
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,380
You wouldn't throw him under the bus for corporate gain?

638
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,940
Fuck no.

639
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,860
I'm for Best Buy.

640
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,060
He's my BFF.

641
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,860
I've gotten many of many a friend hired at the institution I work with.

642
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,100
There is always the danger.

643
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I mean, I think that's the bigger worry than.

644
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:14,180
I think that's a bigger worry than, you know, your friendship going to pot is your boss.

645
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,900
You know, the first time they fuck up, your boss coming to you and saying,

646
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,820
Hey, you're so your friend is working out really bad.

647
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,740
I don't like how they stock anything.

648
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,340
Your friend's body odor is boomastic.

649
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,300
Can you talk to you?

650
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh, my God.

651
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
Your big shaped friend.

652
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I got the answer, guys.

653
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,780
The guy needs to hire someone else.

654
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,900
He needs to hire a second employee and then fire them for being rude and commenting on

655
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,700
her body odor.

656
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,180
Do you have a friend or cousin that's an amateur actor?

657
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,220
Do you have a friend?

658
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,740
Do you just have it has to be just an outspoken.

659
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,580
Can you an outspoken person?

660
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,140
Like you can get Jack to come.

661
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,220
Can you hire Star Jones for a week?

662
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,220
And if your friend is Star Jones, then I wouldn't worry too much about getting them hired because

663
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,780
she's got enough charisma to light up a room.

664
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,260
She's going to get to get on her own and there's not going to be any problems there.

665
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,620
I've worked with my brother for four years.

666
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,980
Yeah, well, we do it remotely, but still, yeah.

667
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Yeah, it's brought us together.

668
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,100
I work with a lot of friends.

669
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,700
You know, I don't think it's an inherent problem.

670
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,980
I think I'm trying to see what the problem would be if you don't care about your job.

671
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,340
If you care about your job, but you describe it as a crappy retail job.

672
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,460
Like, what are you going to lose?

673
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,980
You know, as long as you keep your head clear and you're like, this is my best friend.

674
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,780
I'm just happy to get to like hang out with him at work.

675
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,460
Also, if it's a crappy retail job and you have a new guy in there who's your buddy,

676
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,700
then you have two people to plan Ocean's Eleven-esque heists with because that's the

677
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,780
only reason people have retail jobs anymore, right?

678
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,380
It's just, it's just to steal, just to steal, hand over.

679
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,580
Yeah, I got fired for stealing at Blockbuster.

680
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,420
Oh, please, please tell this story.

681
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,560
What?

682
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,180
You got to tell everyone what you stole.

683
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,900
So I, things got really rugged towards the last few months of my tenure at Blockbuster.

684
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:16,660
And you know how you can sell, you know, people have late fees and you can put on your computer

685
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,580
and dismiss them, but you can do that with like, you could sell things to your account,

686
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:22,820
right?

687
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,500
So like if they didn't return the movie, you could sell the movie to their account

688
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,980
and then it shows up like late fee basically and you clear the late fee and you can steal

689
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,780
things that way.

690
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:39,860
And the special edition of Fight Club came out and I sold it to my account and then I

691
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,140
deleted my late fees.

692
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:48,340
And as it turned out, that copy was the, the copy that I sold to my account was the boss's

693
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,180
copy that he had reserved to buy himself.

694
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,140
So what I had done was I had stolen my boss's copy of Fight Club.

695
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:04,100
Now, I tell this story not to talk about my own failings as a human being because I think

696
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,580
we've all got dark things in our past.

697
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,080
Sure.

698
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,940
I tell this story to demonstrate how little he really understood the concepts being espoused

699
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,980
in Fight Club.

700
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,500
He should have celebrated.

701
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,660
I feel like a true fan would have really enjoyed what I was trying to do there.

702
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Can I ask, can I ask a question?

703
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,460
Please, yeah.

704
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,500
This whole scenario, it's very clever.

705
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,740
Why didn't you just stick Fight Club down your pants and leave the store?

706
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:46,860
Well, A, okay, A, cameras, B, I'm a husky guy, I don't have a lot of room in there.

707
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,900
And that's first degree stealing.

708
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,620
The thing is, that's first degree stealing, Griffin.

709
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,740
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do that.

710
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,900
This was Ocean's Eleven style stealing and I like it.

711
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,340
Now, should I have sold it to an account that did not explicitly have my name on it?

712
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,840
Maybe.

713
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
That's quite a paper trail there, McElroy.

714
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,340
Hindsight and all that.

715
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
And you would have gotten away with it too.

716
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Well, no, if I'd had a best friend working there, they could have helped me plot through

717
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,060
the details.

718
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:23,660
They could have said like, hey, that belongs to Philip and he does not really understand

719
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,220
the movie.

720
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,260
He is your employer.

721
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,580
You should remove the sticker that says this is stolen from the cassette tape.

722
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,260
So, first day of your friend working this job, pull him into the back room and be like,

723
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,820
listen, I hired you for one reason and one reason only.

724
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,980
I got you this job so you could help me steal some movies and stuff.

725
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,380
You're our man on the inside.

726
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,380
We're taking this bathroom body works apart, piece by piece.

727
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,780
I brought you here for one reason and one reason only so you can watch for the boss

728
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,540
while I huff off the helium tank.

729
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,900
That is another thing I used to do at Blockbuster.

730
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,180
That is, I do not have a good defense for it.

731
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,700
I thought that you-

732
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,820
I was the watch guard.

733
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,980
I should point out my friend Jimmy is the one who would get high and black out just

734
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,420
in a big pile of MRAs.

735
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:20,380
I always thought that the film that you acquired, which was your downfall, was Showgirls.

736
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,740
I always thought that was the case.

737
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
No, it was Fight Club, which makes the irony.

738
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:31,420
I mean, I feel like if I walked out with Showgirls, I would have been embarrassed.

739
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,380
But Fight Club, I feel like, what would Tyler Durden do?

740
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,300
That was it.

741
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,380
And by the way, I apparently bought into that mythos a little bit too much as a young man.

742
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,820
I think we all did as young men.

743
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,540
I remember watching that film and then I went and I got in a shower and I just turned the

744
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,820
heat up as hot as it could go.

745
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,260
Like, yeah, the pain is real.

746
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,780
Like, it's not real.

747
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,420
I mean, it is real.

748
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,980
It just hurts.

749
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,740
I watched that movie and then I got fired from my job at the dog kennel for stealing dogs.

750
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,240
Yeah.

751
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,260
No.

752
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,780
You can put them down your pants, tough guy.

753
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,140
You got fired from the dog kennel because you didn't want to clean out dog buttholes.

754
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,900
I refuse to squeeze buttholes.

755
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,380
I don't think that's a revolutionary concept.

756
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,780
I thought I was taking a fucking stand being like, no, I will not squeeze that dog's butthole.

757
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,300
This is like dog equal rights.

758
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,220
I wouldn't want someone squeezing my butthole doing to others.

759
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,420
Hey, there you go.

760
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,980
Say, Ingracia, can you come into my office?

761
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,100
I think you may need to go have your anal gland professionally squeezed because you do

762
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,980
smell very bad.

763
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,780
I believe something on you needs to be expressed.

764
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,020
Don't do that.

765
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,580
Don't do that.

766
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,380
That won't work either.

767
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,100
I'm pretty sure if you say that sentence to a woman, you go to jail.

768
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,860
Hey, there's this girl I like at school and before she goes to her class, we usually hug.

769
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,980
The problem is that when we hug, I usually have an increased amount of blood flow to

770
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,500
my nether region.

771
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,540
I am worried that she will feel it while we're hugging and end up thinking that I am perverted,

772
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,140
but I can't really control it.

773
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,620
Is there a way to stop my mini me from rising to the occasion as from concern in California?

774
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,460
I wish we got more questions like that.

775
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,060
I love this honesty.

776
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,860
I can't.

777
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,740
There were more ways to say this man had an erection without saying that he had an erection

778
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,900
that made me so uncomfortable that I could count.

779
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,540
Why are you hugging?

780
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,820
That's the thing I can't get away from.

781
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,900
You're sitting there and it's before school and she has to go to class so you hug goodbye?

782
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,340
Why are you hugging?

783
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,620
Travis, that's the most goddamn beautiful thing I've ever heard.

784
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,820
I don't want to crush it.

785
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,620
Is he an 80 year old man pretending to be a kid in school?

786
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,460
That's a weird thing to do if it's just your friend.

787
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,220
Is she your lady?

788
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,260
You're making it sound like 8 o'clock, it's hug time, he says they usually hug.

789
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,060
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

790
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,300
He doesn't force her to do it if she's uncomfortable.

791
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:16,220
Travis, if this is a thing that has happened before, you pop in an instant chubby in this

792
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,260
embrace, an instant embrace chubby, and she keeps hugging you.

793
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,420
Maybe your boner knows something she doesn't.

794
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,780
Your boner is the only one thinking through this situation.

795
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,540
I think it's time to show her the clown fish.

796
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:41,100
Give her the old sitar, give her the sitar sighting.

797
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,180
She deserves it.

798
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,860
You know what?

799
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,020
Boners are beautiful and that's a way of life, especially when you're in school.

800
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,300
Just get the boner.

801
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,660
I wish I could still get a boner.

802
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,440
Nonsense.

803
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,540
Instead of rubbing it in people's faces.

804
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,260
Not sense the fire, as Justin enjoyed that feeling.

805
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Yeah, I can't get a boner anymore.

806
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,380
Maybe, maybe just go for it, and next time you do it, just hug her real close.

807
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,020
Here's the problem.

808
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,540
Oh boy, you like that?

809
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:18,940
That's good.

810
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,020
That's not at all like sexual harassment.

811
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,520
Nope.

812
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,500
You get boners when you're in high school.

813
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,540
They just happen.

814
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,140
They, they, they apparate, like Harry Potter.

815
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,940
You get assigned boners like you do a locker combination.

816
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:44,300
I do enjoy though that we, I, why do we have classes in algebra two and trigonometry when

817
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,340
hiding boners is not on the menu?

818
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,460
And it should be.

819
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,580
How to handle your boner.

820
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,460
You do not.

821
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,260
It was an elective for me, but I mean, I took it.

822
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,380
I wasn't on that track, no.

823
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,020
I had a home ec instead.

824
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,140
I had cooking.

825
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,460
I took hiding the boner AP, so I got college credit for it.

826
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,180
That's nice.

827
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,740
That's nice.

828
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,860
I took how to cook with your boner.

829
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,860
I just combined the two.

830
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,460
It was a special track I created.

831
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,420
Okay, double credit.

832
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,060
Here's the deal.

833
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,780
I think that what I said before, I'm sticking with.

834
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,100
I think it's time for you to make a move.

835
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,860
Either poop or get off the pot and tell this girl you're interested in it.

836
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,620
Start using those boners for good.

837
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,300
He doesn't necessarily have to be interested in her to get a boner.

838
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,500
I got a boner.

839
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,740
But he says there's this girl I like at school.

840
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,100
He likes her.

841
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,940
Yeah, I got boners every day in Spanish class in high school.

842
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,820
And it wasn't because I had a busty teacher.

843
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,820
But like apropos of nothing?

844
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,020
Just the only thing I can think is that it's a romance language.

845
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,460
And that fact in and of itself is enough to stiffen.

846
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,940
But I say if he likes this girl, if he's hugging her and getting the bone,

847
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,940
then he needs to be like, hey, let's go see a movie.

848
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,020
Travis, he could have a binder resting on his lap and get a boner.

849
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
It has nothing to do with him liking this girl.

850
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,260
He likes having a warm, soft surface to press up against.

851
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,820
I see what you're saying.

852
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,140
But he needs one of those microwavable bean bags.

853
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,820
He needs to desensitize himself.

854
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,540
Yeah, he needs a sumo chair that he can really explore.

855
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,580
He needs to explore his body on a sumo chair.

856
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,700
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

857
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,060
Yeah.

858
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,340
Can I say Yahoo me?

859
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,620
No.

860
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,180
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield or Holifield.

861
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,460
I haven't decided yet.

862
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,020
It's by Yahoo.

863
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,340
The time is coming up.

864
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,620
The time is fast approaching.

865
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,820
You need to make that decision.

866
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:57,020
That's why Yahoo answers user Loser who asks, what insults have you called your pet?

867
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,060
My uncle just called his kitten a dumb bitch whore.

868
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,260
How have you or your loved ones insulted your pets?

869
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,220
I love animals.

870
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,420
I'm not mean to pets.

871
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,460
I just think it's funny calling them names behind their backs when gossiping.

872
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,060
Wait, what?

873
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,820
Excuse me?

874
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,260
Gossiping about the pets?

875
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,180
Hey, have you noticed how fat Whiskers has been getting?

876
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,620
Look at how trophy Whiskers smells like he has BO.

877
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,620
Who's going to tell him?

878
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,500
Using crystals Whiskers?

879
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:33,260
I hear Professor Mittens will go down on any cat with just a little bit of nip.

880
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,580
Yeah, all it takes.

881
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,380
Hey, hey, hey, everybody.

882
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,460
If you want to gossip to your cat or gossip about your pets,

883
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,300
just do it to their goddamn faces.

884
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,140
Yeah, you're stupid.

885
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,380
Pringles, Pringles, you are a slut.

886
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,940
Oh, God.

887
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,540
Nobody likes you, Rufy.

888
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,820
Rufy?

889
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,500
Rufio?

890
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,020
It's short for Rufio.

891
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,500
Okay.

892
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,580
Hey, Lord Barkington, mayor of Pubbyshire, come over here real quick.

893
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,380
You're adopted.

894
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,180
Oh, shit.

895
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,220
Not that there's anything wrong with being adopted.

896
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,580
Isn't every dog adopted?

897
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,740
Some are birth dogs.

898
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,980
Hey, Lord Edward Bark, get over here.

899
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,700
You're a dick.

900
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,940
I hate you.

901
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,620
Why don't you just name your cat Fartface?

902
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,340
They don't know.

903
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,140
They'll answer to anything.

904
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,020
They don't care.

905
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:43,980
I wish I lived a life free of fear that was conducive to me calling other people's pets names.

906
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,580
Oh, my.

907
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,580
You know what I mean?

908
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:53,020
Like, if I could just go to Justin's house and then go right, like, hey, hey, it's good to see you.

909
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,220
Oh, yeah, I know.

910
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,420
I haven't seen you in so long.

911
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,260
What's up, you fat slut?

912
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,900
Here's the catch about gossiping about your pets.

913
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,980
First off, that's something a crazy person does.

914
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:15,260
More importantly, though, what burn are you going to lay on your cat that is equal to

915
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,660
scooping their poop?

916
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,100
Like, oh, yeah, pretty good one.

917
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,380
Pretty good one, Justin.

918
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,300
Did you want to go scoop some of my feces out of sand?

919
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,460
Because that's what you're doing this afternoon.

920
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,740
Me? Me? I'm going to lay on this chair and shed.

921
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,100
What I do is I routinely withhold food from my cat.

922
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,340
Not forever, just for like a half hour.

923
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,980
Just like a half hour, an hour when I know she's really hungry.

924
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,060
And then I tell her that I don't want to feed her because she's getting fat.

925
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,740
And then eventually I do feed her.

926
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,980
But I do it saying, all right, if you want to get fat.

927
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,140
You have a weird relationship, huh?

928
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,060
Well, I don't want the cat to like me.

929
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,340
I don't like the cat.

930
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,460
It's Teresa's cat.

931
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,740
I don't like you.

932
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,140
You want the cat to be the greatest ballerina.

933
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,060
Listen, she's got the skills.

934
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,180
She's got the talent.

935
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,700
She just needs the drive.

936
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
That's what I'm here for, huh?

937
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,620
Your apartment sounds like Guantanamo Bay for cats.

938
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,020
She may not thank you someday, but the world will thank you.

939
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,660
For giving the greatest cat ballerina.

940
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,860
I am routinely also training my cat to make hilarious cat videos to the internet.

941
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
It's basically like a boot camp for that.

942
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,700
Can the cat upload them?

943
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,060
Yeah.

944
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,940
You guys know Maru?

945
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,620
If she wants to get fed, she will.

946
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,660
You guys know Maru?

947
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,300
Maru was beaten to sleep every night as a baby, as a tiny cat, as a child.

948
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,420
Child cat.

949
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,860
It's a cat child.

950
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,540
I hear.

951
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,060
I hear she's a real bitch and a real dynamo in a sack.

952
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,660
Here's my one problem with this, and we can make fun of this as much as we want.

953
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:16,300
I can never shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe, that cat or dog that I'm making

954
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,900
fun of is a witch's familiar.

955
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,460
Yeah.

956
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,900
Oh God, that's such a present problem today.

957
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,860
I know.

958
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,900
What if?

959
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,460
What if?

960
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
I'm like, get out of here, you fat, lazy bitch.

961
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,700
Yeah.

962
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,980
And then she goes back to her witch and I get cursed.

963
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,660
Or what if she is a witch?

964
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,100
That's what I'm saying.

965
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,220
What if it's Kathy Najimy just transformed, made feline, and you made fun of her?

966
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,020
Oh God, it's Sarah Jessica Parker, everyone duck.

967
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,500
I'm sorry.

968
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,860
No, wait a second.

969
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,780
Is she a witch?

970
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,260
Sarah Jessica, SJP?

971
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:49,900
Yeah.

972
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,780
SJP, Kathy Najimy, and Bette Midler.

973
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,620
That's Team Hocus Pocus.

974
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,260
That's my new bar trivia name.

975
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,260
We're Team Pocus.

976
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,220
I actually am feeling right now like Griffin has not seen the film Hocus Pocus.

977
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,500
I think that's what we're getting at.

978
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,540
Griffin, I need confirmation that you've seen Hocus Pocus.

979
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,500
I've seen Hocus Pocus.

980
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,100
What's the name of the cat?

981
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,980
Welcome to our new show, Hocus Pocus Trivia.

982
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,620
It's called Hocus Jocus.

983
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,100
It's a comedy podcast about Hocus Pocus, the movie.

984
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,340
I thought, and I was ready to go on this trip with you, Travis,

985
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,700
that you were saying Sarah Jessica Parker is a literal witch.

986
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,460
She has literal children's bones in her house that she uses to cast spells.

987
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,180
Listen, I'm not ready to say that.

988
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,580
I'm saying nobody can apparently prove that she doesn't cast the black art.

989
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,820
I'm going to say that I don't not know for certain that she's not a witch.

990
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,820
I think if you're saying looks alone,

991
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,020
which Hollywood celebs look like witches, it's-

992
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,900
Laura Flynn Boyle.

993
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,260
Laura Flynn Boyle, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Blythe Danner.

994
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,980
And Dakota Fanning.

995
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,420
Dakota Fanning is a witch baby.

996
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,260
Oh, you think she's like aging in reverse?

997
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,700
Right, yeah.

998
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,100
That's what all witches age in reverse.

999
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,540
And of course, Brad Pitt is a warlock because his looks are magical.

1000
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,340
Okay.

1001
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm saying it's not just looks, I'm saying if there's a person on this planet

1002
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,020
who bakes children into pastries-

1003
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,420
And then doesn't eat them.

1004
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,060
And then does not eat them, it is Sarah Jessica Parker.

1005
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,980
That's wasteful.

1006
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,220
Hey, my wife has been together for seven years.

1007
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,020
There are children starving in Africa that you could bake into things.

1008
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,900
My wife and I have been together for seven years,

1009
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,260
and for seven years I've been an utter disappointment on the dance floor.

1010
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,580
Whenever we go out, I usually end up just hanging at the bar

1011
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,860
while she dances with her friends.

1012
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,340
She says it's not a big deal,

1013
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,420
but I would love to be able to enjoy a night out with my wife

1014
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,500
without being the awkward guy at the bar.

1015
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,580
Should I take measures to learn to dance

1016
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,020
or just embrace my role as that guy that can dance?

1017
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,420
At least two left feet, maybe more.

1018
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,540
That's the name of that question to ask her.

1019
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,380
Hey, Broseph, here's the thing.

1020
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,860
The only person that thinks you can't dance is you.

1021
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,260
Oh, yeah, I think you can dance.

1022
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,460
I don't know what skills people think everyone else has

1023
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,780
when they say like, I can't dance, I'm not a good dancer.

1024
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,780
Have you watched anyone else dance?

1025
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,860
Dancing, you used to be able to use that.

1026
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,100
I don't think people get this.

1027
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,700
When you see someone like in an old movie or something say, I can't dance.

1028
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,500
What they mean is like, they don't know how to-

1029
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,660
I literally haven't been trained on the steps

1030
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,740
of the cha-cha and the bunny hop that everyone else knows.

1031
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,580
I don't know the foxtrot, I don't know.

1032
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,300
Today, people just look like they're cooking.

1033
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,060
If you stand and to the rhythm look like you're like

1034
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,500
stirring some mashed potatoes or mashing some potatoes

1035
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,700
or eating mashed potatoes, like any one of those-

1036
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,460
Yeah, any mashed potato based move is gonna help you out.

1037
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,100
Plugging in the beer.

1038
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,220
Instant mashed potatoes.

1039
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,700
Plugging in the beer to whip up mashed potatoes.

1040
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,660
The gravy pour, the gravy pour, the gravy pour.

1041
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,060
Spice them up right, spice them up right, spice them up right.

1042
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,580
Right, like chunky, chunky, chunky mashed potatoes.

1043
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,700
Add the cream, add the cream.

1044
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,780
Ah, ah, ah, add the cream, add the cream.

1045
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,900
This just became a crimp and I'm so happy about it.

1046
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,740
Can I give you the real secret?

1047
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,980
Can I give you my secret stuff?

1048
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,580
It can be all your dancing secrets.

1049
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,700
Here's my secret stuff.

1050
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,580
This is a true story.

1051
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,940
So last night I went to a party where I did not know many people

1052
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,060
and I was sort of nervous.

1053
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,300
And then-

1054
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,740
By the way, if you don't know any McElroys very well,

1055
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,300
I do not know many people is how every story of us getting too drunk starts.

1056
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,620
So what happened next was I got too drunk.

1057
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:50,860
And then I started dancing so hard that my wallet fell out of my pants.

1058
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:57,660
So I went from, oh, I don't, I'm so, I'm kind of nervous to be here

1059
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,060
because I don't know any glug, glug, glug.

1060
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,140
Hey, where's my wallet?

1061
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,420
Courage, courage, courage.

1062
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,220
I danced so hard.

1063
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:11,020
Listen, take a page out of middle school and high school, Travis,

1064
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,700
and learn to dance, go to your wife, who is dancing,

1065
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,180
grasp her by the hips, and then just do whatever she does.

1066
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,100
Just backwards.

1067
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,300
Yeah, just shadow her.

1068
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,140
Whatever she does, you lock on and you do that.

1069
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,700
Or you could just, the other thing you could do is

1070
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:36,540
is some men take out this route, this, sorry, I got an email that was distracting.

1071
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,180
What you could do is you could just, and this works for some men,

1072
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,980
I can't pull it off because people expect moves from me,

1073
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,180
but some men just get out on the dance floor with their ladies

1074
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,900
and they just sort of stand there like a maple for their lady to dance around.

1075
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,420
You could do what our dear friend Bobby Glasser does,

1076
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,620
which is get out there and just fucking pull moves like Jagger.

1077
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,220
Just sway, go to town.

1078
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,580
Shimmy, shake.

1079
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
Just so little is expected from you.

1080
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,300
It really is.

1081
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,420
Most dancing, especially the dancing that guys do in this sort of scenario,

1082
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,140
is basically just listening to the music really hard.

1083
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,460
You look like you're really listening to it, like man,

1084
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,060
I'm hearing every beat of this.

1085
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,740
Maybe you gotta pee a little bit so you're kind of shifting.

1086
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,860
Right, yes, exactly.

1087
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,740
If you make really intense noises, people are just gonna think

1088
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,540
you're dancing really good, like ah, fuck.

1089
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,460
You don't even have to move your feet.

1090
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,300
And if you get lost, this is pretty easy actually,

1091
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,700
if you don't know the next move, you raise your hand up in the air and say,

1092
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,380
aw shit, this might jam.

1093
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,900
Most people who used to do that, it's a stall.

1094
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,340
They're thinking of the next move they're gonna do.

1095
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,780
There's a common rookie mistake, don't start singing along to the song.

1096
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,260
That is a dead giveaway that you don't know what you're doing.

1097
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,980
That is middle school hijinks.

1098
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,860
Sing one, like three or four words that really resonate with you.

1099
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,500
You know what I mean?

1100
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,000
Yes.

1101
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:03,100
So you'll be like, ow, on that September day,

1102
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,900
and the whole crowd will just raise their hands with you.

1103
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:06,940
Yeah.

1104
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,440
You know?

1105
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,740
Like if you listen to Alex Jackson music.

1106
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,660
And then when the music ends,

1107
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,820
and the next song starts that you're not comfortable with,

1108
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,260
dip out to get another drink.

1109
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:15,420
Yeah.

1110
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,500
It's like, oh, I gotta take a break.

1111
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,500
Too hard.

1112
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,140
I'm saying, you're never gonna get better sitting at the bar.

1113
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:22,860
Don't sit at the bar.

1114
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,620
You might feel foolish the first couple times you go out there,

1115
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,980
but no one's looking at you.

1116
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,220
No one gives two shits about what you're doing,

1117
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,140
because they're all thinking about how awkward they look.

1118
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,640
Right.

1119
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,180
I cut my dancing teeth at a bar in Huntington called Club Echo.

1120
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,180
On Saturday nights, they would have $5 pitchers of mixed drinks.

1121
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:47,820
And I would get so tipsy topsy turvy on Long Island iced tea,

1122
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,500
and then it wasn't up to me anymore.

1123
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,980
Like-

1124
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,580
No, then you get taken over by the rhythm.

1125
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:53,820
Yeah.

1126
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,540
Right.

1127
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,060
They'll let the rhythm move you.

1128
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,420
And once you do enough of that,

1129
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,780
then I think you can start dancing sans booze.

1130
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,020
Just not when you're-

1131
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,660
Don't ever.

1132
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,500
Don't ever dance sans booze.

1133
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,100
No, and your wife loves you.

1134
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,100
She doesn't care if you look foolish or not.

1135
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,260
And she's probably worried about how foolish she looks.

1136
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,220
Don't worry about it, dude.

1137
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,500
Hey, guy, if you're not out there,

1138
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,820
if you're not gonna go out there and you're gonna lose her.

1139
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,140
Yeah.

1140
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,340
You're not a loser, are you?

1141
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,380
Here's, I think that-

1142
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,100
That guy?

1143
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,060
Slick moves?

1144
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,780
Dancing, for men, is almost always an act of contrition.

1145
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,700
I feel like, it's like I'm bringing myself to this shame level

1146
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,860
for you because I love you so much.

1147
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,380
Look at me move.

1148
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,540
Look at my big dumb body move.

1149
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,820
Look at my stupid, stupid flesh just jiggle for you.

1150
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,500
I hate you.

1151
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:41,980
I love you.

1152
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,780
But I love you.

1153
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,540
And then if you find a weird move that you can do,

1154
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,220
just scream like, this is the Todd.

1155
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,900
Everybody knew the Todd.

1156
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,700
There is always the risk that you are going to start a dance craze.

1157
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,140
That fear is present.

1158
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,180
Guys, real quick.

1159
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,180
Rachel Branson sent in this Yahoo answer.

1160
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user D, who wants to know,

1161
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,940
if you knew you was about to die, what would be your last meal?

1162
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,300
I was thinking, if I ever get the death sentence,

1163
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,340
what would be my last meal?

1164
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,020
I'm wondering what other people would have.

1165
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,100
I was thinking a double, an extra large double bacon cheeseburger meal,

1166
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,460
supersized from Burger King.

1167
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,900
But what to have for dessert?

1168
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,340
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

1169
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,140
Why are you sad?

1170
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,620
You know what?

1171
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,180
The irony is that if you have a double bacon supersized chunder meal

1172
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,180
from Burger King, that will be your last meal.

1173
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,020
You're as good as dead anyway.

1174
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,500
A chunder blender from Burger King.

1175
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,540
I prefer to go to Outback and get the chunder from Down Under.

1176
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,860
What did you get at Burger King?

1177
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,420
A mistake.

1178
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,980
But that's okay.

1179
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,220
You get one last meal and you can pick from anything.

1180
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,980
And right after that, you're going to be killed.

1181
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,860
What do you want?

1182
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,900
Some Burger King.

1183
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,300
Yeah.

1184
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,220
Can you get me some Burger King?

1185
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,740
Can you tip down to BK and get me some twists?

1186
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,420
The only thing I can think is that that is a play.

1187
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,540
You're making a play so that the governor feels so bad for you

1188
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,820
that he decides not to kill you because you're already dead inside.

1189
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,060
Right.

1190
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:07,900
Yeah.

1191
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,100
What did she ask for?

1192
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,060
She asked for Burger-

1193
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,380
Okay.

1194
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,100
I'm going to give a stay of execution here so I can talk to her.

1195
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,300
I want to find out what's up with this girl.

1196
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,580
She asked for shitty fish sticks that her mom made in an oven.

1197
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,140
Can I get some of those crown-shaped chicken tenders?

1198
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,860
And the crown so everybody knows I'm-

1199
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,300
So I can sit on my electric throne.

1200
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,220
I want to be the king of dead.

1201
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,460
I used to be the king of rape murder and now I will be the king of heaven.

1202
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,380
Do they still have those Oreo Blast things?

1203
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,260
They give you an Oreo Blast and an execution crown.

1204
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,380
What's up, Jesus?

1205
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,820
Sorry, bro.

1206
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,540
Check the crown.

1207
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,300
Oh my god.

1208
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,260
Wheels and the rest of the BK Kids Club is here.

1209
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,460
They're all here welcoming me in.

1210
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,580
Welcome me in.

1211
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,100
Fly me to heaven, big kid.

1212
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,860
You die looking at the picture of the BK Kids Club like Susan Sarandon.

1213
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,700
The last face you see is going to be a face of love from wheels and goggles.

1214
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,380
But why is wheels in heaven still in a wheelchair?

1215
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,060
Wait a minute.

1216
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,380
You mean it was an act this whole time?

1217
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,460
I wish I'd rape murdered you too, wheels.

1218
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,260
My one regret-

1219
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,460
Do you have any last words?

1220
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,180
Yeah, I wish I'd killed the Burger King Kids Club.

1221
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,780
They're a bunch of fucking pros.

1222
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,500
What are you-

1223
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,620
What are you in for?

1224
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,100
Oh god.

1225
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,940
I killed the Burger King Kids Club.

1226
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,780
I wish I hadn't touched Grimace.

1227
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,860
I wish I would have saved it for the Kids Club.

1228
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,860
Oh god.

1229
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,940
Hey, hey Burger King Kids Club.

1230
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,540
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1231
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:55,100
First, first housekeeping, mbnbam.com is our website.

1232
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,540
We are hugely appreciative of-

1233
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,020
I thought you were going to say we're hugely popular.

1234
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,420
We're hugely popular on the internet.

1235
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:03,820
Thank you to-

1236
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,700
We're real big.

1237
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,060
We're real big.

1238
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,500
Office underscore Memo has been tweeting about the show.

1239
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,620
Our buddy Chunky Mouth, Andrew Peters 88,

1240
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,860
Xmaster BX, Tobacco, Andy Hunt.

1241
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,740
Got some new people.

1242
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,180
Did you guys see any new converts?

1243
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,900
People who had been putting it off and then finally got on board?

1244
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,620
Randy Jackson.

1245
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,580
Randy Jackson finally put down the base and picked up an iPod

1246
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,460
and listened to our show.

1247
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,500
So I appreciate that.

1248
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,380
Weird Viking, thank you for tweeting about the show.

1249
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,020
Thank you to everybody who hadn't been listening before,

1250
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,140
who just started spreading the word.

1251
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,420
And for those about to listen, we salute you.

1252
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,180
Our old friend Casey Green still spreading the word.

1253
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,460
So thank you to everyone.

1254
00:57:54,460 --> 00:58:00,220
That's really the only way our show grows is by telling people about the show.

1255
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:09,100
I also want to mention real quick our buddy Bob Ball,

1256
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,900
whose dulcet tones you hear starting the show every week.

1257
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,500
He's got a new show that's a lot of fun called Pop Quizical.

1258
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,060
You can just search for that all one word on iTunes

1259
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,660
or he's actually on Twitter under that same handle.

1260
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,020
But it's a really short trivia show where he does a specific topic every week

1261
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:34,380
and then you test yourself to see how well you can answer his questions.

1262
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,740
It's about Nile Living Dead this week.

1263
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,220
It's really good.

1264
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,060
I really do.

1265
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,820
It's very well produced too, which I like.

1266
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,940
It sounds like that, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I need it.

1267
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,420
What is it?

1268
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,420
Wait, wait, I should know.

1269
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,380
Wait, wait, don't do it.

1270
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1271
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:50,860
Don't do it.

1272
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,460
Don't kill wheels.

1273
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:57,260
Don't rape, murder the Bird King Kids Club.

1274
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,460
Oh, and mace in your face.

1275
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,700
And always Amy H spreading the gospel as it were.

1276
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,860
And congratulations to Church's wife who was our thousandth tweet.

1277
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,540
Girl Casey said thank you and congratulations.

1278
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,700
I want to thank John Roderick real quick.

1279
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,060
Can I do that?

1280
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,660
Yeah, we got time.

1281
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,740
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1282
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,780
It's a departure.

1283
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,860
You can find that tune and many other amazing tunes on the album,

1284
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,820
putting the days to bed.

1285
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,020
Yeah, you should go pick up that whole discography.

1286
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:41,580
Oh, if you've got a query, something in your life that you need a little help with,

1287
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,060
why don't you email us in bmbm at maximumfund.org.

1288
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,500
Email us and just say, hey guys, I've got a short question and I need you to answer it.

1289
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Maybe we will.

1290
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:50,780
Who knows?

1291
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,620
It's hard to say, you know?

1292
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,380
If you attach a dollar bill on there.

1293
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,060
Couldn't hurt.

1294
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,180
Slide a picture of a dollar bill in and we'll see what we can work out for you.

1295
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:04,060
Griffin, I think it's time for the last.

1296
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,660
Sorry, I know our new shirt isn't up yet, but it'll be up soon.

1297
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,100
I promise.

1298
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:17,100
Or just ask the people on Topo Taco on Tubatico on the internet.

1299
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,220
Say, hey guys, where's that new shirt?

1300
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,420
Hey guys, what the fuck?

1301
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,660
What the fuck?

1302
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,140
Everyone, we want to see your Halloween costumes this year, so make sure you tweet them out.

1303
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,820
Maybe you want to attach MBMBAM to there and we can see them.

1304
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,940
Yeah, do that.

1305
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,620
Put that in the hashtags so we can see them.

1306
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,740
If you go in a My Brother and My Brother and Me themed Halloween costume,

1307
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,460
I will say your name on this program.

1308
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:41,820
Boom.

1309
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,460
There it is.

1310
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,180
There it is.

1311
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:43,660
Deal with it.

1312
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,180
And if you can get two friends and you can cosplay as us, all the better.

1313
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,220
I will lose my mind if you do that.

1314
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,860
But don't just take a picture of you and two friends and say, oh, it's us.

1315
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,620
I want to see distinguishing features.

1316
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:55,900
Yeah.

1317
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,700
Or anybody.

1318
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,060
Go as Hey Jeffrey if you want.

1319
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:58,460
I don't care.

1320
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:58,620
Yeah.

1321
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,500
If you wear a Jeffrey costume, you are not getting any dream.

1322
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,460
If you go as a horny ghost horse, I will hug you next time I see you.

1323
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,820
Not if you're wearing that costume, though.

1324
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:09,740
Griffin.

1325
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,300
This final question was sent in by Lisa Nikolai.

1326
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,100
Thank you, Lisa.

1327
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:20,940
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark, who asks, thanks for pooping in my car, Wendy.

1328
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,380
Thank God I had leather seats.

1329
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,100
What should I do?

1330
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,140
I'm Justin McElroy.

1331
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,380
I'm Travis McElroy.

1332
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,820
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1333
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,860
Kiss your dad.

1334
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,220
Swear on the lips.

1335
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,580
Keep your heart three stacks.

1336
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,620
Keep your heart.

1337
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,780
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1338
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,820
Keep your heart.

1339
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,100
Man, these girls are smart.

1340
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:45,740
Three stacks.

1341
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,940
These girls are smart.

1342
01:01:46,940 --> 01:02:15,900
Play your part.
