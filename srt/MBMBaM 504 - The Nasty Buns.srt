1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin. Squeaky clean hands, McElroy.

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Listen, everyone, these are dark and difficult times. They're uncertain,

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,120
you know? So I think we need to find the silver linings where we can, and there is a new,

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,440
I'm going to say historic human accomplishment this week.

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Wow.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,640
Yes, right? Let's focus on what humans can do when we believe. Are you two,

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
and I guess our audience, are you aware of Britney Spears?

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
Yeah, I've heard of her and her great music. Toxic is very good.

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,560
Toxic is very good. She makes the good music, but you know what? She also has broken a record.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:47,680
She posted on Instagram that she ran the 100 meter dash in 5.97 seconds, beating Usain Bolt,

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
apparently, by four seconds.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Well, okay, here's the one thing about that. There was nobody in her way, so that's not exactly a

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,920
good... Usain Bolt has to bob and weave around the whole... It's funny, I was excited that you

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,800
brought up Britney Spears because it is Britney bitch, and she is here to sort of rearrange our

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,360
society in a more idealistic way. She did post something about how we need wealth redistribution

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,640
right now, and that's pretty cool coming from Britney Spears and her big snake that she is going

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
to use to destroy capitalism.

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
And at this point, she is the fastest human being in recorded history, right?

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
She's so fast. Big snake.

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
She could be a modern-day Robin Hood stealing money and then running,

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,800
just like a modern day, like if you cross the flash with Robin Hood, she runs up to, I don't know,

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
is one of the Koch brothers still alive? I think he is. She takes his money bags away,

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
and then she's gone.

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,480
She's gone. Nice try. Good job trying to catch her. It's not going to happen. She has mechanoid legs.

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,280
I did not take... If you were to ask me which celeb was going to be Furiosa in this whole

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Piccadillo, I wouldn't have guessed Britney. But of course it is Britney.

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Of course it's Britney.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,320
Yeah, she is unstoppable. Unstoppable. Nothing has ever stopped her.

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, stalled. Maybe a stall.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,800
She had a hiccup. She got a hiccup in her giddy-up.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Don't we all?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
But look at her now, the fastest human being alive,

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,240
redistributing wealth with the help of her intelligent cybernetic snake. Unstoppable.

40
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,840
And I can't wait to see what record she breaks next. Maybe it'll be hot dog eating,

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,920
or perhaps world's longest nap. Because after you run, I assume-

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
You've got to lay down for a bit.

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,240
Yeah, you've got to take a nap.

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,480
Recharge.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Because if I ran the 100 meters in under six seconds, I would sleep for probably four years.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,840
Can I read the post that Britney put up on Instagram, just a little portion of it?

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
Yeah, absolutely.

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,000
It was a quote from Mimi Zhu, this whole big block of text. At one point it says,

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
technologies like virtual communication, streaming,

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
and broadcasting are part of our community collaboration.

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web.

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Whoa.

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,080
That's fucking great. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike.

54
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,680
We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay.

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:44,960
Damn.

57
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,880
If you seek Amy, I do. And here she is. And she's going to fucking put it all back together

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,200
once it all gets broken down. And it's going to get broken down a little bit.

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
And Christina, we're waiting.

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Mandy Moore, we're waiting.

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,160
Mandy Moore has always stayed out of it. That's the thing about Mandy Moore.

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,040
She's been in the game forever, but keeping it low key.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,880
And I'm like, hey, Mandy Moore, it's time to take a stand on something.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
What do you believe in, Mandy Moore?

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
Jessica Simpson has taken a lot of stands over there.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
Too many, some might say.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
But she has been willing to die on so many hills.

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
Samantha Mumba, where are you?

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Wait.

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Thank you.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Thank you.

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
Here's a story for you.

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
Britney Spears' boyfriend reveals she broke her foot while dancing.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
But this is from February 2020. Wait, what?

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,200
Wait.

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,080
Hold on a second.

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Wait.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,720
Britney broke her foot a month ago, and now she has just broken the world's record.

79
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
What an inspiration.

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
She's the Flash and Wolverine.

81
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,280
Yeah, anyway, I'm glad we have a beacon to look to.

82
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,440
I wish we could rename 2020 because fill your life with laughter and love

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,160
seems like a genuinely irresponsible motto at this point.

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
If it could just be-

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Look to Britney Spears.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
2020, look at Britney.

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,440
2020, look to Britney.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
What's that in the sky?

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
That shimmering light.

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960
There's a new North Star.

91
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
It is Britney.

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,800
What's that up in the sky?

93
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,760
It's a snake.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
It's a flight attendant.

95
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,880
No, it's Britney Spears, bitch.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
Did I say that right?

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
There was like a nanosecond too long pause, actually.

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,080
Oh, damn.

99
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
I don't think you can say it's Britney Spears, bitch.

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
It's just you lose the alliteration.

101
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,480
I don't think you can say that word at all, actually.

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Oh, man.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
Basically, yes.

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,520
Okay, can I say like snitch?

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
It's Britney.

106
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
It's Britney Spears.

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,440
She has the snitch.

108
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
She's so fast.

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,760
She got it.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
Wait, I'm seeing this right.

111
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,320
Britney doesn't have a broom.

112
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,480
She's just kicking it and running so fast that she took off like Mario.

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,400
Oh, my God.

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,760
Wow, it's Britney Spears.

115
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,440
I wish this show-

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Do you think we've missed a trick by not making the show more about Britney Spears over the years?

117
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm realizing it, yeah.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,000
I find her genuinely inspirational.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,920
We could have been tracking this whole thing.

120
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Because she says she started her first try at the 100 meters in her pose was nine,

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
which was Usain Bolt.

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,240
So she did that and was like, well, I'm as fast as Usain Bolt, but that's not enough.

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,960
That's not enough.

124
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
I want to lap this dude.

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,080
I was looking at a story, now that you brought this to my attention, I did a quick Google,

126
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,960
and they were saying how on her Twitter when she posted this revelation,

127
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,600
several of her followers just posted a comment like, huh, impressive time or great time, Britney,

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
or impressive time.

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
So nobody fucking knows anything, huh?

130
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,280
This is a good reminder that fucking nobody knows anything about what they're fucking talking about.

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,760
Right.

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Right?

133
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,200
Because like, so you do know that it's a good time.

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,320
You don't know that she just broke Usain Bolt's world record.

135
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,800
Well, they could infer that it's a good time by the fact that she posted it because it was like-

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Right, okay, yes.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,200
And it's a few number of seconds.

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
It's not a big number of seconds.

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
Yeah, it wasn't like, I did my first 100 meter day, and it's like a minute and 45 seconds.

140
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,120
But even that-

141
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
I have no idea how long 100 meters is.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,400
Yeah, frankly, if I saw that without context, I might be like, oh, cool.

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,400
Good job.

144
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
But then again, if somebody posted like, I did a mile in two and a half minutes,

145
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
I'd be like, oh, great time.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,160
A football field is 100 yards.

147
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah.

148
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,800
I think a meter's bigger than a yard.

149
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,920
A yard's a meter.

150
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,160
A yard is a meter?

151
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,160
A yard to a meter conversion is-

152
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah, it's about a meter.

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,280
So she ran a whole football field in, sorry, Travis, four seconds?

154
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Well, 5.97 seconds.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
So just a hair under six seconds.

156
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
That's quite good.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
Well, she's been training for it.

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,760
Hey, it doesn't come easy, Griffin.

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,680
She didn't roll out of bed and do this.

160
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
You know what I mean?

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
People forget this.

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,680
Yes.

163
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
They think of her as a performer.

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,400
I think it was recently discovered that Rod Stewart has been building model trains

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
while he's been onto it.

166
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,320
This is like that.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,840
She doesn't want to be known as Britney the Performer anymore.

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
That is her side hustle.

169
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,160
Her main hustle has been becoming the fastest human being in recorded history.

170
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,400
Right.

171
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
How about we do a-

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
I would like to see Britney Spears race against one of Rod Stewart's trains

173
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
for ultimate dominance.

174
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,920
My God.

175
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
But a big one.

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Do you think he's got a big, like a real life side train he gets to ride around in

177
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
and only Rod gets to ride around in?

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
This is my one for one model train.

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
We've for sure talked about Rod's trains.

180
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,320
So let's-

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,640
No, it was a touchstone.

182
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
But like, I'm wondering how Rod is sort of processing.

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
Because Rod, I'm sure like everybody else, including some of your favorite podcasters,

184
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,600
had some pretty profitable shows canceled by this unpleasantness.

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
And that's very bad for Rod.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
Rod Stewart does free him up to work on the trains pretty good, though.

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
So I'm wondering sort of where he's at on this whole thing.

188
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,120
Obviously, I'm sure Rod Stewart, not a known psychopath, sees it as a net negative.

189
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,400
There's no question about this point.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,360
After the shows were canceled, he did have to start using the trains to transport actual

191
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,800
cargo to kind of make up some of the money and the differences.

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
He spent a lot of it on glue, Justin.

193
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,720
A lot of that money went to glue.

194
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Before we hop into the news, sorry, the news.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
Oh, Jesus, no.

196
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
On our news program.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,080
God, no.

198
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,080
God, Jesus, and God, and Heaven, and Buddha, and all them.

199
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Please no.

200
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,160
No, before we hop into like questions and stuff, did want to give everybody a little

201
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
bit of good news.

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Jimmy Buffett also had some shows canceled, but he is not stopping.

203
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,240
He's doing a virtual tour, the Cabin Fever, a virtual license to chill the Spring 2020

204
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,760
tour on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,000
He's going to be streaming out a bunch of live shows for everybody to enjoy at 8 p.m.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
Eastern with an encore at 8 p.m.

207
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,880
Pacific.

208
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
You can see this at Margaritaville TV.

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
We're not being paid by Jimmy to say that.

210
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,960
I just want to give everybody a heads up.

211
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,120
If you want to take a chill little break, Saturdays, Wednesdays, 8 p.m.

212
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
You got a license to chill right there.

213
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
So heads up.

214
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
Do not call Justin at 8 p.m.

215
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,760
Eastern, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

216
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
And my stories are on.

217
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,260
Yes.

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
My co-workers and I occasionally order in food for lunch.

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,640
The other day I gave a woman $10 for lunch, but she accidentally had it delivered to her

220
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
house instead of our office.

221
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,280
Let me be clear here.

222
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,040
These are also from the before time.

223
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,360
Right.

224
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Yes.

225
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, okay.

226
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
When are we going to start getting questions from the after time, Travis?

227
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Well, we had a lot saved up, Justin, because we went on the doco and we had recorded a bunch

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,040
of episodes.

229
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,280
And I'm not going to burn good questions just because they're from a long-begotten time.

230
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,520
These are shelf-stable questions, Justin.

231
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,760
Yeah.

232
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,640
How are we to advise them?

233
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,280
Are we to advise them in the context of the now?

234
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,440
I haven't forgotten what life was like.

235
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
It's not gone from my memory, Justin.

236
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
I could dream.

237
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,400
A man can dream.

238
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
I'm like the gorilla's an instinct.

239
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,160
I think freedom is just something I dreamed.

240
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Fucking love that play.

241
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Kuba, Anthony Hopkins phoned it in.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,480
Love it.

243
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,040
Good flick.

244
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,600
Good flick.

245
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,280
So we ordered food for lunch.

246
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,360
The other day, I gave a woman $10 for lunch, but she accidentally had it delivered to her

247
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
house instead of our office.

248
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
She gave back the money and I thought we were square and that she would just eat it for

249
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,680
dinner.

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,080
On Monday, she brought my food in for me four days after it was delivered.

251
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,280
I feel bad that she's out $10, but I'm not going to eat it.

252
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
Should I pay her for this old food or are we good?

253
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,440
Huh.

254
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
That's from Alex in Mini-Snapolis.

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
P.S.

256
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,960
It was a Middle Eastern salad with chicken and hummus.

257
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay.

258
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
That ain't gonna hang.

259
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
That's that ain't a four day hang, is it?

260
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,240
No.

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,280
But what is?

262
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
But what is, I guess.

263
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
I'm not saying you need to throw.

264
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm saying that if you have not been able to witness the life cycle of this food, right?

265
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,840
And then it is brought to you.

266
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,440
There are so many points of failure along the way.

267
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,000
Exactly.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Yes, yes.

269
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,120
It was sitting on the porch at least for a while while you were at work with them.

270
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,440
And then I guess it was over the weekend and you know Susan got weird on the weekend.

271
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,280
And you're fucking your Middle Eastern salad may have been in.

272
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,040
And I apologize, but the splash zone, there's like no fucking way, dude.

273
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,520
We Susan had this food delivered to her home instead of your office.

274
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,800
We don't know a lot about Susan, but I can say one thing concretely.

275
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,080
She's a careless person.

276
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
Yes.

277
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
And I don't think I don't think this is the sort of person you trust with food hygiene.

278
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,520
Yes, correct.

279
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,880
And I would say, hey, Susan, if you're listening weird move to bring the food in on Monday.

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
That's a weird one.

281
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Susan knows that this is not news to Susan.

282
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Now, is she out $10?

283
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah.

284
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,560
Yes.

285
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,520
But that's that's good.

286
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,040
But because you need she needs to have some sort of loss.

287
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
She needs to experience loss.

288
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,200
She needs to experience a $10 grief right right now.

289
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,760
And then she will be a little bit more careful to

290
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,640
press that little button and order food to the right place.

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,040
One of two.

292
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm confused by another facet of this question.

293
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,840
OK.

294
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
The order was placed by Susan.

295
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
Maybe there's more clarity in the question that you've edited out.

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,160
But the order was placed by Susan, was it for one meal for Alex?

297
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,280
Did Alex have Susan order one discreet meal for them to enjoy?

298
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,160
Because we've added an unnecessary middle man here, a middle Susan, if you will,

299
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,840
into this process because that is an order you could definitely handle yourself.

300
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,360
The alternative is Susan was placing a bulk order.

301
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:42,160
And she showed up to her home to find a big, hot, stinky pile of Mediterranean food just on her stoop.

302
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
If you knew you were coming back to a house with a porch full of

303
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,840
really any kind of food that had been sitting in the hot sun all day,

304
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,200
like if I was Susan, I would just like five o'clock closing time.

305
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,160
Everybody's leaving.

306
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,080
They see me still at my desk working like, hey, Susan, it's closing time.

307
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,520
And then I would say like, well, no, I don't have a house anymore.

308
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,120
That house is the raccoon's house.

309
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
There's raccoons and one big bear that I guess is kind of like their dad.

310
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,280
And they all live together.

311
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,920
And the bear like helps them, bathes them, keeps them clean.

312
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,480
It's really cute.

313
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
But like I wouldn't survive in there for even a second.

314
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,800
So oh, but now I showed up after 48 hours and it seems they didn't touch your salad.

315
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
Oh, dang.

316
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
Oh, sorry, Alex.

317
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
We we've all we're all concerned about our health right now.

318
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,400
And but I don't want there's there's food safety can't go on unattended.

319
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,120
I do want to remind folks, if you're between 40 and 140 degrees,

320
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,400
that is the danger zone.

321
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,000
You do not leave food in that zone for more than four hours and then consume it.

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
And I can't I've been running a lot of different

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,400
simulations here in a program I have right on my computer.

324
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,600
And even being generous and saying this is an office where they had lunch at one

325
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,440
and then Susan got home by five, it's still been in the danger zone too long.

326
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
You got to trash it for sure.

327
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Trash it.

328
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Real quick, can we just for a moment acknowledge that there is a delivery person

329
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
that this food was ordered and they knocked and they didn't answer.

330
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,080
And they were just like, I'll leave it on the porch.

331
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah, like, whoa, that protocol, right?

332
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,040
That can't be protocol.

333
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
What else are they going to fucking do with it?

334
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
Steal it?

335
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,520
What are they going to do with it?

336
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,800
Are they going to make it snack?

337
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,320
I don't know.

338
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,760
Hey, listen, this is me.

339
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,320
This is like a living will that I'm leaving here.

340
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,920
That if you ever deliver food to me and I don't answer the door, it's yours.

341
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Or if it's me and you're delivering the food in my house and I don't answer the door,

342
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,640
you wait because I will be there at some point and I will be so hungry.

343
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,960
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,680
Few people sent this one in.

345
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Yahoo David.

346
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,720
It asks, how did the first parents know how to take care of their children?

347
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,680
Wow.

348
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,040
I mean, how do parents now know how to take care of their children?

349
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Books, internet, other parents that have been doing it.

350
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,240
Yeah, there's a lot of institutional knowledge out there, Travis.

351
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
Songs, nursery rhymes.

352
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,080
Nursery rhymes.

353
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
Daniel Tiger.

354
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,680
Old books.

355
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,920
Old books that are kind of more like what not to do.

356
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Bible is pretty much, there's a lot of stuff in Bible that is just like,

357
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,560
hey, cautionary tale, don't do this one with baby.

358
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,720
I bet there was a lot of angels showing up that first time around.

359
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
God was like, you're on your own.

360
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
And then how many have had babies?

361
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
And God was like, oh shit, okay, wait.

362
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,880
Do you go down there and tell them not to give them marbles or whatever?

363
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Right.

364
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,800
There were a few babies before.

365
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
God was just like, nope, they'll get it.

366
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,880
They'll get it.

367
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,120
They'll get it.

368
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,600
Just calm down.

369
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
They're going to get it.

370
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
All right, they're not going to get it.

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Get down there.

372
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,320
Get down there.

373
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Okay, Gabriel, just real quick.

374
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
Do go down there and tell them to cook that food.

375
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
Oh, please.

376
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,600
Do you think that the first people, let's call them Adam and Eve.

377
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,800
Do you think that the first people who are the first parents,

378
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,120
do you think that they maybe started to pretend they got it less than they did

379
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
just so they could go on dates and shit?

380
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,760
Like, oh, yeah, I'd love to watch the kids tonight, Gabriel.

381
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
Damn, let me just put them into the stove.

382
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,640
No, okay, you're right.

383
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,040
Damn it.

384
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Okay, so we'll be at TGI Fridays.

385
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
Here's the hospital's number.

386
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
I mean, it would be tough, right?

387
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Because it would be like, God has given us this great baby and we love him so much,

388
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,520
but God has also given us a tree stump with a perfectly baby-sized hole in it.

389
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,640
So I think that that is like the storage unit.

390
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160
I think that it didn't come with baby.

391
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,960
But I think, I mean, look at, look, perfect fit, like a perfect satisfying fit.

392
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
So like, if God didn't want us to jam our baby in this log

393
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,520
and go out to, you know, the cheesecake factory, then why is the hole that way?

394
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,800
Good point.

395
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,640
Do you guys think that there was some point where the first people,

396
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
the first parents were like, you think this thing eats?

397
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
I think that that is true.

398
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm more concerned about just baby just like poops on itself and the ground or whatever.

399
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,760
And then the parents are like, hey, I know he's like little and stuff,

400
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
but this baby is not cleaning his butt the way we all clean our butt.

401
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
And it's pretty fucked up if you ask me.

402
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
It's gross, right?

403
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
It's gnarly, right?

404
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,040
We can all agree that, should we talk to him?

405
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Like when I do it, I go outside and we don't have TP yet,

406
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,360
but you know, I'll use a big leaf and this baby doesn't even go outside.

407
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
He doesn't know how to use the clamshells?

408
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,560
Nope.

409
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
I use the clamshells.

410
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,720
We have these three shells that I use to clean my butt and he doesn't use it right.

411
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah, he doesn't use mammoth bidet, wear a blaster butt with his big gnarly trunk.

412
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
I mean, it's a living.

413
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
It's a living, but like what?

414
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,200
I think it's kind of rude and I would actually like to ask him to leave.

415
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,360
Can you go ask Fred Flintstone what he did to get his kid to use their bidet?

416
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,400
I mean, Fred Flintstone's kid beats the shit out of him.

417
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,920
Oh wait, that's Barney's kid.

418
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
No, that's Barney's kid.

419
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,720
Beats the shit out of him all the time.

420
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,920
Man, that's rough.

421
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,680
Fred's kid's got a cereal deal.

422
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,480
She can't be seen doing that kind of thing.

423
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,360
Here is another question for you, my brothers.

424
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm pretty sure my neighbor sells weed and I really want some.

425
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
Okay, all right.

426
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,480
Okay.

427
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
I've only ever smoked with friends who had their own weed,

428
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,440
but I'm an adult now and I have to get it for myself.

429
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,560
I know very little about him since he's a few years younger than me

430
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
and we didn't talk when we were in high school.

431
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,400
I don't have his phone number and we're not friends on social media.

432
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
How do I find out if he actually has the good kush for sale?

433
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,520
Please help me.

434
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
I really want to blaze it, but I don't know how to get weed.

435
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
That's from wannabe loner stoner.

436
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
And boy, have you ever come to the right place.

437
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,680
I think it's important that we do a question like this every year or so, annually or so,

438
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,880
just to remind people that we don't fucking know.

439
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
We don't know.

440
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,480
It would be, hey, everyone alive?

441
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,760
It would be pretty fucking cool if I knew at this junction, it would be pretty cool.

442
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll take it one step further and clarify for those listening.

443
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
Not only do I not know where to get weed,

444
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,200
I don't know how to ask somebody where to get weed.

445
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,040
So I am now in a position where it's like,

446
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,920
I don't know where to get it and I'm too afraid to ask

447
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,120
because I'm pretty sure if I walked out to another human being and said,

448
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,480
from whom might I purchase marijuana?

449
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
They would be like, oh, you're a cop.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
Can you not, Travis, can you not buy it?

451
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
Well, I mean, listen.

452
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
But hey, you want to cut through the bullshit, Justin?

453
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
Yes, I can buy that medical shit and I do.

454
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
But I'm saying that's not cool.

455
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
That's not a cool feeling, right?

456
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
I think it's pretty cool.

457
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
I think it's pretty fucking neat.

458
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
I like how you can't be arrested and it's not weird.

459
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,320
No, that is cool.

460
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
Listen, that's cool.

461
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,560
But I never had-

462
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
You could be arrested because the federal statutes have changed.

463
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
I know, yeah, it's fucked up.

464
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll explain it.

465
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,120
It's the whole thing.

466
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,920
Listen, if they weren't paying attention before,

467
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,560
they sure as fuck are paying attention now, okay?

468
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,160
So go ahead and just go nuts.

469
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,840
As long as your weed dealer isn't selling to nine other people at the same time,

470
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
I don't think they can touch you.

471
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
Maybe there's one of those scenarios where you can just say like,

472
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
hey, do you sell weed?

473
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,920
Because I bet if they do, they're happy for the customers, right?

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,040
Like, if you're someone who sells weed, you like selling marijuana to people, right?

475
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,600
You think that's-

476
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
You're probably looking for new customers, right?

477
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,880
Right?

478
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,440
You can't-

479
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
No, here's the problem, right?

480
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
No, this is incorrect.

481
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,440
You're actually wrong.

482
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
Because if they're-

483
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,960
I thought I was onto something.

484
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,840
No, you're wrong.

485
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,920
Because if you're wrong, then you're going to put them into a position where they're like,

486
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,840
what am I putting out there in my day to day

487
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,800
where it makes it seem like I'm a person who's selling weed?

488
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,320
And that's not a bad or a good thing.

489
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
But it is like, that's not my identity, I don't think.

490
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Like, I don't know that that's my vibe.

491
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,320
It's a weird vibe to put out in the world if I'm not.

492
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,440
Should I?

493
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,040
Like, should I?

494
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,720
Am I missing an opportunity?

495
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
Well, but here's the thing.

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
In this day and age, everybody's selling something, Justin.

497
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,920
So maybe it's not weed, but you're like, hey, do you sell weed?

498
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,920
And they're like, no, but I do make handmade hacky sacks or whatever.

499
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,720
And I'll sell it to you.

500
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,160
And you're like, oh, okay.

501
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,080
So now I need to find somebody who's looking for hacky sacks to trade for weed.

502
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,160
But then you find somebody who's trading hacky sacks for crochet patterns or whatever.

503
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,080
And eventually you will find somebody who will take your,

504
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't know, your antique waffles for weed.

505
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Antique waffles is gross, Trav.

506
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,960
Well, I meant like from an antique waffle maker.

507
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
I didn't mean like they were super old waffles.

508
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,240
You were just, I feel like you're also risking falling pretty deep into a multi-level marketing

509
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,800
thing.

510
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,240
Like, do you sell weed?

511
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,800
No, but I got some fucking choice lula roe.

512
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm so glad you asked.

513
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,800
Let me open my sample case that I always have.

514
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
And you thought was full of weed.

515
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,440
But actually it's lula roe.

516
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,640
Here's the thing I would warn you about, Question Asker.

517
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,280
You don't have any connection to this person.

518
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,440
Doesn't sound like you had any interest in being their friend.

519
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,680
Even though it sounds like they live next to you.

520
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,600
And so I think maybe get to know them.

521
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:41,760
Or if you don't want to do that, don't open up the relationship with one of bartering quality.

522
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,920
Because I think that would put some strain, no pun intended, on the neighborly relationship.

523
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,560
I guess.

524
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,480
Of course you should hold off on sort of bridge building for a little bit.

525
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
Just want to get that out there.

526
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,080
You could set up though like maybe a pulley rope system between houses.

527
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
Would they send over a little weed?

528
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
So the coronavirus little amoebas can fucking Mission Impossible

529
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,840
zip line from one house to the other.

530
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,320
Oh no, Jeremy fell.

531
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,800
It's okay.

532
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
There's a billion of us.

533
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,360
Go, go, go.

534
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,680
Fuck.

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,320
I forgot.

536
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
You're right, Griffin.

537
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
I forgot because I had watched Osmosis Jones the other day and that is how that works.

538
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Listen, just get a trench coat, turn on the in your eyes,

539
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
and stand outside their window with your bong above your head.

540
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,440
In my lungs.

541
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,680
I need some weed in my lungs.

542
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Yes, indeed, in my lungs.

543
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
I hate to interrupt our program.

544
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,920
We do have to take a brief sojourn to the Money Zone,

545
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,600
if you guys would be so kind as to join me.

546
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,320
Okay.

547
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Here, hop on my back.

548
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
Travis, you hop on my back.

549
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,680
Griffin, you hop on Travis's back.

550
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,560
Okay, here I come.

551
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,400
Oops, I jumped all the way over the two of you.

552
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,080
And I cleared you by like three or four feet.

553
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,040
Let me try again.

554
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,840
Well, I did it.

555
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
Oh wow, even higher that time.

556
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,840
Wow.

557
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
Damn powerful jumping.

558
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
These damn powerful legs of mine.

559
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,280
If Brittany had my height with her speed, she could upper cut the sun.

560
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,720
She actually just got a call to hear about how high you're jumping,

561
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
and she's like, I can beat it.

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,600
Hey, I know we're trying to go to the Money Zone,

563
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
but Trav, hop off there.

564
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,360
You're going to hurt yourself.

565
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,680
Okay.

566
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,120
I know we're trying to go to the Money Zone real quick,

567
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
but Travis mentioned Osmosis Jones.

568
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
That brought something to my mind.

569
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,560
There are movies trending right now like Contagion and Outbreak and the like.

570
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,640
I always see it like in my trending shit on streaming platforms or whatever.

571
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,360
And I don't know why a person would watch one of those at this moment,

572
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,920
but how is Osmosis Jones not crept in?

573
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,600
Like how is this not the moment we need Osmosis Jones and his funny uptight pill friend

574
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,800
to like come in and kind of provide maybe even a little bit of a how to,

575
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
like a funny joke and animation and loving that,

576
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,520
but like also maybe there's something you can take away there

577
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,480
that would be helpful at this junction in that movie.

578
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,400
I mean, does a white blood cell and one cold pill be, is it SARS?

579
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,520
It's something like that, right?

580
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
It's something pretty bad, yeah.

581
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,120
I bet Griffin, David Hyde Pierce has begun every morning

582
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,560
just firing up that trending and being like, let's see, is it?

583
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,760
Oh, no.

584
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,040
Oh, all right.

585
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,400
Not right this second.

586
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,880
All right.

587
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,120
So now?

588
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
Yeah, Travis, get back up there.

589
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,200
And then I'm going to get, I didn't jump high enough in that time.

590
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,240
Oh, ow.

591
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
You're laying around my back.

592
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,320
Let me try again.

593
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,400
I'll tell you what, I'm going to go get a stepladder.

594
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,440
You guys start without me.

595
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
Honey, where's the stepladder?

596
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,880
Oh, no.

597
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
That's in the, oh, man.

598
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,920
Did we?

599
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,440
What a vibrant palette.

600
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:03,840
Oh, shoot.

601
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,920
Here in my neck of the woods, like a lot of places, I think,

602
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,520
dine-in restaurants aren't keeping it going right now.

603
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
Can't kind of do that dining in thing.

604
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,640
So it has been a actual, genuine, huge relief to have DoorDash

605
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
available in our neighborhood.

606
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,720
And what I have really appreciated is it gives us a way to support

607
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,160
local restaurants here using DoorDash.

608
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
It couldn't be easier.

609
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,240
You open up the app, you find what you want to eat, and it's brought to you,

610
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,320
in my experience, always in a speedy, efficient manner.

611
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
And they got a lot of, it's not just like the big chains.

612
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
They got a lot of local restaurants on there, too.

613
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,600
So you can keep kicking them some money at a time when they really need it.

614
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
And you get delicious food.

615
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,960
It's really, it's a win-win.

616
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,280
And all the drivers have been, that cannot be an easy gig right now.

617
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
They got to be busy, busy.

618
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
And they have been so kind and always a smile.

619
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,280
And it's been a wonderful experience to have.

620
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,320
So right now, our listeners can get $5 off their first order of $15 or more

621
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,000
when you download the DoorDash app and enter code DOREDASH.

622
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,120
Enter code BROTHER.

623
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,800
That's $5 off your first order when you download the DoorDash app in the app store

624
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,640
and enter code BROTHER.

625
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Get me undies.

626
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Go get them.

627
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
Acquire them now.

628
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
You don't have to leave the house to get them, which is good.

629
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,720
You shouldn't be leaving the house.

630
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,160
And if you're going to be kicking it around the house, you may as well be doing it.

631
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,200
And the most fucking comfortable garments available that are made from the micromodal fabric,

632
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,400
which is a, just, it is a, listen, they use science and synth weave technology

633
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,880
to compile these powerful underpants.

634
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,040
And they got a variety of ranges from extra small to 4XL.

635
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,600
I wear them every day and they keep me safe and dry down there and comfortable down there.

636
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,120
Ooh!

637
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Yeah, it's like my pee-pee's at the spa.

640

That's meundies.com slash my brother.

641
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,520
You know what I've been doing, fellas, that's really helped keep my spirits up,

642
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,960
is I've been getting dressed every day, even though I work from home and I could keep my PJs on.

643
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,600
I put on some new clothes and let's be honest, a lot of those clothes are coming from Stitch Fix

644
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,520
and it makes me feel like I still have, you know, purpose and things to do.

645
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,960
And then I'm capable of doing that.

646
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,400
I hadn't thought about what a hard adjustment this must be for you, Travis.

647
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm sure you miss your crew at the office something fierce.

648
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,120
Well, it's just that, you know, Dwight's always making jokes and, you know, Jim's so serious.

649
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
He doesn't think anything's funny.

650
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
You know, it's just, I miss them.

651
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,200
Are you still in love with Pam?

652
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,160
Oh yeah, but I don't know how to tell her.

653
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,680
Uh oh.

654
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,800
Travis is Roy.

655
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,520
Travis has casted himself as Roy in the office, I think.

656
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,840
But in my version, I'm the hero.

657
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,320
I'm the blue collar worker who everyone respects because of my heart of gold.

658
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,560
And Jim's a real bully.

659
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
And he fucking is.

660
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,560
He is in the real, well, you can't unpack this right now.

661
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,520
Yeah, we can talk about this later, but he, why is he so mean to Dwight?

662
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
Okay, not all close.

663
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,600
Now I'm just going to start at the beginning.

664
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,680
So Stitch Fix is a styling service where their personal stylist will ask you questions like,

665
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,160
do you like this?

666
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,960
Do you like this?

667
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,760
Does this fit your style?

668
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,720
What do you think about this?

669
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,200
And as you answer those questions, it is going to hone in your style so that it perfectly

670
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,920
matches you.

671
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,280
Then they send you a box with five items in it.

672
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
You try them on.

673
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,960
You say, I like this.

674
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,760
I don't like this.

675
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
Oh, can I get this in a different size?

676
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,640
And you can return whatever you don't want and you don't pay for what you return and

677
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,840

Hi, I'm Dave Hill from before.

692
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,000
And I'm very excited to bring Dave Hill's podcasting incident back to Maximum Fun where

693
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
it belongs.

694
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,520
You can get brand new episodes every Friday on maximumfun.org or, you know, wherever.

695
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,560
And while my partner Chris Gersbeck and I might lack in specific subject matter on our

696
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,840
podcast, we make up for in special effects.

697
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Chris, add something cool right here.

698
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,040
Also, we have explosions, animal noises and sometimes even this.

699
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,920
Dave Hill's podcasting incident every Friday on Maximum Fun.

700
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,760
Chris, do another explosion right here.

701
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,840
Real quick, I just wanted to clarify.

702
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,560
Sorry, guys.

703
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,000
It was anthrax that Osmosis Jones and-

704
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,680
Was it really now?

705
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,560
Was it really?

706
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,840
Anthrax, it's Laurence Fishburne voices Thrax.

707
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,600
Okay, but we know what that means.

708
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:33,600
According to the Wikipedia, a tall, extremely virulent pathogenetic agent and just also

709
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,160
real quick side note, Kid Rock makes a cameo in Osmosis Jones as Kidney Rock.

710
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,640
Oh, I thought you were going to say-

711
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,920
Wow, that's good.

712
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,160
As a nasty little amoeba man, because that's sort of how he presents himself in real life.

713
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,800
And I'm not fucking afraid to say it, that I think Kid Rock is a nasty man.

714
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,040
Yep.

715
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Maybe before all this shit broke bad, the before times Griffin would keep his mouth

716
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,400
shut because he knows how many people out there love and respect Kid Rock, but I think

717
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,200
that now-

718
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,160
He could be listening.

719
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,920
He could be listening, but now I've been emboldened by this tough time.

720
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,520
I've been sharpened and honed like a katana or something, and I'll just say that Kid Rock

721
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,760
sucks shit, and he's a nasty man.

722
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
Yep, there it is.

723
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
Come on, come on.

724
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,880
I have a Yahoo here, and it's part of a beautiful trend of Yahoos that I've been noticing since

725
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,000
people have been sending it in.

726
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,160
A lot of people sent this one in as well, and it is Yahoos that have been sent in during

727
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,120
the during times.

728
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay. This one is from March 20th, so I think we can safely consider that the during times.

729
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:54,000
And it's Dylan, and Dylan asks, my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns.

730
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,280
So everybody is suffering from this in their own way, some much, much worse and much more

731
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,600
serious than others, and we would encourage you to find ways to support the people out

732
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,560
there who really need your help.

733
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,400
But the good news is that none of those people are on Yahoo Answers, because Dylan says,

734
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,640
my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns.

735
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,320
I hate when he does this.

736
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,120
I hate when he does this.

737
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,720
When he grills hamburgers, there's a specific type of buns I like him to buy.

738
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,600
They are small, light buns.

739
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes, yes.

740
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,840
I like light buns and I cannot lie.

741
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,320
I like the way he's put in commas here, because it says, they are small, light, buns.

742
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,480
These buns are buns.

743
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,680
Since the burgers are never too big, they get smaller when you cook them.

744
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
That's just burger physiology.

745
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,840
He bought the freaking big dark buns.

746
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,320
The bun is bigger than the entire patty, which means when I bite, I will be biting into the

747
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,600
bun and it's dark, which I don't like the dark buns he buys.

748
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,320
What should I do?

749
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
Oh, man.

750
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,560
I mean, I hate to see that.

751
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,200
I think it's important to be, you know, not necessarily conservative, but like thoughtful

752
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,480
about the food that you have and the food that is able to be circulated among the community.

753
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,120
But at the same time, biting into a big burger and getting worse.

754
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,240
And where's the beef?

755
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Like, oh, man, is there anything fucking worse than that?

756
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,040
My heart goes out to this person's father.

757
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,720
The supplies or the selection is pretty slim.

758
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,000
I went to the grocery store recently and brought home whole wheat tortillas.

759
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,880
And you would have thought that I had vivisected a baby deer in front of my family because

760
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,560
they were met with such disdain and utter disgust.

761
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,640
These whole wheat tortillas that no one wanted and sit untouched.

762
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,600
I brought home a big pack of Uncle Ben's dirty rice, an instant pack.

763
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,400
And Rachel was like, what the fuck?

764
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,160
I was like, yeah, man, maybe we're a dirty rice family now.

765
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,360
Maybe we're going to have a season of jambalaya.

766
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,440
And that is how we will look back on this.

767
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
But the big buns, guys, is there anything we can do?

768
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,800
Obviously, we can get we can cut the buns, but then the edges are bigger.

769
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,200
I mean, that compromises the integrity.

770
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,680
The daddy can't make bigger meat.

771
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,360
The daddy knows how to make one type of burger.

772
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,960
It's like you can't you can't you can't unprogram that.

773
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,560
And you know what?

774
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
Me like a slider.

775
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,760
Travy like a slider.

776
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,120
Travy like a slider.

777
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,560
Make me feel like big man.

778
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,320
When Travis first went to Applebee's and they were like, hey, man, we got sliders.

779
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,280
And he's like, what's sliders?

780
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,680
The show.

781
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,120
I love that Jerry O'Connell kick ass.

782
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,360
And they were like, no, no, no.

783
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,680
It's like three burgers that you eat instead of one.

784
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,560
And then Travis was like, but that's my whole life now.

785
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Three burgers instead of one burger?

786
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
OK, where do I sign up?

787
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,080
Is there some sort of license I need some sort of registry I join?

788
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,920
No, but if there is some kind of slider agency, I would love that.

789
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
Did you say Bigger Burger already?

790
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,720
Did I miss Bigger Burger?

791
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
We talked about Bigger Burger.

792
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
Yeah, I just want to make sure I got in with Bigger Burger.

793
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
But we talked about Bigger.

794
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,200
We said.

795
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Yeah, but I don't want people to wonder if I thought Bigger Burger was a good idea

796
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,080
because I hadn't agreed, you know, vociferously that like Bigger Burger is a great play.

797
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,000
OK, because at least I did the whole me like a slider thing.

798
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,880
Bigger, but the slider is a smaller burger.

799
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,120
So I think that's what I'm saying is I don't know.

800
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,320
But I don't want a big.

801
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,200
No, Justin, sorry.

802
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,120
Can you step over here, please?

803
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,440
You guys go do that.

804
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,400
Can I close the door if this is going to be bad?

805
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,960
You close the door.

806
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,200
I'll keep doing the podcast while you guys sort of talk it out.

807
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
Let me look at the camera real quick so they know that it's like, oh, boy, here we go.

808
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,360
Justin, what I'm saying is I don't want a Bigger Burger

809
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,240
because I like a smaller burger.

810
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,280
I was specifically.

811
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,800
I was specifically saying that making a Bigger Burger would be angry because I like a slider.

812
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,440
Do you understand?

813
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,000
Do you get it?

814
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,520
Do you fucking get it?

815
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,000
No, I get it.

816
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
It's just not helpful.

817
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
You're not helping.

818
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,520
No, but I was going down an avenue, Justin.

819
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,000
I was looking.

820
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,720
I'll clean out my desk.

821
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,440
I'll clean out my desk.

822
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,760
Thank you.

823
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,400
I'll clean up my desk.

824
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,280
I'm tired of doing this.

825
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,720
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

826
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
You could eat the.

827
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,200
You could eat the.

828
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,040
You could squish the fine.

829
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,160
How did you get in here, Griffin?

830
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
The powerful ball.

831
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,920
I closed the door.

832
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
You heard me virtually close the door.

833
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Why are we creating so many audio escapes in this episode?

834
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,000
It seems like we're leaning on audio escapes more than normal.

835
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,800
Okay, speaking of nasty hamburger bites.

836
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,520
I want a munch.

837
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,020
Squad.

838
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,080
I want to munch.

839
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,580
Squad.

840
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:08,180
My feeds are filled currently, not with menu innovations,

841
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,020
which is a cornerstone of the Munch Squad,

842
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,020
but just a lot of restaurants that are trying to do something.

843
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,820
I mean, a lot of these.

844
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,180
Can we live stream a taco?

845
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,860
Is that anything?

846
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,820
Bud, you're not that far off.

847
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,500
Actually, Travis, you must be reading ahead.

848
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,860
Rob Grogowski is going to join Chipotle for Thursday's virtual hangout.

849
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,020
So everybody's kind of wondering what they can do, right?

850
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,420
And there's a lot of brands that are just like,

851
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,980
how do we Bojangles step in and try to do something about this?

852
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,860
What is Bojangles' role in all of this?

853
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,100
And I can safely do that because they closed the Bojangles in Huntington

854
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,460
so nobody can get me.

855
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,100
You can't do anything to hurt me, Bojangles.

856
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,900
We will learn to.

857
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,380
I'm invincible.

858
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,900
We will learn to eat Bojangles and hold each other through the waves of the web.

859
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,660
Rob Grogowski is going to join Chipotle for Thursday's virtual hangout.

860
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,420
While people face ongoing challenges of spending time apart,

861
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,300
Chipotle wants to connect with its fans and deliver some much needed positive vibes.

862
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,740
Chipotle is teaming up with famous brand super fans to host Chipotle Together.

863
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,380
Yes, they're both in caps.

864
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,980
Chipotle Together, a series of virtual hangouts for fans

865
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,020
that feature celebrity appearances, exclusive content and free entree giveaways.

866
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,980
Folks, before I go too much deeper, I want to say,

867
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,340
if someone says, what are you doing today?

868
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,380
And you say, well, I'm going to hang out with Chipotle and Rob Grogowski virtually,

869
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,460
that is very much a second month of quarantine answer.

870
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,220
Like we will accept that and say,

871
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,060
I think Chipotle thinks people are a lot more desperate right now

872
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,500
than they are, baby.

873
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,100
It's been like a week and a half.

874
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,540
We're hanging in there.

875
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,940
Like this is for spitball and new hobbies, right?

876
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,180
Like you've just taken up knitting or painting.

877
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,380
But by April, the knitting stuff's in the fucking garbage

878
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,100
and you're fucking burritoing out with Gronk.

879
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,740
Yes.

880
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,940
Now, here's what I will say.

881
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,300
If the pinch was we have overstuffed this burrito

882
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,660
and you're going to watch Rob Grogowski try to navigate it.

883
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,380
Yeah, that's maybe a third week.

884
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,060
That might be a third week of the quarantine thing.

885
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,900
Yeah, I feel like they've jumped the gun a little bit.

886
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,380
Thursday's Chipotle Together, it's scheduled for 2 p.m.

887
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,460
So you missed this one, but I'm sure there's going to be another.

888
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,020
It's going to feature football legend, Rob Gronk Gronkowski

889
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,260
and wrestler Mojo, who will host a 30 minute at home workout

890
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,420
for fans on his Instagram, participate in a Q&A

891
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,620
and give away 5,000 free burritos.

892
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,740
Now, I'm going to assume it is a coupon

893
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,820
and not some sort of elaborate,

894
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,140
maybe drone based burrito delivery.

895
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,500
Or pneumatic tubes.

896
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,780
Or orbital cannon.

897
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,580
Ow!

898
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,540
Gronkowski has the nuclear football, which he loves.

899
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,540
And he will use the orbital cannon to blast big, big burritos

900
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,580
right down your chimney like a Santa Claus would.

901
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,460
Chipotle has rolled out a series of innovations

902
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,100
to elevate the delivery experience for its fans,

903
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,260
which is a wild way of saying this.

904
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,380
So they've got delivery kitchens,

905
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,460
which featured dedicated teams and ingredient stations

906
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,380
to prepare digital orders with care.

907
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,100
Good.

908
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,900
The second thing it says is new tamper evident packaging seals

909
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,020
to help ensure food is untouched during delivery.

910
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,220
Can we stop for a second?

911
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,660
Can we stop for a second?

912
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,420
Has this been...

913
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,380
Hey Chipotle, can we talk over here?

914
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,660
Has this been an ongoing concern

915
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,900
that you're just now alerting me to?

916
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,540
Have you been aware of a problem with food being untouched

917
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,180
during delivery?

918
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,380
You should have shared this information with the rest of us.

919
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,260
Yes, right.

920
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,740
Just so we're clear,

921
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,260
I'm not loving that during the coronavirus pandemic.

922
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,500
I'm also similarly not loving it before and or after.

923
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,260
I really, if you had the one knowledge of this problem

924
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,260
and two ability to stop it,

925
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,940
it's morally delinquent

926
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,140
that you have done nothing about it to this point.

927
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,540
We have finally begun encouraging our employees

928
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,100
to stop slapping the sour cream when they open it

929
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,540
to test the surface tension.

930
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,460
What?

931
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,180
That's the thing,

932
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,060
unless you can offer me a tamper proof thing

933
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,420
that lets me know it wasn't touched

934
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,260
while it was being made either,

935
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,420
I think there is still an opportunity

936
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,780
for contamination there.

937
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,660
Because my concern wasn't that the person driving it

938
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,220
would be like,

939
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,380
I wanna see what they got on their burrito.

940
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,140
Yeah, let me pop this open real quick

941
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,820
and get a real quick touch going.

942
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,500
I just wanna take stock of whether they got

943
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,180
the pico de gallo or not.

944
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,580
No, I don't think that's the concern.

945
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,020
I want a tamper evident burrito

946
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,060
where if you open it,

947
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,980
it just fucking explodes and showers you

948
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,820
in refried beans like a bait bag at a bank

949
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,620
or something like that.

950
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,820
This is our bait car,

951
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,940
but it's a burrito.

952
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,980
And if you even touch it,

953
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,940
the cops will swarm.

954
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,260
How about another question?

955
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,300
How would that treat everybody?

956
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,180
Yeah, that sounds good.

957
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,100
Good, good, good.

958
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,940
A duck has recently set up shop

959
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,060
and laid eggs in the bush

960
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,060
directly outside the only door to my apartment.

961
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,380
Nice.

962
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,380
The problem is every time I come home,

963
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,900
the duck flaps away panicked

964
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,820
and stands in the parking lot staring at me

965
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,260
until I go inside.

966
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,620
Aside from the near heart attack

967
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,300
this caused me the first few times,

968
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,700
I feel bad for repeatedly alarming this duck

969
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,940
and interrupting her egg sitting routine.

970
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,180
How do I convince this duck that we're chill

971
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,100
and I want nothing but the best

972
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,940
for her and her future ducklings?

973
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,180
That's from Duck Disruptor in Tennessee,

974
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,620
a very considerate human being.

975
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,780
How do you know for the duck?

976
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,780
Damn, I wish we could talk to ducks.

977
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,180
Damn it.

978
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,500
Right?

979
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,300
Think of all the things we'd learn.

980
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,460
Think of all the things we could teach them.

981
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:57,940
Damn it.

982
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,820
Our two societies,

983
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,340
the duck and the human

984
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,580
would improve by leaps and bounds

985
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,500
if only we could break

986
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,660
this damn communication barrier.

987
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,180
I see a bunch of ducks hanging out at the park.

988
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,140
I want to tell them like,

989
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,260
guys, no, go home.

990
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,660
You need to fucking chill right now, ducks.

991
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,940
But they don't listen to me.

992
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,940
I bet there's a lot of ducks out there

993
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,740
that are like,

994
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,340
man, I miss bread.

995
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,900
Yeah.

996
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,340
You guys remember?

997
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,700
We didn't appreciate it

998
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,660
when they would throw

999
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,340
dumb goldfish crackers at us.

1000
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,780
I loved that.

1001
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,700
I should have told them when I had the chance

1002
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,860
and I could speak English this whole time.

1003
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,980
And I should have told them.

1004
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,980
What if the only word they know is quack?

1005
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,220
We just haven't taught them other words, right?

1006
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,180
Because they say quack.

1007
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:40,580
Whoa.

1008
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,420
And that's like a word in English, right?

1009
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:42,740
Quack.

1010
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
Well, there's a one duck that says Aflac.

1011
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,580
He is a goose,

1012
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,940
but they're the same animal as we've-

1013
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,740
No, he's a duck.

1014
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:49,940
Is he?

1015
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:50,820
Yeah.

1016
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,540
Yeah, he's a duck, isn't he?

1017
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,500
Yeah, read a book.

1018
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,460
Well-

1019
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,100
No way of knowing.

1020
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,980
Geese and duck.

1021
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,260
Justin, are you with me on this?

1022
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,580
They are the same animal.

1023
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,380
They're the same.

1024
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,660
One's a stretched out duck.

1025
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,020
If someone's taller,

1026
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,620
Benedict Cumberbatch is taller than me,

1027
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,900
I don't say there goes a human too.

1028
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,540
You know what I mean?

1029
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,140
Just because his body's a different shell.

1030
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,860
That's fucked up.

1031
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,980
There's no proof that he's human.

1032
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,100
But there is, what I'm saying, Griffin,

1033
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,260
is that you could maybe convince me

1034
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,500
Swan is big duck,

1035
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,900
but goose is not big duck.

1036
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,980
We can't relitigate this, Travis.

1037
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,660
I'm just saying Swan is like attractive big duck.

1038
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,860
It's the bridge.

1039
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,620
A goose is a whole other thing.

1040
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,580
It's the genetic bridge between these two incredible birds

1041
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,900
that no matter what, we can't talk to either of them.

1042
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,740
So there's no point arguing this.

1043
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,020
But what if we could find,

1044
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,780
we can talk to parrot, right?

1045
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,180
So if we find a parrot that can speak duck,

1046
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,180
that could be the in-between.

1047
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,740
Here we go.

1048
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,780
Here we go.

1049
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,820
Wait a minute.

1050
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,020
Travis, that's a big idea that we need to just

1051
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,380
slow down for a second.

1052
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,100
Slow down for a second.

1053
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,100
What Travis is suggesting is

1054
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,580
parrots speak a human.

1055
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,980
Parrots speak a bird.

1056
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,220
Is this the missing link that we've been needing?

1057
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,580
We just haven't asked.

1058
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,340
It's a really good point, actually.

1059
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,500
So I go to the park with my pet parrot

1060
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,700
and I say, parrot, you gotta warn these ducks.

1061
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,020
And then I hear the parrot, you know,

1062
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,780
make incredible bird noises

1063
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,420
that my stupid human ears can't even understand.

1064
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,580
And then I just kind of see one of the ducks eyebrows go up

1065
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,740
like, oh, oh, oh, and they scoot on home.

1066
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,300
Thanks for warning.

1067
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,380
They tell their friends all ducks are now

1068
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,620
like just fucking safe and in lockdown.

1069
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,780
Who's this parrot?

1070
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,540
Who is this Seabiscuit parrot?

1071
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,820
Is it just all parrots?

1072
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,060
Do we need to start like a network?

1073
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,980
Well, no, because I wouldn't, one,

1074
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,340
not all parents speak duck,

1075
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,500
but also like, do you trust?

1076
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,020
Like that's saying like,

1077
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,020
I would let anyone translate from me

1078
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,220
and like an important negotiation between two countries, right?

1079
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,260
We're gonna need to find

1080
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,660
like an even-tempered trustworthy parrot

1081
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,140
where like, I know that this parrot

1082
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,380
isn't taking liberties in the translation

1083
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,700
and isn't like, he told me to tell you he's cool,

1084
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,140
but he's a real turd.

1085
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,100
Yeah.

1086
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,380
You know?

1087
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,700
Yeah.

1088
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,220
How do you trust a parrot?

1089
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,740
There is no good answer for that,

1090
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,100
except for you don't, you can't.

1091
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,660
Well, you would have to find a duck who spoke human

1092
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,900
that the parrot didn't know that the duck spoke human

1093
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,060
that you could be like, all right, duck, what did he say?

1094
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,620
I mean, I've never asked a duck to honk into my phone

1095
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,020
using Google Translate.

1096
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,820
Oh, shit.

1097
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,180
Like I haven't tried it.

1098
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
And it probably, I'll be the first to say,

1099
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,140
99% chance it doesn't work.

1100
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,380
But if there's a 1% chance I can get out there

1101
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,940
But there's always that one chance.

1102
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,900
and just sort of ring the the the clacks on

1103
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,500
for these incredible animals,

1104
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,860
I'm going to, I am gonna risk it.

1105
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,180
Now, Griffin, if a scientist came to you and said,

1106
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,420
we figured it out, but we only have enough power

1107
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,820
to generate one message to the ducks.

1108
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,140
Get out, get out of there.

1109
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,540
Okay, but in what context?

1110
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,420
Get out of the bush?

1111
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,420
I mean, it's like, get out of there, wherever they're at.

1112
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:06,740
Yeah.

1113
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,860
Well, then where do they go?

1114
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,940
Are you just saying get off the planet, ducks?

1115
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,580
Okay, fine.

1116
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,860
Come to my house, ducks.

1117
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,820
You'll be safe here.

1118
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,260
But I don't feel like that is gonna like,

1119
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,740
you need to say like, trust me because, now come to my house.

1120
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,940
Trust me because I have some breath.

1121
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,100
Not a lot, but all ducks,

1122
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,340
please report to Griffin McElroy's house.

1123
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,060
This is mandatory.

1124
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,620
Or you know, let me finish.

1125
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,620
Okay, thank you.

1126
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,140
Dear all ducks, please report to Griffin McElroy's house,

1127
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,020
address here, and immediately.

1128
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,300
And I'm not even worried about like,

1129
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,180
putting that address out there

1130
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,660
because this will be in duck language.

1131
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,420
So like, human beings won't even understand it.

1132
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,100
And come to my house.

1133
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,820
I do have bread.

1134
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,860
This is mandatory.

1135
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,940
If you do not come to my house immediately,

1136
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,620
you will be punished with duck punishment.

1137
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,820
Ooh, that's the worst time.

1138
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,980
The ducks, and you're saying now,

1139
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,860
and this is a long message,

1140
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,060
but you didn't say how long it could be,

1141
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,820
but I haven't put a period in yet.

1142
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,900
And you may be wondering how Griffin knows

1143
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,100
what duck punishment is.

1144
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,180
Well, the ducks who do come to his house

1145
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,540
are going to tell him.

1146
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,380
And then he will turn that knowledge

1147
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,980
against the rest of you.

1148
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,540
So it's time to choose your side.

1149
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,460
The line has been drawn in the sand.

1150
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,540
Which, do you want to get through this thing

1151
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,700
and hang out with me and have a kick-ass duck party

1152
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,700
and eat some cool bread for like a day before I run out?

1153
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,700
Or are you going to do duck punishment?

1154
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,820
The choice is yours.

1155
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,540
Love, Griffin.

1156
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,500
And if that doesn't save these fucking,

1157
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,820
these beautiful, beautiful beasts,

1158
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,260
then they're not worth fucking saving, are they?

1159
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,740
Okay, well, it's all clear to me now

1160
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,820
is that you want the ducks to social distance

1161
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,780
away from humans.

1162
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,660
Or I've been social distancing,

1163
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,780
so it's cool if they come,

1164
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,700
if I'm understanding correctly,

1165
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,300
the doctors online and the ones that like come on the TV now

1166
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,220
and talk at me all the time,

1167
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,260
they did say, it's fine if you're isolating,

1168
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,740
go ahead and have a billion birds over to your house

1169
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,020
and you should be okay.

1170
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,980
Well, that'll be good because up till now

1171
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,300
ducks have been so aggressively social with human beings.

1172
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,060
They have no idea that they're not supposed to like

1173
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,340
go to the movies or anything.

1174
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,060
A little too friendly if you ask me.

1175
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,940
So I think that answers the question, right?

1176
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,300
I mean, it's pretty well fucking answered, Travis.

1177
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,460
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1178
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,580
my brother, my brother and me.

1179
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,140
We hope that you are staying sane and hopeful and home

1180
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:36,100
and still managing to keep your spirits up

1181
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,380
during these challenging times.

1182
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,900
We're glad that you've chosen this entertainment product

1183
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,980

1184
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,300
We're so happy to be here with you.

1185
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,380
Normally we'd plug something here.

1186
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,060
But we won't.

1187
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,340
I'll plug John Roderick and the Long Winters

1188
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,220
who let us use their theme song, our theme song,

1189
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,140
it's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1190
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,780
So yeah, go get that now.

1191
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,100
I mean, get it digital, get it digital today.

1192
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,340
Get it digital today.

1193
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,540
In months and months from now,

1194
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,860
when I'm sure everything will be back to normal and fine,

1195
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,620
The Adventure Zone graphic novel book three

1196
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,740
is gonna come out.

1197
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,940
Yeah, that's a good one.

1198
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,500
That's a good one.

1199
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,820
You can pre-order that at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1200
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,820
Just take care of each other.

1201
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,660
You know, wash your hands, take care of each other.

1202
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,140
2 p.m. Thursdays, tune in for Gronk's burrito hour.

1203
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,460
Yeah, I'll be there.

1204
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,180
And it starts in 23 minutes as we're recording this.

1205
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,020
I gotta wrap it up.

1206
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,940
I gotta get my tuxedo on.

1207
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,780
Oh, and real quick.

1208
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,060
So we're doing our first ever live streaming

1209
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,140
Cincinnati Underground Society show.

1210
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,620
Usually only people in the Cincinnati area can come,

1211
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,220
but now anyone can watch.

1212
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,140
It's going to be this Friday, the 3rd, April 3rd,

1213
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,460
8 to 11 p.m. Eastern time.

1214
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,140
And we have a huge lineup of guests.

1215
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,420
It's like 10 or more people,

1216
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,060
including some people who you might recognize

1217
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,060
from some McElroy shows.

1218
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,500
Hint, hint.

1219
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,140
It's a surprise lineup, but I promise you,

1220
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,220
they are all incredible.

1221
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,420
Tickets start at $5, but proceeds go to charity.

1222
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,420
We have chosen a charity that provides equipment

1223
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,900
and supplies for healthcare workers

1224
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,340
responding to COVID-19.

1225
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,300
So it's a great cause,

1226
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,740
and it's going to be a super fun show.

1227
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,900
You can get your tickets at bit.ly slash cuslive.

1228
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,220
That's bit.ly slash c-u-s-s-l-i-v-e.

1229
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,700
This Friday, 8 to 11 p.m. Eastern time.

1230
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,660
Be there.

1231
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,860
It's going to be super fun.

1232
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,700
Thank you so much for listening.

1233
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,340
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

1234
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,620
I don't know who sent it in, though,

1235
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,940
because that part got deleted,

1236
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,940
and we're holding this thing together with twine and tape,

1237
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,060
but I apologize.

1238
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,060
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user yeet, who asks,

1239
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,100
how does one spoon an angel?

1240
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,340
My name is Justin McElroy.

1241
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,020
I'm Travis McElroy.

1242
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,540
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1243
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,900
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1244
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,860
Kiss your dad.

1245
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,860
Square on the lips.
