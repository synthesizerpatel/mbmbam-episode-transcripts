1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,640
an advice show for the modern era. I am Groot. I'm the Rocket Raccoon.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm Dave Bautista, everybody's favorite wrestler, America's wrestler,

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,880
and a movie for some goddamn reason now. Welcome to Guardians of the Galaxy Watch 2014.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,920
We've got Guardians fever here. We're camped out outside the theater for-

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
Brr, it's cold. Brr, hell, we've been waiting for so long.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,080
They keep telling us to come in and that the movie started playing,

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
but we're not ready yet. We're not ready yet.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,480
The anticipation is building. I need to find out,

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,720
I need to maybe read a comic book, find out why there's a goddamn talking raccoon in this film.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
I need to ask somebody who's already seen it if it has a supernatural ending,

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,840
because I find that unsettling. I need to know if any dogs die in the movie.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
From what I understand, there wasn't originally going to be a raccoon in the movie,

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,680
but Bradley Cooper really wanted to be in, and it was the only place they could think to put him.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
Sure, I'll be in your comic book when I shoot pictures is one rule, though.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,800
I've always wanted to be a raccoon. One thing I did enjoy-

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
I want to stand on wooden Vin Diesel's shoulders, please.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,640
One thing I super did enjoy about Guardians of the Galaxy is that it is lighthearted,

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,360
intergalactic action, but it does start with a cancer deathbed scene.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Yep, pretty sweet.

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,480
So you do need to go ahead and pay that toll to get on the fun train.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,400
That should be the start of the Run-P article, like, you can skip the first three bummer minutes.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,440
You must be this sad to ride this roller coaster of a Marvel motion picture.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
It's funny man Chris Pratt out of the can with his dead mom.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
I just think, I wonder if I'm feeling like maybe as a nation,

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,680
we think Guardians of the Galaxy is fun because it swoops you down.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,400
It's sort of a George the Jungle action, swooping down into the jungle floor,

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
then proudly swooping out of it.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,760
The upturn is what makes it seem so fun because they coded the first three minutes in bummer sauce.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,840
I think if you actually go back and you watch up and you watch past the first 15 minutes,

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
you skip those first 15 minutes, you're like, what a fucking boring movie.

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
It's just a little boy and it's just an old man.

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
And they're walking very slowly through the jungle.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,680
Who gives a shit?

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
Give me my space robots.

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
Give me my underwater oceanic adventures.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,880
Give me my Incredibles.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,880
It is absolutely true that without the first three minutes of the Guardians of the Galaxy movie,

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
it's just not that action packed.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,520
It's pretty boring.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,320
There's no, now that I think about it, if I can like cut that part away,

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,720
I don't think there's a single fight scene in the whole movie.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Travis, which Guardian are you?

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
God, I would say I'm a Carrie.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,880
It's Griffin.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,960
Stupid, bonk ass.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Griffin, what about you?

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
I didn't get Travis's joke.

53
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a Sex and the City.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,840
That's what I love, those two minute delay jokes.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,240
Nice slow burn.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,560
Mine's not gonna be as funny as Travis's.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
So should we just start with doing the advice?

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
Yeah, let's just do the advice if you're not gonna be able to top it.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,160
The DM for my Pathfinder.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,680
Fuck yeah.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,240
What?

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
No, come on.

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
Let's get it wet.

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
The DM.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,120
Dungeon Master.

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
District Manager for my Pathfinder.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
It's a role playing game.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:04,960
Group.

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
Just a group.

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,600
Group is just like an assembly of people.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
More than one person.

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
It's hitting on me very aggressively.

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,200
In game?

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,640
Regardless, it's unacceptable.

76
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,400
I'm not interested for a few reasons,

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
the least of which being her track record in dating.

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,640
The worst is that she is recently dating another member of our Pathfinder group.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,160
Okay, so this is her.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
So she has a very limited scope.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeah.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,680
How do I let her down and not get killed off in our next glorious adventure?

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840
That's from Dungeons and Dragons and why is your hand on my thigh?

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,920
Oh, this is the greatest question.

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,360
And they attached, just so you know, the question asker is a dude.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
DM is a woman.

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Okay.

88
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
Clarifying Travis.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
Not that it matters.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
Not that it matters, but they felt the need to include that information.

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Thank you.

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Oh man.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
That's the thing, right?

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,720
Because we could, here's, when you introduce fantasy into the compound,

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
then our regular advice no longer works.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
Because we could say, we could tell you like all the things to do,

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
like be frank, be upfront, be stern, but be gentle.

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Float like a butterfly, break up like a bee.

99
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
But at the same time, you can do that and you can take all the right steps,

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
all the necessary precautions.

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,920
And then all of a sudden, maybe those goblins start rolling a few more critical hits on you.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,960
Mm-hmm.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,760
Maybe to jump that spike trap, maybe that requires a DC 20.

104
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,200
Oh, you had to roll a 46 on that charisma check.

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,160
Ooh, seems like you only rolled a 44.

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
So that is not going to cut it.

107
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,800
You could initiate this flirtation, this relationship,

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,920
but I don't know where it stopped.

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,280
How do you know when it stopped and when it started?

110
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,520
How do you know where the ka-fabe ends and the relationship itself has begun?

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Let me toss the fucking biggest monkey wrench into this machinery.

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,600
If for some reason this leads to this person being forced out of the group

113
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,040
or the role-playing group being dissolved entirely,

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,680
that fucking sucks because it is super, super hard to find a good group

115
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
to play role-playing games with.

116
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Well, oh, then I think right there, you've got a great out.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
I think your out is you can say, listen, I think you're great,

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
especially since she's already dated a member of your group.

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
I don't want to break up the band.

120
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah, like, listen, I think this is great,

121
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,760
but I just really like our time together as friends playing this game,

122
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
and I don't want to complicate that.

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
And I just really need to focus on Gringot, the warrior, right now.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Yeah.

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
And I need to do what's best for him.

126
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,560
Sure.

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
I just need to stand in my truth scroll.

128
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,840
My scroll of truth.

129
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
My scroll of truth?

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,040
I need to chase my bliss potion?

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Man, this is the worst situation, though.

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
You are, because when you're playing D&D,

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
you're playing any role-playing game,

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,000
your DM possesses a, like, fucking 50 shades of gray level of control over you.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Because you got to.

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
It's like a trust exercise.

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
It's improv.

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,760
It's I'm going to pretend to be a dwarven rogue,

139
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
and I'm going to say some dumb shit,

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
and I'm going to trust that you're going to interpret that

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
in these codified role-playing game rules.

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,640
And then to add sex to it, man.

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Well, I am ready to give a piece of advice

144
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,720
we have never given in the history of this show.

145
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
Oh, jeez.

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,520
You need to make yourself less attractive.

147
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Oh, man.

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
You think so?

149
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
Maybe leave a little mud in your jerkin'?

150
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm saying, like, maybe don't be so careful about that Cheetos dust.

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,440
You know what I mean?

152
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Well, you're throwing a lot of shade right now, Travis.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
You're casting a lot of dispersions.

154
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
Well, I think even better if this is the world's most-

155
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
A lot of easy, a lot of low-hanging fruit.

156
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,760
A lot of puns.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,240
If this is the world's most attractive Armani-clad Pathfinder group,

158
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,600
then you have so much more room to fall.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,840
I'm just saying you're magic-missiling down right now.

160
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
You need to magic-missile up.

161
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Does that make sense?

162
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,880
So do you think this person needs to become even more attractive?

163
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm saying that shouldn't be a factor.

164
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
I say, okay, you got-

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
I mean, ugh, it sucks.

166
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
You got to handle it.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
There's no other way to handle this situation.

168
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
There's exactly-

169
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, there's two.

170
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
You can pack your bags and move away,

171
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
but as we've said, that's unacceptable.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
You'll never find another group.

173
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,760
That's it.

174
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,920
I packed my bags and moved away from Cincinnati,

175
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
and I left all my fucking-

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
I left my campaign behind,

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
and I never found another one ever again.

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
So you're going to sacrifice that if you make that jump.

179
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
A lot of people think that adventure grows on trees.

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,600
It does not.

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,000
It does not.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
Well, adventure doesn't have anything to do with it.

183
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,400
It's more like people who can be fucking cool

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
while we all pretend to be wizards and shit.

185
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
For a minute, can you be cool for a minute?

186
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,920
No, no, no, no, no.

187
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Well, I take the priestess by her waist

188
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
and pull her onto my lap.

189
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
I only played, legitimately played D&D once,

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
and my friend Jason was a dwarf,

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
and he ran through a dance floor

193
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
cutting everyone's Achilles tendon and got us thrown out,

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
and that was the last time we ever played

195
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
because he didn't do it right.

196
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
You're not doing it right.

197
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,320
Did you call someone afterwards?

198
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Did you raise some sort of flag with some organization?

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
Someone should keep an eye on Jason.

200
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
Someone just keep them in your prayers.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
You gotta be frank and just say,

202
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,400
listen, I'm flattered, but I really like this group,

203
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
and I just like hanging out with you

204
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,320
in this very limited scope.

205
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Please continue doing this.

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
I'll pay you pizza money for DMing.

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,520
That's like the standard trade-off, I think,

208
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
but I don't wanna go out with you, and I'm sorry.

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
There's also another option.

210
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,720
Please.

211
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
Without knowing how aggressively hitting on you

212
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
aggressively means,

213
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
you could start scaling back your responses

214
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
because right now you're probably playing along

215
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
because you're being nice.

216
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
You don't wanna embarrass.

217
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
No, that's what I'm saying.

218
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,400
You scale it back gradually until eventually

219
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,720
you're not responding to the hitting the same way.

220
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
And so that way, like, if she was asking you out,

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
if she is saying, like, I wanna go out with you,

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
then yeah, you need to be frank

223
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
and you need to be straightforward.

224
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
If at this point, it's just like kind of flirting-

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,560
How can I be frank?

226
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm too busy being Kromlor the barbarian.

227
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm not supposed to be Kromlor and frank now?

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
And Roger.

229
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
Me, my real name and life.

230
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh boy.

231
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,920
Good luck.

232
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
That's how you end up with some mazes and monster shit.

233
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
Yeah, you're gonna find yourself in the tomb of horrors

234
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
of love.

235
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
The tomb of horrors and also love at the same time.

236
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,840
Horror love.

237
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440
Fuck, I wanna play Dungeons.

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,520
Can we please play Dungeons and Dragons, us,

239
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,240
and record it?

240
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,400
Record it and do a podcast.

241
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,360
There's a hunger for it.

242
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,240
There's a need.

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
The people, they need it.

244
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,200
The people fucking need to hear us play Dungeons.

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,240
Griffin, give us the ahu.

246
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,280
I'll do it, yeah.

247
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,720
I like that.

248
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
I know, I've never demanded.

249
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
I thought I would just take control,

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,840
DM this podcast.

251
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Pretty forceful.

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
Somebody better.

253
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,520
How about a yahoo from Troy Hoffmacle.

254
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,480
Thank you, Troy.

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
It's by a suspended yahoo answers user who asks,

256
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,360
could an octopus fire a handgun?

257
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,040
If an octopus could understand a handgun's function

258
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,960
and this handgun could work underwater,

259
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,800
would the octopus have sufficient strength

260
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
and motor control in a tentacle to hold, aim, and fire?

261
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,240
Assume a gun with a mass of around one and a half pounds

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
or seven tenths of a kilo

263
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
and any sort of octopus you like.

264
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,520
Bonus marks, would it be strong enough to do so above water?

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Well, I think that there is one factor of this question

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
that I think is assuming and I don't like it.

267
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,160
What's that?

268
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,080
That the octopus has to understand how the gun works.

269
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
I think it's a way more terrifying

270
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,400
and much more pressing situation to say like,

271
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,840
I accidentally dropped my handgun into my octopus tank.

272
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,240
Yeah.

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,640
Do I need to evacuate the building?

274
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,880
Yeah.

275
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
No, I mean, but I think it would be way scarier

276
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,120
if the octopus not only had motive, right?

277
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,880
I think I see an octopus and I just naturally think

278
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,800
like that's an animal that like wants to kill humans.

279
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,360
Yes.

280
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
And I guess maybe that's my own like Lovecraftian prejudice.

281
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
No, it's nature's purest form of evil.

282
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,300
Right.

283
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,300
I think a octopus that has that malice, that motive,

284
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,140
but also the know-how to fire upon me.

285
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,300
And then like, okay, you have a gun.

286
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,980
An octopus has a gun and you're facing off high noon.

287
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,500
Holy shit, can you imagine like hearing a whistle

288
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,260
or it could click and turning around

289
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,020
and just seeing an octopus just like standing full height

290
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,340
with like two tentacles out holding a gun.

291
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,820
Or six guns in six tentacles.

292
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,060
Okay.

293
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,980
I actually would not be intimidated

294
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,780
by an octopus holding one to two guns

295
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,700
because my assumption is going to be,

296
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,860
well, he doesn't even know how to get more guns.

297
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,100
Right.

298
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,260
If he had six arms, he would have six guns.

299
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,980
He would do that.

300
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,540
I mean, the fucking gun control in this country

301
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,140
is such a goddamn joke that an octopus

302
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,300
probably could buy six guns without a-

303
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,860
Blurrble, blurrble, blurrble, blurrble.

304
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,500
Just please, it's going to be a three-day wait.

305
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,380
Blurrble, blurrble, blurrble, blurrble.

306
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,740
I don't know if we can-

307
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,100
All right, come on out back.

308
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,220
In Octodad's dark sequel, that'll be the opening scene.

309
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,380
Octodad's revenge.

310
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,900
But you're facing off against this motherfucker,

311
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,260
this slimy cephalopod motherfucker.

312
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,420
Where do you shoot that thing?

313
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,980
In the beak.

314
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,740
You can't see his beak.

315
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,780
His beak is not exposed.

316
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,300
It will be exposed after he kills you and engulfs you.

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,820
But until then, the beak, his weak point is not exposed.

318
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,260
Well, I will say this.

319
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,500
I don't know much about encephalopods,

320
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,460
but I'm almost certain their entire body is their weak point.

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,740
They're pretty jelly-filled.

322
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
They're jelly-filled, Travis,

323
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,180
but if you shoot it in the jelly, is that going to stop it?

324
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,740
No.

325
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm saying you can easily penetrate its rind,

326
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,580
but is that going to do any fucking damage?

327
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,100
You're not going to be able to shoot those tentacles off.

328
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,860
He probably tried to run a scam on you.

329
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860
You hid it in the ink sac.

330
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,300
Ink started squirting everywhere.

331
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,660
He's like, oh, you got me.

332
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Look, there's black blood everywhere.

333
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,060
I'm dying. Come over here and check out my-

334
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,940
Come check out my blood.

335
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,980
You shot the ink sac.

336
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,460
My blood is red.

337
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,860
Red is blood of humans.

338
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,740
The drink is my sole source of sustenance.

339
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,940
I think that we are confusing octopuses and squids.

340
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,780
What can I care less?

341
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,420
Fair enough.

342
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,860
They're basically the same thing,

343
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,260
and I don't want to hear from any marine biologists out there,

344
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,020
but they're basically the same animal, right?

345
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,460
Many legs, weird bodies.

346
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,420
They swim in the water.

347
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm saying eyes.

348
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,940
What is also scary?

349
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,740
Mustaches.

350
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,940
They're the same thing.

351
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,420
You know.

352
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,020
What is scarier?

353
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,060
Never pick up the check.

354
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,460
Eight arms can't pick up a check.

355
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,500
That's cool.

356
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,540
Suckers covered in suckers,

357
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,620
covered in sticky appendages,

358
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,900
cannot pick up that check, though.

359
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,820
If you say so.

360
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,980
They are tender lovers, though.

361
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,780
They are.

362
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,340
Fuck.

363
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,140
No, they're not.

364
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,460
They don't know, but you can't spurn them

365
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,780
or they will shoot you six times at once.

366
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,860
That song, I just died in your arms tonight,

367
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,780
it's about somebody who had sex with an octopus

368
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,540
and literally was killed by their arms

369
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,380
because they love to kill humans more than anything.

370
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Octopuses are the anti-horse.

371
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,780
Oh, are we making a fucking statement right now?

372
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,300
If that's the truth,

373
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,580
if that's the truth,

374
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,580
then based on that syllogism,

375
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,100
we have to never...

376
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,300
They are to be the forbidden animal.

377
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,820
They are to be a cursed animal

378
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,700
of which we can never speak again after this segment.

379
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,940
Are manatees the horse of the ocean?

380
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,900
No, stop it.

381
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,380
Seahorse.

382
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,180
They're a cow.

383
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,420
I think seahorses would probably be the horse of the ocean

384
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,500
since that's got sea and then horse.

385
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,980
Yeah, and they also reproduce asexually like horses.

386
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,460
Fair enough.

387
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
And great wishes if you catch them.

388
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,660
Exactly.

389
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,380
My high school was a small private college prep

390
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,940
and pretty close-knit, about 100 people per class.

391
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,620
We have a big alumni program.

392
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,100
My first five-year class reunion is coming up.

393
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,140
Of course, I want to show off my success in the business world,

394
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
but I don't want to look like a total prick.

395
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,460
All right.

396
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,020
The high school is very strict with uniforms and dress codes,

397
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,060
so should my attire be more professional?

398
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,580
I need your help, brothers.

399
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,980
It's from Jaded in Jacksonville.

400
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,420
I do not understand.

401
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,500
Are you asking us for fucking fashion advice?

402
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,940
I think you have two options in this scenario.

403
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,620
You know, full-on like black tie or like white suit,

404
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,460
you know, Monte Carlo kind of shit,

405
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,580
or just like, uh, shorts and a t-shirt.

406
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,860
Yeah, if only there was something in bet-

407
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,660
If only there were clothes in between those two crazy extremes.

408
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,020
No, you gotta go one way or the other

409
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,300
because you either gotta go,

410
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm doing super great, or I don't care what you think of me.

411
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,940
See, it's such a gambit because if I find out

412
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,060
that a super, super rich person is wearing cargo shorts,

413
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,740
that makes me angrier than fuck all.

414
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,580
That's the worst, because it's like, you can afford to dress better.

415
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,380
No, you want to be like me, but you're not like me

416
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,620
because you have so much more money than me.

417
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,580
I'm wearing cargo shorts right now.

418
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,780
What happens when you find out that a really poor person

419
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,980
is wearing a tuxedo?

420
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,340
That makes me angry too, man.

421
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,460
That is bad too.

422
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,420
I think all of our rich people should have to wear finery.

423
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,060
Yeah.

424
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,100
Like all the time.

425
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,980
It should have to be-

426
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,780
Doublets.

427
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,340
Yeah.

428
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,500
Then we'll better know who to mug.

429
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,060
Yeah.

430
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,220
Yeah.

431
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,900
Yeah, that'll make the mugging easier.

432
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,540
Can I tell you how many times I mug a dude in a tuxedo

433
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,940
and he's like, no, I just found this in a dumpster.

434
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,820
And I'm like, fuck.

435
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
He does that sad little pocket out turn

436
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,180
and the flies fly out of it.

437
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,980
I lost it all in the stocks.

438
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,420
If I may make a humble suggestion, by my math,

439
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,700
assuming you went to college, you don't mention that,

440
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,820
but by my math, you are one year out of college.

441
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,060
I'm 33 years old and allow me to advise you,

442
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,340
maybe hold off on the braggadocious nature of your plan right now

443
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,980
because maybe some things might change.

444
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,860
I would not get too cocky about thinking you have it all figured out

445
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,700
on your first year out of college.

446
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,420
I'm glad you have had some success there,

447
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,420
but maybe you don't want to be the guy at the 10th annual reunion

448
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,260
who's like, I have nothing.

449
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,300
I lost it all.

450
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,340
I lost it all.

451
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,220
I would also like to-

452
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,860
You deserved it.

453
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,460
You came festooned to the fifth year.

454
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,140
I would like to address the organizers of this reunion as well.

455
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,420
I'm sure they're listening.

456
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,020
A five-year reunion?

457
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,820
That's five.

458
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,940
Hey, how's your life?

459
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,700
Pretty much the fucking same.

460
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,820
Pretty much exactly the same.

461
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,980
Pretty much the same plus five.

462
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,940
I mean, I went to college, but I literally just finished that.

463
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,660
What did you do?

464
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,340
I went to college and you?

465
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,860
I did go to college though.

466
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,980
I grew this mustache, but I'm probably gonna shave it tomorrow

467
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,340
because I don't really like it all that much.

468
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,700
I've only had it for two weeks.

469
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,660
What did you do in college?

470
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
I drank bad beer and I had sex and was bad at it.

471
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:05,780
Cool.

472
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,660
What did you do?

473
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,620
I had bad beer and I did bad sex too.

474
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,500
Also, me.

475
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,540
I did that.

476
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,140
We were roommates, remember?

477
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,620
Remember?

478
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,060
We had sex with each other.

479
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,260
We had sex with each other and then we drink Coors Light.

480
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,740
Because we didn't know any better.

481
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,620
We didn't know what we were doing.

482
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,500
We're children.

483
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,380
We're childs.

484
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,140
But it's been nice catching up.

485
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,180
I'll see you later.

486
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,220
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

487
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,620
My 10-year reunion's coming up.

488
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,260
It's coming up.

489
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,420
They're trying, impotently I would say, to plan it on Facebook.

490
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,300
There's like one person, and maybe this is Universal,

491
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,420
who is like,

492
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,700
is coming up guys!

493
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,420
Let's meet at this fucking roller skating rink

494
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,780
and just like hammer this shit out.

495
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,340
But like all of us went to the same school

496
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,260
because we grew up in a college town.

497
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,900
So it's more like a six-year reunion

498
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,820
for when we all graduated from the same college

499
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,420
that we went to after high school.

500
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:58,980
Right.

501
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,780
I don't know.

502
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,380
I think 15 is the earliest reunion anyone should go to.

503
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,220
Or deathbed reunion.

504
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,340
Oh yeah.

505
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,820
70.

506
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,500
Oh, you got to hit that point

507
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,980
where your reunion coincides with someone else's.

508
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,380
So like the class of 63 and the class of 2013.

509
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Exactly.

510
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,300
I don't want to know what the fuck

511
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,620
my shithead peers have been up to

512
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,540
for the past five years.

513
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,140
I want to know what to expect

514
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,700
using the education I've received from this institution.

515
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,420
How that's going to carry me through the next 60 or so.

516
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,940
Probably a lot of fear of communism.

517
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,300
Probably a lot of commie stuff.

518
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,660
Whenever I get mad or angry, my nose runs.

519
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,140
I start sniffling and snots want to run all over my face.

520
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,260
For those who know me, it's a dead giveaway,

521
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,540
especially the missus.

522
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,700
It sucks when I'm ironing because my wife and friends

523
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,340
know the moment I get pissed by my snorting.

524
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,620
Even when I tried to blow off the offense, I still snort.

525
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,380
So even though I try to let things drop,

526
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
the boogie stream lets everyone know.

527
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,340
Can we not?

528
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,500
What kind of husband can I be to my wife

529
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,260
if I can't hide my emotions from her?

530
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,060
If you are at a loss, maybe Sydney could help.

531
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,740
All right.

532
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,620
I don't think-

533
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Thanks for that vote of confidence, dude.

534
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,140
I don't think we need to bring Sydney.

535
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,860
This seems sort of-

536
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,460
No, this seems like-

537
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,900
Way below her pay grade.

538
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,180
Yeah.

539
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,980
I, um...

540
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,500
Why are you getting angry?

541
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,660
Why are you getting snotty is the bigger question,

542
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,420
Justin. People get angry.

543
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
Is there an eye patch you could wear on your nose?

544
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,660
Yeah, I saw it on Shark Tank.

545
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,260
I would invest in that.

546
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,420
It's supposed to filter out all the bad stuff,

547
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,020
but I bet it could work as some sort of nasal dam,

548
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,540
keeping the mucus at bay.

549
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,740
I mean, you're gonna dry drown.

550
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,460
I mean, dry drowning is a major risk factor there.

551
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
This is the weirdest superpower I've ever heard.

552
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,420
Yeah, you're like the shitty Hulk.

553
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,100
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry

554
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,020
if we're recording a podcast together,

555
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,780
because you are going to have to edit out a lot of snorts

556
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,140
and a lot of snorfles.

557
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,740
Can I borrow your handkerchief?

558
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,780
Can I please borrow your hand key?

559
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,820
Please say yes, or else it's just going to get worse.

560
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,100
What happens when this guy has a fucking sinus infection

561
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,060
and everyone's like,

562
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,500
fuck Scott, damn Scott, pump the fucking brakes, dog.

563
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Calm down a little bit, Scott.

564
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,820
Oh, I think we're out of Greek yogurt.

565
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,900
Oh, fuck dog, chill out, it's yogurt.

566
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,220
No, I have an infection thing, I'm not mad.

567
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,660
Can you play?

568
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Okay, then you can play it off, right?

569
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,100
If you get angry and you...

570
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,260
And people are like, here it comes.

571
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,820
Scott, I heard the wage gap is starting to close

572
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,940
between men and women.

573
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,620
Wow, Scott.

574
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,220
Wow, all right, fucking cool.

575
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,420
Oh, that's a good one.

576
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,580
Wow, Scott, okay, jeez.

577
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,660
Here's your fedora, blow your nose into that,

578
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,100
you fucking creep.

579
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,580
Get out.

580
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,620
Can you believe it, our first black president.

581
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,060
Scott!

582
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,460
Scott, come on.

583
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Damn, wow, you think you know somebody, jeez.

584
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,980
Scott?

585
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,820
Scott, I wanted to tell you, I'm pregnant.

586
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,180
Oh, you said you wanted it.

587
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,980
Scott, shit, this sucks, man.

588
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,540
This is like, can this person even play poker?

589
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,140
Like it's like a lifetell.

590
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,300
I feel like we need to start doing like a Sarah McLaughlin

591
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,100
style like commercial for pennies a day.

592
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,420
Yeah.

593
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,300
You could help Scott and his weird runny mad nose.

594
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,140
Scott can't enjoy a moment's peace when playing poker

595
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,180
or fighting with his wife because of his boogie streams.

596
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,820
I'm wondering why this only manifests with anger.

597
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,260
Do you think there are other emotions?

598
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,780
That seems, I mean, it's weird all over.

599
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,580
When he gets happy, he gets a lot of earwax.

600
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,220
Oh God.

601
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,060
If he gets a little upset, just a little belly button lint.

602
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,340
He's asking what kind of husband he can be

603
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,100
if he can't hide his emojis though.

604
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,900
A very honest one.

605
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,500
Yeah, I think that's sort of the way to go.

606
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,420
Why would you want to hide your emojis anyway?

607
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,300
You gotta let those things out or they'll back you up.

608
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,540
This is great because you can say stuff like,

609
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
listen, I want you to know that I sniffed.

610
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,140
Not because I was mad at you,

611
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,740
because I was mad at the situation.

612
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,540
And you can be very open and honest with your wife

613
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,860
and take it as an opportunity to let her know

614
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,380
what's really happening inside your head

615
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,140
along with the snot that's above.

616
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,980
Yeah, I think people are going to know what's up in that head.

617
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,980
Let's go to the money zone.

618
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,740
Are you mad that you don't have money?

619
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:46,660
I'm mad about not having money.

620
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,180
I'm wondering if we should have told that dude

621
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,460
to go to the doctor.

622
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

623
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,500
Retcon, go to the doctor, Scott, immediately.

624
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,580
Man, I hope Scott is not the sort of that skips the ads

625
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,100
because he will miss that life-saving message.

626
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,660
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,300
Oh, yeah.

628
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,420
He will drown in his nose.

629
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,140
Well, you know what?

630
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,260
That'll fucking teach him.

631
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,220
Yeah, I'm going to say something that's going to surprise you.

632
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,700
What's that?

633
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,620
You should be snacking more.

634
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,700
I feel like, I mean, I'm glad to hear that.

635
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,860
It is, I suppose, a bit surprising.

636
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,380
Did it fucking surprise you?

637
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,980
I suppose it did, yeah.

638
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,820
Ah, so here's the thing.

639
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,740
I've been running into this because I'm trying to lose some weight.

640
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm moving out to the California.

641
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,420
I want to get my beach body ready.

642
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,300
Oh, Jesus.

643
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,380
And I'm trying to lose a couple of LBs,

644
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,780
10 or 12 LBs, you know what I mean?

645
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,500
You've got a beach, you've got a beach ball body now.

646
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,940
Oh, Griffin.

647
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,460
And so-

648
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,580
I'm going to laugh every time anyone sniffs now.

649
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,660
And so, you know, the wife and I, we're eating the healthy snacks.

650
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,700
And how are we doing that?

651
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,580
Well, it's a great question.

652
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,100
We're doing it through naturebox.com.

653
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,260
Naturebox.com has tons and tons of options of delicious and healthy snacks.

654
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,860
They're not just good, they're good for you.

655
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,100
They're natural.

656
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,980
What are y'all working with now?

657
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,180
I had some cinnamon sugar, like corn kernels.

658
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,380
Had a little vanilla, macaroon, granola for breakfast.

659
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,060
You can eat snacks for breakfast?

660
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,420
That's correct, Griffin.

661
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,700
Oh, wonderful world we live in.

662
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,300
They also had this, the Big Island pineapple,

663
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,620
where you get like kind of like a dried dehydrated pineapple.

664
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,340
So good.

665
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,020
And that's what I was jamming on breakfast for a while.

666
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,540
That and the peanut butter nom noms,

667
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,460
which I don't actually think those are breakfast,

668
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,660
but I'm still a child.

669
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,780
So I was eating something called peanut butter nom noms for breakfast.

670
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,820
I love that dried fruit thing.

671
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,780
That's some quick energy.

672
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm into that.

673
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah, dude.

674
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,940
And they also have savory snacks.

675
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,100
There was some bruschetta pretzels.

676
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,260
Oh, perfect job.

677
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,980
Bruschetta.

678
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,100
Oh, man, I feel like I'm-

679
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,540
One more of those?

680
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,820
Bruschetta.

681
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,740
I feel like I'm basking under the Tuscan sun.

682
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,620
It's like an Italian vacation in a mouth.

683
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,300
They got baked sweet potato fries.

684
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,180
They got all kinds of-

685
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,340
Baked sweet potato fries.

686
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,340
If you like sweet, if you like spicy, they've got it all.

687
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,460
So go check it out.

688
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,900
Maybe a spicy meatball.

689
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,260
No, sorry, I had a stroke.

690
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,220

Such a good deal.

696
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,540
It's a robbery.

697
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,340
You're robbing them.

698
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,940

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,500
I promise you, you'll totally dig it.

707
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,580
We see so many people on Twitter that say like,

708
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,660
I finally tried it and it's awesome.

709
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,220
I loved it.

710
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,660
And my mouth is watering.

711
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,140
My mouth is currently full of water.

712
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,260
I'm dry drowning.

713
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,460
I don't need to know about your flu.

714
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,020
It's Travis.

715
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,860
If you want to have a job tomorrow,

716
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,340
you need to know how to code.

717
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,780
Big promises.

718
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,740
Big promise.

719
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,500
No, this promise works both ways.

720
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,620
It's carrot and stick here.

721
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,420
If you don't have a job, you want a job tomorrow,

722
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,140
you got to learn to code.

723
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,740
If you have a job and you want to still have a job tomorrow,

724
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,940
you got to learn how to code.

725
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,980
How can I do that so fast?

726
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,860
You're asking me, Justin.

727
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,940
If you want a job, but a different job,

728
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,020
and you also want a second job.

729
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,540
If you want nine jobs, you got to learn how to code.

730
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,140
How do you do that?

731
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,220
Well, you're going to get on the one month HTML bus.

732
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,180
One month HTML is the easiest way to learn to code

733
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,300
and build websites.

734
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,860
I've been doing this and here's how it works.

735
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,580
You log onto the site every day.

736
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,660
There are two or three lessons that you do

737
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,420
that are accompanied by a video.

738
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,980
So basically, you watch a video in one screen

739
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,220
and in your second screen, you code a website.

740
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,980
Even if you've never done that before,

741
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,300
it is going to tell you literally step by step

742
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,660
exactly where to go and what to do.

743
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,500
Like moment to moment, step by step,

744
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,860
here's everything you need.

745
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,020
And you're going to start building a website from day one.

746
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
After the first lesson, you will have,

747
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,580
or the first day, you will have a,

748
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,020
admittedly, you know, pretty simple,

749
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,380
but a website that you built.

750
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,740
I built my website, JustinMcElroy.net,

751
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,900
through one month HTML.

752
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,340
Don't go to Justin.

753
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,940
Don't go to JustinMcElroy.com.

754
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,500
It is terrifying.

755
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,620
No, that guy stinks.

756
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,740
No, he's all right.

757
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,620
I guess he's Canadian.

758
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,060
He's Canadian Justin McElroy.

759
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,300
Justin, did you get the email I sent you from Kyle?

760
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,980
No.

761
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,780
Kyle cleaned up the background for your website

762
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,820
so you have a nice clean picture of you gesturing

763
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,900
towards what I assume are the West Virginia hills.

764
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,100
Okay, I will switch that out.

765
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,820
Thank you, Kyle.

766
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,540
I appreciate that.

767
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,460
And here's the best part about it.

768
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,820
They've got other classes.

769
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,860
This isn't the best part about it,

770
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,100
but another part about it, the thing,

771
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,980
is a separate part.

772
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,500
They got a one month Rails class, too,

773
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
if you want to learn to be on Rails.

774
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,180
It's super easy.

775
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,220
It's actually really fun.

776
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,900
I kind of look forward to the lessons every day.

777
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,340
I told them when I started

778
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,020
that the biggest problem I have is stopping every day

779
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,300
because I think the lessons are really fun.

780
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,940
So you can enroll at onemonth.com slash my brother

781
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,580
and you'll actually get 25% off 30 minutes a day

782
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,380
for 30 days and you could have this new skill

783
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,220
and right now you can get it for 25% off.

784
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,660
So go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

785
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,300
That's onemonth.com slash my brother and get 25% off.

786
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm gonna dip in that Ruby, I think.

787
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,500
Let's see what that's all about.

788
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,060
I pretty much mastered all of the other languages.

789
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,140
So I got two real quick messages.

790
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,780
Here's the first one.

791
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,740
There's a podcast about books, which a great idea, I guess.

792
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm not sure there's a lot of crossover there

793
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,700
between people who read books

794
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,620
and prefer to listen to dummies crack wise

795
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,020
about Guardians of the Galaxy, but there you have it.

796
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,780
It's called Tomefoolery and you can check it out on iTunes,

797
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,660
on Stitcher or on their website, tomefoolery.com.

798
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,580
Spelled how it sounds.

799
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,900
Tome, like a book, and foolery.

800
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,420
Like you're saying tomfoolery,

801
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,580
but there's an E in there to make it a pun.

802
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,380
You start back at the beginning, you lost me.

803
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,340
I'm sorry.

804
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,580
You are Enigma wrapped in a mystery.

805
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,700
They've also got a Facebook page,

806
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,380
facebook.com slash Tomefoolery.

807
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,980
Also on Twitter, at Tomefoolery.

808
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,380
Basically twice a month, Cody Melcher and Stephanie Hawes,

809
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,540
who are Chicago-based comedians,

810
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,260
talk about a book with a funny friend of theirs.

811
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,780
They've had people on the show like Tim Kazerinsky

812
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,460
from Saturday Night Live.

813
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,580
Dan Telfer, I guess we can say friend of the show.

814
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,300
Friend of the show.

815
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,940
Friend of the show.

816
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,260
I mean, he introduced us at our first live show.

817
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,740
I'll never forget him for that.

818
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,780
He may not remember us.

819
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,700
He probably doesn't remember us because he was there

820
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,540
when we were the most scared we've ever been

821
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,460
for anything in our lives.

822
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,860
Also got Barbara Gray from Lady Da Lady,

823
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,260
a maximum fun network joint.

824
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,660
Lots of other people, Brandy Posey,

825
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Danny Pewdie from Community.

826
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,780
They've done lots of books from Twilight

827
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,140
to crazy conspiracy books and all kinds of stuff.

828
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,740
So that's Tomefoolery.

829
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,220
It's a book club, but with comedians and weird books,

830
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,780
it sounds like.

831
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,580
And we have another podcast that's supporting the show

832
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,100
this week that you guys should go check out.

833
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,260
It's The Bunker, and it's on iTunes,

834
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,580
or you can go to TheBunkerPodcast.com.

835
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,460
The Bunker Podcast, it's a scripted comedy series

836
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,340
about a breakfast radio show.

837
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,060
Like our show.

838
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,180
Yes.

839
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,900
Fully scripted.

840
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,660
Completely scripted, point A to point B.

841
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,980
And it's a breakfast radio show that takes place

842
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,580
in a post-apocalyptic future.

843
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,380
There's also nice music, stories, and interviews

844
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,300
with storytellers, so go check it out.

845
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,900
TheBunkerPodcast.com.

846
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,580
I mean, if a post-apocalyptic breakfast radio show

847
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,820
doesn't sound funny to you, then get the fuck out.

848
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,420
Get the fuck out of here, kid.

849
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,720
Whoa.

850
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,460
Hey, feeling lonely?

851
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,980
My name's Jesse Thorn.

852
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
My name's Jordan Morris.

853
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,500
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends

854
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,900
get intimate with amazing guests like Maria Bamford,

855
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,980
Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

856
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,300
Jordan Jesse Go is here for you.

857
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,020
Every week, we'll spill our guts for you

858
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,700
and then make some jokes.

859
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,460
Jordan Jesse Go, free at MaximumFun.org.

860
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,940
I got a Yahoo from level 50, 51.

861
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,500
Wow, I guess I downgraded him a little bit.

862
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,580
What did he do?

863
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,020
He's playing a different game.

864
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,340
He has leveled up from 1 to 51 this quickly

865
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,380
in a totally different game.

866
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,820
Anyway, it's Drew Davenport, everybody.

867
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,300
Thank you, Drew.

868
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Uncle Danny Smells.

869
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,020
Uncle Danny Smells asks, how do I eat a Mr. Whippy in public

870
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,540
without looking like a nutcase?

871
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,760
Hold on.

872
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,540
How do I eat a Mr. Whippy?

873
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,300
Mr. Whippy.

874
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,500
Can you guys say that for me?

875
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,700
Mr. Whippy.

876
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,740
Mr. Whippy.

877
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,940
You don't have to do fun voices.

878
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,340
You can just say it.

879
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,140
I wasn't.

880
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,860
Oh, wow.

881
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,700
That's just how that word comes out then.

882
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,200
Yeah.

883
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,180
Wow, okay.

884
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,100
How do I eat a Mr. Whippy?

885
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,620
What is a Mr. Whippy?

886
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,000
Jesus.

887
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,180
I've committed to a bit.

888
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:28,180
Mr. Whippy is a soft serve ice cream cone.

889
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,660
Isn't that the ice cream man in Pete and Pete?

890
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,340
Mr. Whippy?

891
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Possibly.

892
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,060
Mr. Tasty.

893
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,700
Mr. Tasty.

894
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,260
That was right.

895
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,740
Thank you.

896
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
Thank you.

897
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,820
I'm assuming there's an O'Marsh though.

898
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm assuming it's an O'Marsh.

899
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,140
I believe Mr. Whippy is an Australian thing.

900
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,900
Just do a quick Google.

901
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,500
Yeah, Australia and New Zealand.

902
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,500
There's a Mr. Whippy.

903
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,220
But I mean, the idea is I think pretty universal.

904
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,660
We're talking about an ice cream cone.

905
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,540
We're talking about that like weird styrofoam platform cone

906
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,380
that's not especially delicious.

907
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,980
A sugar cone, if you will.

908
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,380
I don't know.

909
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,180
Not even a sugar cone.

910
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,620
What do you fucking call that thing?

911
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,980
It's like insulation.

912
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,140
It's like a structured cone that has like a cone inside of

913
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,700
another cone and there's like joints and shit connecting it.

914
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,780
It's got to have a proper name, right?

915
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,260
Yeah.

916
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,820
I think it's just a standard Mr. Whippy cone.

917
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,140
And then you got the swirl going up of soft serve.

918
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,420
And then you just party on that.

919
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,620
I guess my real question is, and I mean this sincerely,

920
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,380
but I've never seen anyone eat one of those and look like a crazy person.

921
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,460
Well, you've never worked at the country's best yogurt, have you?

922
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Do you see a lot of cool styles?

923
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,060
I'm saying as a former the country's best yogurt

924
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,020
employee of the month, several months running,

925
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,180
I earned that honorific by not fucking laughing at people

926
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,500
who ate Mr. Whippy's in front of me.

927
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,860
And it was hard, Travis.

928
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,820
It was hard.

929
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,180
What were they doing wrong?

930
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,700
They were doing everything wrong.

931
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,180
Let's role play.

932
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,460
Let's D&D this out.

933
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,420
I'll be your DM.

934
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,620
I hand you a Mr. Whippy.

935
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,540
What do you do now?

936
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,340
Roll for initiative.

937
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,100
How do you attack that motherfucker?

938
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,140
Well, first things first, I'm going to take care of that little flipped over

939
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,660
part on the top and just bite that off.

940
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,620
You're going to bite that right off.

941
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:21,860
Okay.

942
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,220
How did you just-

943
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,340
Roll to see if he has sensitive tooth pain.

944
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,580
Do you just sort of position your giant head over this thing

945
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,500
like the mothership in Independence Day

946
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,460
and then sort of lower your gob down onto

947
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,100
and then you sort of encompass it directly like that.

948
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,820
I'm going to be honest.

949
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,420
I'd probably panic and try to bring it from the top to my mouth.

950
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,820
Oh, so you lost it.

951
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,540
You lost the game.

952
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,340
Can I try?

953
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,740
Yeah.

954
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,660
Justin, I hand you a Mr. Whippy cone.

955
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,460
Roll for initiative.

956
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,820
That's my dice roll noise.

957
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,060
Okay.

958
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,780
I extend my tongue just so.

959
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,300
Wait on, slow down, slow down.

960
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,540
Okay.

961
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,980
I extend my tongue just so.

962
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,620
And then I place the Mr. Whippy against my tongue

963
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,380
and then I make this noise.

964
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,940
Is it gone yet?

965
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,580
It's still there.

966
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,940
Can you roll to see if it's still there?

967
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,140
And it's gone.

968
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,620
You did it.

969
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,100
Yay.

970
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,300
Never again do that sound.

971
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,620
Crunch, munch, crunch, munch.

972
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,580
So your strat for down in this month, this bad boy,

973
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,900
is to just do it as fast as possible and hope.

974
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,500
Loudly and graphically as possible.

975
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:36,980
Sure.

976
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It's unpleasantly as human.

977
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,500
Sonic, the most sonically unpleasant consumption strategy I could devise.

978
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,980
Every Mr. Whippy truck has a picture of Justin that says,

979
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,540
do not serve this man.

980
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,580
Do not serve this man.

981
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,820
Very upsetting for local kids.

982
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,620
I mean, I guess it's like a blow job thing.

983
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,820
Like you don't want to like.

984
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,380
Whoa.

985
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,780
No, I'm just saying I think that's what this person's worried about.

986
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,540
Like, how can I eat this Mr. Whippy?

987
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,220
Because if you go top down, then yeah,

988
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,220
I guess there will be some sort of visual similarity.

989
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,180
If you go at it from the side,

990
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,340
you're gonna look like some sort of crazy rancor.

991
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,300
Other than Griffin working at the country's best yoga,

992
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,460
has anyone ever like seen someone buying a cone of ice cream and thought,

993
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,980
well, let's see how he does.

994
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,060
Good luck.

995
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,820
And do you know what's personally-

996
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,860
Come on, hotshot.

997
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,060
Show me what you got.

998
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,700
Do you know what's personally offensive to me

999
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,780
as the fucking superstar of West Virginia's best,

1000
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,060
the country's best yogurt?

1001
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,180
Nobody fucking ever asked me how to do it.

1002
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,620
Nobody, you're there with a fucking pro.

1003
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,460
If you're balling with Michael Jordan,

1004
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,980
you don't just do it in front of him

1005
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,740
and don't ask him to put on a clinic.

1006
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,500
Now here's the thing though,

1007
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,860
but I imagine that even worse than looking like a nutcase

1008
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,300
is worrying about looking like a dude

1009
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,380
who can't figure out an ice cream cone.

1010
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,500
How, Brad, would that have been if someone brought you a cone,

1011
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,060
just like, listen, I can't get from A to B on this bad boy.

1012
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,740
Listen, I tried to come at it from every angle.

1013
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,220
It has nothing to do with doing it.

1014
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,940
Anybody can eat a fucking ice creamed cone

1015
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,820
and anybody can play basketball in front of Michael Jordan.

1016
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,380
Are you doing it perfect?

1017
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,140
Did you ever see somebody like scrolling their phone

1018
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,300
for eHow articles about how the ice cream melting in one hand,

1019
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,300
they're just flipping through pages on their phone on the other

1020
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,820
trying to find that one eHow article

1021
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,940
that's gonna let them get inside the head of this burly beast?

1022
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,620
Let me tell you about it, let me tell you about it.

1023
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,180
It's a multi-stage fight that you're having with this cone.

1024
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,940
And the first two steps are, it's a waiting game at first

1025
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,860
because you really want the bottom to get soggy.

1026
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,780
I know that seems counterintuitive, but hear me out.

1027
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,860
The first stage is all about maintenance

1028
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,140
and it's about discretion.

1029
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,780
You want to try and keep your mouth

1030
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,780
behind the ice creamed portion of the cone.

1031
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,260
You want to keep that ice creamed portion

1032
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,180
between your mouth and any waiting hungry eyes

1033
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,380
that want to see what you're doing

1034
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,060
because they're fucking everywhere.

1035
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,420
What would you think about a strategy

1036
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,100
where you put the whole cone in your mouth

1037
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,860
just for safekeeping and hell there,

1038
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,780
but you kept your mouth kind of spread open

1039
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,500
like inside so that you're not actually touching the ice?

1040
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,060
Like an incubator, no, that sounds great.

1041
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,340
It's not going to work in practice.

1042
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,140
Oh, okay.

1043
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,620
You got to maintain that top discreetly, okay?

1044
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,780
You want to keep dribbles from dripping off you.

1045
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,860
A napkin is helpful in this regard

1046
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,180
if you want to keep it around the styrofoam base.

1047
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,020
Terrific, if that's your prerogative.

1048
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,180
I reached a level of skill where the napkin

1049
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,300
was no longer required.

1050
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,300
No napkins required.

1051
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,260
No napkins required, it was actually kind of embarrassing

1052
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,060
to have it there.

1053
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,380
So you maintain it until you reach that point

1054
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,540
of peak sogginess at the bottom,

1055
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,740
and at that point you've whittled down

1056
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,740
the ice-creamed portion of the cone,

1057
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,460
and then you're going to love this.

1058
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,900
You guys are going to fucking love this.

1059
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,620
You pick up the cone, hold it above your head

1060
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,380
like an ice-creamed beer bomb,

1061
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,820
and you bite the bottom directly off of it.

1062
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,060
All of a sudden, you're playing an upwards trumpet

1063
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,900
to the heavens, and that ice cream

1064
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,020
is just going to fucking power blast down your throat,

1065
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,980
and you're going to love it.

1066
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,260
And then what do you got there?

1067
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,060
You have the perfect, the styrofoam has soaked up

1068
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,460
the cream in such a pleasing manner,

1069
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,700
you can just fold that little gushy baby up

1070
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
and just go to town.

1071
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,500
You have three distinct levels of strategy

1072
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,860
and three unique textures, three unique flavor experiences.

1073
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,580
It is the only way to down a Mr. Whippy.

1074
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,900
I like it when they put the cone on top

1075
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,180
and then decorate it with ice-cream

1076
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,380
to make it look like a clown.

1077
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,020
Get the fuck out of here.

1078
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,300
I have a different strategy.

1079
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,980
You could use the Justin Baccarat.

1080
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,060
Step one, suck it like it's a dick.

1081
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Step two, play air guitar.

1082
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,820
Step three, high-five every kid in the store.

1083
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,300
That also works, yeah.

1084
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,700
What I like to do is I take one bite

1085
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,860
and I say, too hot, and I throw it on the ground.

1086
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:00,900
That's great.

1087
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,940
Brothers, if you have a drink with you

1088
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,380
but you need to go to the restroom

1089
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,060
and have no one to watch your drink for you,

1090
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,260
what do you do with the drink?

1091
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,620
If it's not in a resealable bottle,

1092
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,380
bringing the drink with you seems gross.

1093
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,900
If there's a lot left and chugging it seems like a waste,

1094
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,700
that's from perplexed and peeing.

1095
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
It says pissing, you can say it.

1096
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,740
I know, I just thought it would be better to not.

1097
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,220
And from perplexed and making water.

1098
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,300
It's a tricky situation

1099
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
because I'm telling you,

1100
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,060
if you've got a big, tall, steamy glass of apple juice

1101
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,660
and you bring that in and out,

1102
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,340
that's the situation.

1103
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,860
If you've got Coca-Cola, less of a situation.

1104
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,340
Especially if you're at a bar, there's two.

1105
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,820
Okay, so on the less extreme side,

1106
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,780
you worry about the bar back coming over

1107
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,100
and clearing your glasses and taking your glass.

1108
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,380
And then two, there's always that risk

1109
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,300
that someone's gonna put some fucking shit in your drink

1110
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,180
because people are awful.

1111
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,980
Kiss people are the worst.

1112
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,580
I'm gonna be honest,

1113
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,020
I've never thought about it before this moment.

1114
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,540
I always just take my drink in with me.

1115
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,780
But now I'm thinking about the air being full

1116
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,900
of, you know.

1117
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,100
Of pee.

1118
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,220
Yeah, pee air.

1119
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,340
Pee air that the fucking bathroom door magically

1120
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,100
and hermetic, the bathroom airlock

1121
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,700
magically keeps those pee particles from.

1122
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,740
I'm not saying that's going to stop me from doing it.

1123
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,860
I'm saying I recognize where perplex is coming from in this

1124
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,460
that like, oh, suddenly if you're going like,

1125
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,740
oh, taking your bath and drinking the bathroom seems gross.

1126
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,460
Yeah, no.

1127
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,860
But I don't see how it's any actually grosser

1128
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,660
than all of the horrible people that are out in the bar.

1129
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,900
I mean, we've talked about the many, many fallacies

1130
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,340
surrounding bathroom, like,

1131
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,620
contamination, I think.

1132
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,220
I think we've pretty much, like,

1133
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,620
I have talked about how I can pee without ever touching it.

1134
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,580
It being my penis.

1135
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,380
And you should not, as a result, have to wash your hands.

1136
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,740
I shouldn't need to.

1137
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,220
My, the front of my jeans aren't dirty, dad.

1138
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,620
The front of my jeans-

1139
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,300
You can get a special t-shirt that says that

1140
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,060
so you don't have to go explaining it every time

1141
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,860
you use the restroom.

1142
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,340
I don't touch-

1143
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,140
Hands free.

1144
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,940
Hands free, no winging or touch, no scope, 360, pee shot.

1145
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,500
Front of my jeans aren't dirty, so I didn't wash my hands, dad.

1146
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,740
And then on the back, you got a problem with that?

1147
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,420
And it'll be a picture of me shrugging my arms

1148
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,460
in a, like, threatening manner.

1149
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,580
That's on presale now.

1150
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,820
It's on presale now, you can get the maximum foot store.

1151
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,540
No look.

1152
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,900
It says daddy's best boy, 2014.

1153
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,340
Daddy's best boy.

1154
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,020
No look, no scope, pee shot.

1155
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,100
And on the other sleeve, it says in memory,

1156
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,700
in loving memory of Big Darryl.

1157
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,180
Gone but not forgotten, never forget, mother forever.

1158
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,700
Angels only leave paths on your heart

1159
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,220
from the tracks in your tears to the strain of the angels.

1160
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,380
It's a big shirt.

1161
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,020
I love you, Big Darryl.

1162
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,060
It's not a huge, puffy sleeve to accommodate all of the text.

1163
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,180
Thank you for teaching me your no-scope pee ways.

1164
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,220
You were the best.

1165
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,980
You were the best stranger.

1166
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,820
Nobody's gonna step to you.

1167
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,380
No one's gonna step to you with that shirt.

1168
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,940
Just get in their face, one v one me, if you don't believe it.

1169
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,500
If you don't believe me, I'll be right next to you.

1170
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,860
Get that black light.

1171
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,740
Yeah, let's scope the front of my jeans.

1172
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,020
Nothing there.

1173
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,060
Yeah, just take your fucking drink in.

1174
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,260
Y'all want a Yahoo?

1175
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,660
Yep.

1176
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,540
This Yahoo was...

1177
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:46,260
This Yahoo was sent in by Cameron Ogier or Ogier or Ogier.

1178
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,940
Ogier.

1179
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,060
Okay, sure.

1180
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,620
Thank you, Cameron.

1181
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,220
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ogiao.

1182
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,420
A lot of, come on.

1183
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,100
Who asks, how can I become an aristocrat?

1184
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,900
I'm spellbound by the culture, history, and essence of the British aristocracy,

1185
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,220
particularly by the English aristocrats of deepest Yorkshire,

1186
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,700
with their magnificent rolling estates and majestic country houses,

1187
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,140
towering stallions and grand dinner parties.

1188
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,820
I want to be an aristocrat.

1189
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,980
I've spent some time visiting country houses, cathedrals, abbeys,

1190
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,860
and in historical monuments rooted in the heritage and culture of the old England.

1191
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,020
And I think that in order for me to fully absorb the essence of British heritage,

1192
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020
I must become an aristocrat.

1193
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:39,860
I want my own beautiful estate, my own gorgeous old country house with luxurious drawing rooms

1194
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:45,140
and paintings of kings, queens, nobles, and personalities of the British chivalry.

1195
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,060
I want to be a part of this world.

1196
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,260
If there's one thing I know,

1197
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,820
it is that you dress for the job you want.

1198
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,320
Sure.

1199
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,980
So I think you need to go full on fox hunt outfit 24-7.

1200
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,900
Welcome to Dinny's, sire.

1201
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:10,660
So in conclusion, Mr. Bank Officer, that is why I need one million pounds.

1202
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,740
That's not going to do it, I don't think.

1203
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,820
Unless you do like a time travel issue,

1204
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,740
unless you do like a time travel issue, like I don't think,

1205
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,700
I don't think the million pounds is going to do it.

1206
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Well, I also don't know what conversion rates are.

1207
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,260
I think that's like six billion dollars.

1208
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:36,100
Listen, we all watched Downton Abbey and we pretend to know how the fuck any of that shit works.

1209
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,580
Why do they have all that stuff?

1210
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,540
I never see them paying rent.

1211
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,220
They never pay rent or mortgage and they just get money.

1212
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,820
We have to manage the lands.

1213
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,740
Cool, I mow my fucking lawn every other weekend.

1214
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,540
I don't get paid billions of pounds, sir.

1215
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,060
The game's keeper watches over the herd of deer that lives on the ground.

1216
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,820
Do those deers shit gold?

1217
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,740
I got squirrels.

1218
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,100
You will never hear them like,

1219
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,140
Listen, we have to get on our paper chase.

1220
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,820
We gotta get that paper.

1221
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,540
Get on the grind, everyone.

1222
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,900
We have to get that paper.

1223
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,940
I think it's just like,

1224
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,100
Turn the light off.

1225
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,860
Were you born in a barn?

1226
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,260
Every light in the manor is on.

1227
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,780
Turn down for what?

1228
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,100
Interesting.

1229
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,380
I do remember when the Duchess had turned down for what?

1230
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,380
Is it just like a situation where somebody,

1231
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,900
maybe they invented the quill or some shit and they just made like a trill?

1232
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,460
A quill?

1233
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,740
A trill from that quill?

1234
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,340
And then they just sort of coast on that?

1235
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,660
Is it possible that no one,

1236
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,100
castles are too sweet and no one can own them?

1237
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,260
So you just roam the English countryside looking for one that's full of skeletons?

1238
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,180
You think, well, okay, this is mine now.

1239
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,660
Yeah.

1240
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,940
This is my castle.

1241
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:07,460
I'd be willing to bet that if you asked any aristocrat or just old, old blood aristocrat,

1242
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,700
how did your family become aristocrats?

1243
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,940
Their response would be, well, we've just always been.

1244
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,900
I don't remember.

1245
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,500
Do you think maybe it was like ordained by God?

1246
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,340
Like God created the heavens and earth.

1247
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,780
He made the light and the dark.

1248
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,220
He made the oceans and the land.

1249
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,940
And then he made some people like really super rich forever.

1250
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,180
Yeah.

1251
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,500
Hey, good, good, good news.

1252
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,300
The Williamses.

1253
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,140
Your cup.

1254
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,500
Y'all are fucking set.

1255
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,740
You prayed the right way.

1256
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,220
Not you.

1257
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,340
Pray more like them.

1258
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,740
Not you.

1259
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,860
The Williamses.

1260
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,060
You heard me wrong.

1261
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,460
Billions.

1262
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,900
You missed it by one letter.

1263
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,300
Their family, their family's last name will be forgotten throughout the ages.

1264
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,580
The Williams.

1265
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,420
You are my least favorite family.

1266
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,380
You get nothing.

1267
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,460
But when you enter into my house, you will get room, I guess.

1268
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,660
You'll get, you'll do okay.

1269
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,100
The Meek shall inherit the earth.

1270
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,980
Except for the Williamses who get everything.

1271
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,660
I don't know, man.

1272
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,580
It seems like a pretty cool fucking scene though.

1273
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,580
I mean, except for all the indentured servitude.

1274
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,620
Dude, other than that, pretty cool scene.

1275
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:16,260
The weird thing about the Downton Abbey, the life that is presented there in the aristocracy,

1276
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,500
is like for people that don't have to do anything, they do a lot of things.

1277
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,780
Like they are very busy inventing purpose.

1278
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,100
Like yeah, and they also have a lot of stakes.

1279
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,540
They have really high stakes.

1280
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,420
Yeah, like super high stakes for somebody who never has to worry about anything.

1281
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,300
Why isn't there one, like realistically, why isn't there one member of the Downton Abbey

1282
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,220
sect that's like...

1283
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,900
Smoke weed every day.

1284
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,380
That's my jam.

1285
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,340
That's where I'm at.

1286
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,820
I mean, this totally chill dog found a cool tree.

1287
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,060
We're going to smoke weed and sleep under it.

1288
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,060
For the next two weeks, because fuck it.

1289
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,980
I made this hand sculpted bong.

1290
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,380
I was going to sell them, but then I was like, fuck it.

1291
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,900
I would like to see an episode of Downton Abbey where the entire DVD episode is an hour long

1292
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,140
and it's one of them just wandering through the house trying to find another family member

1293
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,300
to hang out with because they're super fucking bored.

1294
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,540
Yeah.

1295
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,500
Anyone want to chill?

1296
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,560
Steven?

1297
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,260
Is there anyone in here?

1298
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,620
No?

1299
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,180
Servants?

1300
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,900
Just want something to do.

1301
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,420
Got the new masters on EP.

1302
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,420
Anybody?

1303
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,740
Want to make a pizza?

1304
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,060
Do you want to make pizza?

1305
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,620
Homemade pizza?

1306
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,100
I got some sweet shrooms.

1307
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,420
Yes, both kinds.

1308
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,780
Smoke weed every day.

1309
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,020
Anybody?

1310
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,180
Got Jenga?

1311
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,980
I invented Jenga.

1312
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,660
Anybody?

1313
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,700
I'm Laura Linney.

1314
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,620
You're watching Masterpiece Theater.

1315
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,340
Last week, we watched as Bernie found the dankest herb and enjoyed it with his good,

1316
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,380
good dog.

1317
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,580
They chilled under a tree and slept for six hours, then made pizzas.

1318
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,220
What will happen this week?

1319
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,260
On Turn Downton...

1320
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,540
Ah, fuck, I blew it.

1321
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,100
Will Ronson's brother return from the war and will Bernie find another dope stash of

1322
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,300
high quality ganja?

1323
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,580
Travis, stick it again.

1324
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,540
You can land it this time.

1325
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,060
Next on Turn Downton for what theater?

1326
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:24,840
Damn it.

1327
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,000
Ah, fuck.

1328
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,480
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1329
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:37,000
It's an advice show that we do every week with each other and you can listen to it if

1330
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,500
you want.

1331
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,320
And it's just a show to help you out.

1332
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,600
What more do you want from us?

1333
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Thank you for people tweeting about the show.

1334
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,920
Our boy Nick Roberts recommended it to Morgan Kitten.

1335
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,840
Hopefully Morgan Kitten is listening.

1336
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,800

Thank you.

00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,960
You're the best for tweeting about our show.

1340
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,960
So thanks.

1341
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,720
And we want to say thanks again to our friends at Nature Box who have been supporters of

1342
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,640

1344
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,120
You can order great tasting, healthy snacks in all different forms and functions.

1345
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,680
Get in shape for summer and get that beach body stuff.

1346
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
I think the function is going to be the same.

1347
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,120
Yeah, okay.

1348
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,160
All forms and the same function that you eat them and then digest them.

1349
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,120
You like it.

1350

1352
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,640
It's totally worth it.

1353
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,200
You're welcome.

1354
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,960
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1355
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,680
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1356
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,760
I don't know what to say, guys.

1357
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,800
What I haven't said already.

1358
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,160
It's a fucking action packed way to start the show off.

1359
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,600
But there's a lot of slow jams on there, too.

1360
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,800
A lot of slower cuts, a lot of more pensive tunes.

1361
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,880
Check out the record.

1362
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,000
I also want to thank everybody who has been sharing the YouTube videos we've been posting

1363
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,120
and telling everybody about it.

1364
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,480
You guys have been really, really awesome.

1365
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,200
Thank you so much.

1366
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,920
If you haven't gone to check it out, it's YouTube, it's MBMBAM.

1367
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,200
We put up some animated videos.

1368
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,640
We're putting up old episodes.

1369
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,920
There's live live show videos.

You guys are awesome.

1373
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,340
Yep.

1374
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,400
That's going to do it for us.

1375
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,080
I guess this week.

1376
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,440
Listen to the other Max.

1377
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,680
Listen to the other shows of the Max Fund Network too.

1378
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,400

00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,440
Are y'all still putting Eps out or are you on hiatus?

1382
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,040
No, no, no, we're in it.

1383
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,180
All right.

1384
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,440
They make that show for you and it's really good.

1385
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,920
So go listen to it.

1386
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,480
And yeah, final question time, I guess.

1387
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,720
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

1388
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,280
Are you Ira Ray?

1389
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,400
Who wants to know?

1390
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,520
Thank you very much, Ira Ray.

1391
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Snow Bunny Love 420 who asks,

1392
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,720
did Kenny Rogers change his name to Kenny Loggins?

This has been my brother.

1397
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,800
My brother may kiss your dad.

1398
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:32,200
School hair on the lips.

00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,320
Oh, yeah.

1407
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,040
We have a show, don't we?

1408
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,920
We have a show.

1409
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,760
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

1410
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,560
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

1411
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:55,880
Yeah.

1412
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,960
Like the Tony Alamo Ministries cult.

1413
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,360
Yep.

1414
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,880
That's led by a pedophile.

1415
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,600
He's in jail.

1416
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,800
He's in jail.

1417
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,280
Also, we became Mormons.

1418
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,520
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

1419
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,080
That's right.

1420
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,240
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

1421
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,640
Yes.

1422
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,320
The 9-11 truthers.

1423
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,040
We got cupped.

1424
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,000
We got acupunctured.

1425
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,720
We got reiki.

1426
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,760
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

1427
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,440
that doesn't sound quite right.

1428
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,400
We've done that.

1429
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,920
So you don't have to do it.

1430
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:32,040
So if you want to hear about this, and you should, then go to maximumfun.org.
