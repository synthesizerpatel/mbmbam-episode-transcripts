1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother Made Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my notes here. Oh, yep,

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I guess that just leaves the baby brother,

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,160
Griffin McElroy, for me. Is that the one you're gonna be?

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,960
That's who I'm gonna be this time. I wanna be that character.

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,040
Yeah, I hear he's the blonde one that drives all the babes wild.

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,600
He drives the babes wild, he's got better stats, and he can fly, so.

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
But he has one weakness, chocolate.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
Hey, what's the intro this time, though? Glass watch.

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Glass watch. We're gonna watch glass, I guess.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,640
We're gonna make and watch glass. We're gonna blow glass.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Mr. Shyamalan is back with his bold vision. His Marvel Cinematic Universe.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,120
His Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is, I have to give Mr. Shyamalan credit for continuing

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,960
with this project because my man did Unbreakable back in the Halcyon days.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Yes. 2000. Follow that up.

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,360
Just took a brief break of 16 years and said, hey, I got another one,

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,600
but it's a secret, and I'm not gonna tell you it's one of mine, one of this kind.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,320
That's the best way to promote any movie, by not telling people that it might be

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,560
related to a movie that they actually did like back in the past.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,840
Yeah, so this one's got Unbreakable Guy, which was his formal name.

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
Mr. Glass, of course. Samuel L. Jackson's turn.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
It has the nasty man from the movie.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah, Angry McAvoy.

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,120
Angry McAvoy, the nasty man from the movie that very few people watched,

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
so he's gonna be cool. It'd be like if they did Avengers,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
and one of the Avengers was Electra.

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
And I'm also reading here that Superman is in this one.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
Superman's in this one. They have village monsters in this one.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
They got Paul Giamatti from Lady in the Water in this one.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
People are stoked out of their fucking minds about that.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Wait, was that him? No, that was Robert Rodriguez, wasn't it?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, it was a different person altogether.

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
Bryce Dallas Howard in two roles is very exciting.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,320
We're excited to see what she brings to the table.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
The water aliens are in this one.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Yeah, water aliens in it.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Asmatic Boy from Signs is in it.

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm very excited to see how he fights all the monsters,

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,400
and I hear him and Nasty Man have a big tussle, so psych for that.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,520
The ninja in the water.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,760
The ninja in the water's back.

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,120
The Avatar, both The Last Airbender and The Navi, they're all in it.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,320
I was looking up the dates of these flicks on Wikipedia,

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,520
and looking at the names of the films altogether,

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,160
it sounds like you're returning a faulty product.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,720
Unbreakable split glass, huh?

51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Oh, no.

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
Guess it ain't so, huh?

53
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
Because it's split glass, it's supposed to be unbreakable.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
I would like a full refund.

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,800
Now, the character I'm worried is going to be a little overpowered

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,600
in this new superhero team is The Happening.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Because The Happening is just a thing in the wind

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
that makes people just go wild and do bad stuff,

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
and it's sort of just wind.

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
So I don't even know how they show that shit on a poster,

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
but I'm excited, this movie's going to be so fucking badass.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you guys ever think about the fact that M. Night Shyamalan

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
made, I would say, some bangers early on,

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,320
but then was also responsible for The Last Airbender after Earth?

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Yeah.

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,000
The Happening, like some major, I would say, El Zilchos.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm glad someone has those fucking guts.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Yeah, finally, someone's putting that guy in his fucking place

69
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,720
while reflecting on his former successes.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Truth to Shyamalan, he obviously, much like Mr. Glass,

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
has greatness within him, and he just needed the right people

72
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
around him to help bring it out.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,200
And those people are not Mark Wahlberg, apparently.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
Apparently Mark Wahlberg brings out the worst.

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
He brings out some bad stuff, y'all.

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
I and my lemon drink.

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Hey, fellas, let me ask you this, though.

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Do you think, post-credits, I heard a rumor,

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
the elevator's in it.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
Remember he made a elevator movie,

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
and that was kind of the last one where he's like,

82
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
let me just get in there and make a elevator movie.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
And we were like, I think it's done, bud.

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,520
So excited.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Do you guys think there'll be a twist in this one?

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
I just-

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
Some kind of twist?

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,640
Were you expecting it to be different,

89
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
but then it's something else?

90
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,600
I want to warn you all, if I see Freddie Prinze Jr.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
and Rachel Lee Cook show up, I'm going to lose my damn mind.

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Wait, what?

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
If we're bringing back, well, She's All That,

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,480
you know, the hit film She's All That

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
that was written by M. Night Shyamalan.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,040
What?

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,760
If they show up with Stuart Little on their shoulder,

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm going to lose my damn mind.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Did he write those films?

100
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
Hell yeah, he did.

101
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
I thought you were a Shyamalan maniac.

102
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,320
I didn't expect his career to have a Shyamalan twist in it.

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
His career has one.

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,960
This year, in the year of our Lord, 1999,

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
he did The Sixth Sense, he wrote She's All That,

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
he wrote Stuart Little, and then Hollywood was like,

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
good year, good year, please have the next 20 years on us.

108
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
So I'm going to be in this theater fucking open,

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
if they do midnight showing, I'm in here,

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
I've got to know, I've got to know.

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,560
Midnight Shyamalan?

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
I must fucking know.

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
Is that what the M stands for?

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,080
Absolutely, Midnight Shyamalan.

115
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
My name is Midnight Shyamalan, the M is for mid?

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,240
So do we, I'm done talking about,

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
I feel like we were mean, and now we just go on.

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
This is the end of it.

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
This is the last film in the trilogy.

120
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,320
Sure.

121
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,640
The trilogy of films, this is the third one,

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,840
and I was sad to hear that it's a trilogy,

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,600
but then I got happy again, because Wikipedia says,

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,200
that he said that he's open to making another one

125
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
if he gets a good idea.

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
Fuck yes.

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
I guess he has become seasoned with age,

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
and will wait to make a movie until he does have a good idea,

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
which I think is good and inspiring.

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Season with age is a good way,

131
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,200
his career is kind of like that old cast iron pan

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,080
that you got in your drawer,

133
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
and you're not supposed to wash it,

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
but it's got a little bit of happening in it,

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
but it still has that sixth sense spice in it.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
But you had to let the happening burn in it a little bit.

137
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,360
A little bit.

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
To get that crust, to get that village crust on it.

139
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
So I'm wondering if Freddy Rodriguez

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
and his one big strong arm from Lady in the Water

141
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,160
is going to be in it.

142
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Just the arm.

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,600
Just the arm, his one big strong arm.

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey, let's do some questions.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm sorry, I thought we were going to talk about

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
M. Night Shyamalan.

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
Were you Googling some more?

148
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,080
Oh, sorry, were you loading up the canon juice?

149
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Just a little of the canon for the great M. Night Shyamalan.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
Well, go ahead and blast that shit.

151
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,320
I don't want you to get us stuff in canon, go ahead.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,480
I like more of his films that I don't like,

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,240
and I feel like that might be good.

154
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
I feel like that might have gotten lost in translation.

155
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,640
He's taken a big swing.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
He wrote lost in translation?

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
Come on now.

158
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,000
Come on now.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,760
I know that even he would look at the happening and say,

160
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,800
this one I duked.

161
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
On this one is dooky.

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,600
This one is a dooky for me.

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,840
There's a W column, there's an L column.

164
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
There's no shame in ending up in either one of those columns.

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,040
But there is another column to the right of the L column

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,080
that is the D column.

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
This for films you dookied.

168
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
And listen, we've dookied a few episodes.

169
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,640
I hear it.

170
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
But I think even M. Night Shyamalan would say,

171
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,320
I dookied the happening, the lemon drink thing,

172
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
the whole, actually all the bits.

173
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
Watching Spencer Breslin get absolutely fucking bodied

174
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
with a shotgun in the fucking face.

175
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Oh no.

176
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
That picture, that picture though.

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
So hey, what's up next?

178
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
Oh boy.

179
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
Sorry, just really good.

180
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,520
My dad is a proficient woodworker.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
He's retired.

182
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
So he spends a lot of time in his workshop,

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,960
but he rarely builds things for himself.

184
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,200
He's a very generous man and loves,

185
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
is this your dad's grinder page or like a question?

186
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,280
Okay, he loves building things as gifts for people.

187
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
However, he sometimes goes overboard and builds things

188
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
for people he barely knows.

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,400
For example, he recently told me he built a jewelry box

190
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
for a waitress at a local diner.

191
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,520
Then he made the waitress's boyfriend a cutting board

192
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,760
so he wouldn't get the wrong idea.

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
Yowza.

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
Yay, yay, yay, yay.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
How do I tell my dad that this is weird?

196
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,880
Okay, wait, on the one hand, it is weird.

198
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
But on the other hand, free jewelry box and cutting board.

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Yeah, I mean, you can't argue with that, Trav.

201
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
Free stuff is free stuff is free stuff.

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
And we love it in this country.

203
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,160
The giving a jewelry box to a person you don't know

204
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,880
is the strain.

205
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
A cutting board is great because a cutting board,

206
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
I get that from a woodworker and I say,

207
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
this is handy for me and you did not work very hard on it

208
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,440
because it is just wood.

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Thank you, Dennis.

210
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,440
It's a board, Dennis.

211
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,800
Thank you so much.

212
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,080
I see that you've sort of carved in very crudely

213
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,680
Griffin's chopping zone, and that's fun and I like it.

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
That is going to get food in it, though,

215
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
and that's a problem.

216
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,680
It's gonna be gross, but I appreciate this.

217
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
Took you three minutes to make,

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
and that's about how I value our friendship, too,

219
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,280
because I do not know you except for when you come

220
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,320
to this TGI Fridays, thank you so much.

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
The cheese balls will be here very soon.

222
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
I would say, though, you can't say giving a present

223
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,120
to someone you don't know is bad because Santa Claus.

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Santa Claus.

225
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
Yep, that's true, Trav.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Santa Claus gets me stuff sometimes and I think,

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
is this dude in love with me or what?

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Like, he gets me a fancy watch and I'm like,

229
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,520
is this dude in love with me?

230
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,360
Because I don't know him from Adam.

231
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960
You gave him a list, though, Griff.

232
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
You give him a list every year

233
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,520
in that sweet little stationery or cinema list.

234
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
That's just asking for things that you get.

235
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
That's not the same thing.

236
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,240
I just don't.

237
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
Sometimes he gives me stuff not on the list

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
and sometimes it's like, you know,

239
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,280
one time he got me undergarments from the undies

240
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,440
and I'm like, Santa Claus, that's a little,

241
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
do you want to see me in these, bud?

242
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm not saying no.

243
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
It's just like, I don't know you.

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,920
Oh, I have a great solution question, Aster.

245
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Set your dad up with an Etsy shop

246
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
and say something like,

247
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,120
Dad, you're giving all this stuff away for free.

248
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
Let me set you up.

249
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll post the pictures.

250
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
I'll take care of this for you.

251
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,800
And like that way, if your dad wants to give stuff out,

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
he still could, but he can include like a business card

253
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
with a link to a shop and say,

254
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
and tell your friends about this.

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,280
That's good.

256
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,640
And that way it's not as weirdly personal.

257
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,840
I can sympathize with this because I love to bake.

258
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,840
A lot of times I find myself baking a whole tray of things.

259
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,040
Nobody bakes, you know, three cookies.

260
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,960
You got to bake a pan of them.

261
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,480
And I don't know who to give them to.

262
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
So they end up maybe going to waste

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,760
or eventually we take them to the other people at the hospital

264
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
or city works out or whatever.

265
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
But on the flip side of that,

266
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,920
I often find myself wishing that I had something.

267
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
It doesn't matter what.

268
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,680
It could be anything.

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
Maybe I want some food.

270
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,960
I wish someone would make me some food, I think to myself,

271
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,560
but there's nowhere to turn.

272
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
Well, hold on.

273
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,840
I just clicked to the next slide.

274
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,440
Well, I'm so glad that you joined me here for this.

275
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
Has this ever happened to you sharks?

276
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,680
Well, I'm happy to announce my new app Freebie.

277
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,760
And there's eight E's in there.

278
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
So just it's trademarkable.

279
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,160
No problem.

280
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
Freebie is a social network

281
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,840
where you can put in something that you want to make

282
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,520
and then other people put in things that they want

283
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,880
and then the app connects you.

284
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
And then you just make the things

285
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
and they don't go to waste

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
and people get the things that they need and want.

287
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Every time this transaction occurs,

288
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
they both pay me $17.

289
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,720
I got to say it's exciting

290
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
and I see where the revenue stream is going to come from.

291
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,760
Thank you talking shark.

292
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,240
Me, I do say, I got to say this.

293
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,280
I already invest in an app called Freebies

294
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,640
and it's where they give away all the bees that they eat.

295
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,680
It's where you can get bees on sort of gratis.

296
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
So I'm out.

297
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Shark Cuban here.

298
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,400
I already have invested in a website called Free the Bees,

299
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,560
which is all about getting the bees out of prison.

300
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,560
So far, so good.

301
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
As far as I know, there aren't any bees in prison.

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
So it's going well.

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
It was a good investment, I think.

304
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,080
But this brings me to, I am a fan of bees.

305
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
I did kind of zone out for most of your presentation.

306
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
I assume it does include bees.

307
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
So you've stopped talking.

308
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Are there bees?

309
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,960
Which says to me, your comedy partner, Justin McElroy,

310
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,640
that you didn't listen to what I said

311
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,000
closely enough to build on it,

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
but you do want me to,

313
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
you've put, I drove over to your house with a hot joke.

314
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,440
And then you said, screwed over.

315
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,280
And then you drove me back to my house

316
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,760
with that same now cooled stale joke.

317
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
I did say the thing about Shark Cuban.

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I don't know how much more you want, Frank.

319
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,440
You want me to make two jokes?

320
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,280
Travis has, there's yes and no, but,

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,520
and Travis had one, this also.

322
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
Yeah, my thing now.

323
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
And a fourth one, this instead is good also.

324
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,480
How about a yahoo?

325
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,200
I got a yahoo.

326
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,520
Here's one from Lawrence Evelyn.

327
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,240
Thank you, Lawrence.

328
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,560
It's yahoo answers user, Billy, who asks,

329
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,200
is it time to force dogs to wear underwear?

330
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
I think I'll puke if I have to see one.

331
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
I haven't even gotten to the good stuff.

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
I don't know why that phrase, I think I'll puke.

333
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
It sounds like you just opted for something off a menu.

334
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,320
If I have to see one more canine anus winking back at me,

335
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,680
don't get me started on doggy nuts or lipsticks.

336
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
It's disgusting.

337
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
And I'm tired of being forced to see nude dogs everywhere,

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
should the government force dogs to dress in underwear.

339
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
I have a real problem with this,

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,200
that you didn't go with canis, canine anus.

341
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,040
That's clumsy, canis.

342
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,240
Also, I think that the three words canine anus winking

343
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
is maybe the worst sort of combination

344
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,960
that I've ever sort of experienced in all my time

345
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,160
with the English language.

346
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,840
But I am tired of seeing these butts and penises.

347
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,080
And it's a double standard.

348
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,000
And I do get it.

349
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
I do get it and approve of it and endorse it

350
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
and will petition it, I think.

351
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,080
How come them, not me?

352
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Justin, where do you stand vis-a-vis dog nuts?

353
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,120
I love the dog nuts, because that's hysterical.

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
What's he doing with those?

355
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,080
We've seen Van Wilder, yeah.

356
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,920
That's great, that's great.

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,280
But the butthole, are you kidding me with this thing?

358
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
That close to the ground?

359
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
And with those few brain cells?

360
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
I don't think so.

361
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,600
Maybe sell crazy elsewhere,

362
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,760
because we're all full up here, Mr. Dog.

363
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,560
Mm-hmm, maybe some kind of eye patch situation.

364
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh, that could be good.

365
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, you could get it right on the canus,

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,080
but leave the funny dog nuts out.

367
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,720
Yeah, I'd love to cover that lipstick up, though,

368
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,560
if we could find a way to cover the lipstick.

369
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
The nuts are so objectively funny.

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,960
It's like truck nuts, but on my best friend, whiskey dog.

371
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,600
Especially, you get them on a bulldog.

372
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh, that's funny.

373
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
So good, but we gotta cover that dick up, though.

374
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,980
Yuck.

375
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
So maybe like a pair of glasses,

376
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
where the dog nuts go in the nose part.

377
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,160
Kind of like a twofer thing that covers the lipstick

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,120
in the canus.

379
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
That's real good, that's real good.

380
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm gonna actually put an embargo on the word canus, Trav.

381
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,880
You're done with that one.

382
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,800
Sorry, bud.

383
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,760
But yeah, that'd be fun.

384
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Make it look like a Marx brother down there.

385
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,040
Yeah.

386
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,400
Yeah, cover it up.

387
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Cover it up, let's do it.

388
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,640
I think let's cover it up,

389
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,920
but unless it needs, I mean, if it needs to, it needs to.

390
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
That's what I know about dogs.

391
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
So cover it up, but with some kind of ripcord

392
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
that the dog can implement if it needs to.

393
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
With his mouth, he needs to be able to bite a cord

394
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
that exposes his butthole.

395
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
Then he can become incredibly powerful

396
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
and towel it like the rock when he holds a gun in the rundown.

397
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,920
When the dog needs an extra confidence boost,

398
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,720
he pulls the ripcord that exposes his anus,

399
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,040
and then he knows that he's the real king of town.

400
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
It is a one for one comparison

401
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,280
with rock holding a gun and a dog exposing its anus.

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
Now what if the rock-

403
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
You're not gonna give me this mortgage?

404
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,680
Well, hold on, check this out.

405
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,120
What if the rock also had a ripcord he could pull

406
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
that makes his bung-

407
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
Griffin, you don't think he does?

408
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,280
He's the rock.

409
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
He is very, very rich and powerful person.

410
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
That's what the people's eyebrow is connected to.

411
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,360
Oh, interesting.

412
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,040
So every time he does the people's eyebrow,

413
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,920
his bung tears his pants, and he says this is his butthole.

414
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,080
That's why they never did a reverse shot during WWE stuff.

415
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
Travis has a great point.

416
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
They didn't do that one.

417
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Yeah, you never see him from behind.

418
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
You just see his big, powerful front.

419
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,280
It's really interesting.

420
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
I've never really thought about it.

421
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,760
Boys, you're not gonna believe this.

422
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
Pretty much everybody on the comments here thinks this is bad.

423
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,760
Thinks it's a bad idea and that animals should be allowed to be nude

424
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
and that this is all human hangups.

425
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
But aren't we humans just animals?

426
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,040
I mean, a bung's a bung's a bung.

427
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,960
I've always said that.

428
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,360
And I'm sorry, do a bunch of Yahoo!

429
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
Answers people suddenly count more than us podcasters?

430
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,160
I think so.

431
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
I live with my two older brothers and their girlfriends.

432
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,360
Someone keeps putting our hand soap in the shower

433
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,720
despite there being an abundance of communal body wash.

434
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
It's a fancier bottle than what we usually buy,

435
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
so maybe they're confused.

436
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,080
But I've even circled hand soap in black marker.

437
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,560
It sounded like a delight.

438
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Does this person know what they're doing?

439
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
Should I let this happen?

440
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,200
Is there some way I could ask my roommates about their soap choices

441
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,760
without learning more about them than I could ever want to know?

442
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,520
That's from my brother, my brother, my hand soap and me in Michigan.

443
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
I thought that hand soap in the shower was really just sort of the,

444
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
that whole market was sort of run by like beach rental houses

445
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
where you roll up in their sad shower

446
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
and there's nothing inside of it

447
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
except for like a little bit of hand soap in a squeeze bottle.

448
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
And you're like, I guess this'll get me clean.

449
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
Thanks, Airbnb renters.

450
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
Yeah, this'll do, I guess.

451
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,040
I guess here's the thing, question asker.

452
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,560
If it cleans the skin on your hands,

453
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,000
it probably does the rest of your body too, right?

454
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,200
It's not like it's perfectly suited just for your hand skin.

455
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
This is what, at 442?

456
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
441, 442?

457
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
I think it's 442.

458
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,000
That means it's been 441 episodes since we have talked about whether,

459
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,200
you know, sudsy shower liquids are effectively interchangeable.

460
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,440
Yes.

461
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
And I don't know if y'all's position have changed.

462
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,160
I think that the hand soap is gonna get you there,

463
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,800
but I also think hand soap to, you know, a big thing of body wash,

464
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
you are paying more per ounce with the hand soap.

465
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
So like from a monetary perspective, I get it.

466
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
But I mean, it's all sudsy bubble stuff.

467
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
You can use that shit anywhere.

468
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,560
What about dish soap?

469
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,520
Now we're into it.

470
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,800
Now we're in here.

471
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,120
Because apparently like one drop of Dawn

472
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,480
is enough to do a whole sinkload of dishes.

473
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,880
Yeah.

474
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,360
Yeah.

475
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,280
So I feel like three drops of Dawn would do a whole sinkload of Travis.

476
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
And with my porcelain China doll skin,

477
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
it's gonna get me there, I think.

478
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
Man, Trav.

479
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,800
Can we talk about something for a second?

480
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah.

481
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,320
Yeah.

482
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Travis just said a drop of Dawn would wash a sink full of dishes.

483
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm sitting here and I'm telling you guys,

484
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm realizing now I don't know how to wash dishes by the sink full.

485
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,400
I don't even know.

486
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,560
I couldn't soak dishes in the sink if I wanted to.

487
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,040
I don't know how to do that.

488
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,840
I have the little stick that's full of soap and a sponge on the end

489
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
that I wash the dishes with.

490
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,560
I don't know how to do that.

491
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,680
Do you guys know how to do that?

492
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
How to wash dishes?

493
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
How to wash dishes, bud?

494
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
No.

495
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,840
Like a sink.

496
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
If you want to wash a sink full of dishes, right?

497
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Where it's like the sink is full of water and soap

498
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,840
and they're soaking and then you're loving it.

499
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,080
Yeah.

500
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,640
Do you know how to...

501
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,840
Would you know how to...

502
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
I would have to upturn...

503
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,800
I think I'd have to upturn a small plate to cover the drain of the sink.

504
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,000
Is that what people were doing?

505
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,240
Oh my goodness gracious.

506
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
Oh my God, Justin.

507
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,280
Justin, you have two human children that you take care of.

508
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,400
Yeah, I've done the plate thing before.

509
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
Is there another way that people are washing dishes by the sink full?

510
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
I mean, Justin also has Archibald who does most of this stuff.

511
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,320
Yes, that's true.

512
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
He handles most of this stuff for him.

513
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
Justin's trained orangutan.

514
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,120
Oh, and the girls just love Archibald playing.

515
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh, yeah.

516
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,880
Oh, yeah.

517
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,360
He can get...

518
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,720
And so do the ladies.

519
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah, the ladies love him.

520
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,960
Ladies love cool Archibald.

521
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,000
He gets, you know, he gets pretty strong and angry sometimes.

522
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Oh, yeah.

523
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,840
Hey guys, don't get so distracted by this great new character

524
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
that you forget to dunk on me.

525
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,760
We were trying to save you because you're our brother and we love you.

526
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,560
Yeah, it's bizarre, dude.

527
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,880
I don't know what would I...

528
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
I do dishes every week.

529
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
Okay, how?

530
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,160
By fucking...

531
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
What are you talking about?

532
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,160
By getting them wet and soapy and then scrubbing them with a sponge

533
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,560
and then rinsing them off and then putting them in a dryer.

534
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
What the fuck are you talking about?

535
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,320
I don't have...

536
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,120
The same way human beings have kept water from running out of a thing forever.

537
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,840
It's not fucking active.

538
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
You have access to an Amazon account.

539
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Have not had a plug for a decade and I'm doing fine.

540
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm doing fine.

541
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,640
Justin Celesta, if you can hear me, order Sink Drain Plug from Amazon now.

542
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
It's not fucking plutonium juice.

543
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,040
You don't have to handle it special.

544
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,760
You wash it like you would wash a car, a child.

545
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Hey, let me ask you guys a question.

546
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,080
Yes.

547
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,800
A big bottle of bubble liquid that you would use to blow bubbles for a child to enjoy?

548
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,480
You think you can get clean with that shit?

549
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,600
Well, it's got glycerin in there.

550
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,800
Yeah.

551
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,760
So you can get slippery.

552
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
You want to get slippery.

553
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,720
Maybe some people like that.

554
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
If you go down a slipping slide covered in dish soap, is that like a shower?

555
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,760
I think that'll get...

556
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,080
Yep.

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,120
Most stuff's like a shower if you really think about it.

558
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,760
I made a mess.

559
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,560
So things are like showers and poetry so far if I'm keeping track.

560
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,560
I did a mess up as I bought some shampoo to replace my last shampoo plus conditioner,

561
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,360
obviously.

562
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm not going to do that twice.

563
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,000
I bought some shampoo plus conditioner to replace my old shampoo plus conditioner.

564
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,480
And then today, when I was looking at my body wash, I noticed on the label, it said,

565
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,960
also, it's also shampoo.

566
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
I don't know how they put it.

567
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,560
I think they had like a more professional way of putting it.

568
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,280
But it's like, this is also shampoo in here.

569
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,160
And then I had to look at that new bottle and just be kind of sad because it's like,

570
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,680
I'm never, ever going to use you.

571
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,280
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

572
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,320
If I could have one all just in cleaning liquid, of course I'm going to do that.

573
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,520
Well, can we, oh, this is like the good, the special good burger sauce.

574
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,200
What if we mix together some of your good body wash, some really good smelling stuff.

575
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,960
And I'm talking about splurging for some Axe shit.

576
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,760
The real deal, Holyfield good smelling good stuff like Axe.

577
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,800
And then you put a little bit of, you know, Pantene Pro-V conditioner for, you know,

578
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,120
severely dry damaged hair and you mix that cream in and then if you want a little bit

579
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,000
of shampoo in there, maybe a little herbal essences.

580
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,080
So you can, like in the commercials, have a cum while doing the shower.

581
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
I think this is great.

582
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,040
And it can be your all-in-one special shower stuff.

583
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,880
Gets you clean, gets you conditioned, gets your cum out.

584
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,680
Get your cum out.

585
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
Get clean inside and out.

586
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,120
Get it clean going on the hair, the body, and get you a cum out.

587
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,360
I'm a child because I'll always laugh at the phrase, get your cum out.

588
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,880
I mean, it's new.

589
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
You don't have to be ashamed of that.

590
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,480
Yeah, and I don't think a child, if a child laughed at that, I would be very perturbed.

591
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
It's a bold new idea in comedy.

592
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,080
Like we can't just, can't just write it off that quickly.

593
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
Uh, should we go to the money zone, I think?

594
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:07,840
Yeah, I'd love that.

595
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,320
Uh, folks, our first sponsor this week is Casper.

596
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
Ah, speaking of getting a cum out, right?

597
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,040
I-

598
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,680
Wait, what?

599
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,560

Yes.

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520

That's too confusing for me.

628
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,000
I don't know how to say it.

629
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600

So Juice, you do that.

Very professional.

640
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,320
Very professional.

641
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Very good thing to do.

642
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm sure Squarespace appreciates it.

643
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,040

Dead Pilot Society brings you exclusive readings of comedy pilots that were never made featuring

656
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,320
actors like Patton Oswalt.

657
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,000
So the vampire from the future sleeps in the dude's studio during the day and they hunt

658
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,720
monsters at night.

659
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880

Come on, Cory.

662
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,160
She's too serious, too business-y.

663
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
She doesn't know the hokey pokey.

664
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
She'll learn what it's all about.

665
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,840
Busy Phillips and Dave Koechner.

666
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,120
Baby, this is family.

667
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,920
My uncle, Tell, who showed his wiener to Cinderella at Disneyland is family.

668
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,520
Do you want him staying with us?

669
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,760
He did stay with us for three months.

670
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,360
And he was a delight.

671
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,880
A new pilot every month only on Dead Pilot Society for maximum fun.

672
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,600
Well, I am extremely excited right now because we have been joined here in the My Brother,

673
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,360
My Brother, Me chuckle pit by none other than Bridget Lancaster.

674
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,080
She's one of the hosts of America's Test Kitchen.

675
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
She's been with the show since it launched.

676
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,800
She is the host of America's Test Kitchen's new show, podcast, in this case called Proof.

677
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,640
And she is also on this podcast, My Brother, My Brother, Me.

678
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,960
So it may seem like a contradiction, but I assure you she is present.

679
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,840
Her name is Bridget Lancaster and she is here with us.

680
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,960
Bridget Lancaster, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

681
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,280
I can't even believe I'm here.

682
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,840
I mean, this is like a West Virginia homecoming.

683
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
It kind of is.

684
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,800
I learned this that you grew up in Cross Lanes.

685
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Is that correct?

686
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,880
I sure did.

687
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,360
Yeah.

688
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,760
And I worked at the Huntington Mall, believe it or not.

689
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,280
Get out of town.

690
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,400
Wait, where at?

691
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,040
As a chef, I have to imagine it was Olive Garden.

692
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
Were you at the Big Loafer?

693
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
It wasn't even food.

694
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,680
I was at the Benetton.

695
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah.

696
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
High end folks here.

697
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,000
Wait, Griffin, did you ever work at the Huntington Mall?

698
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,480
Because if so, that would be all four of us.

699
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,280
Unfortunately, no.

700
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,360
I think I'm the only one who escaped its clutches.

701
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,920
No.

702
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,600
See, I worked at the Best Buy.

703
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,920
Justin, I believe you were at both the Olive Garden and the Babbage's.

704
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,800
Is that correct?

705
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,640
I was at the Olive Garden, the Babbage's, the Best Buy, the Toys R Us.

706
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
He was all over that mall.

707
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,360
Yeah, and the Olive Garden.

708
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,840
I worked at five different mall area places.

709
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,320
But now I work at America's Test Kitchen.

710
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,800
Nope.

711
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,120
That's-

712
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
What?

713
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,480
That's Bridget, actually.

714
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,980
You do.

715
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,500
Anyway, no.

716
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,180
So tell me, this new podcast, Proof, is it a podcast adaptation of the Gwyneth Paltrow,

717
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,980
Anthony Hopkins movie, Proof?

718
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,540
You nailed it.

719
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,940
That joke's not going anywhere.

720
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,980
It's probably exactly the opposite of that, I would say.

721
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,580
As close as it would get to Anthony Hopkins or Sir Anthony Hopkins, right,

722
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,020
would be maybe we would do an episode on do fava beans and Chianti actually go together.

723
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,780
Oh, okay.

724
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,620
Hey, did you know that the guy who directed that movie, as well as Shakespeare in Love

725
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,300
and the Best Exotic Mirror Gold Hotel, his name is John Madden?

726
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,340
That doesn't seem right.

727
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,620
That doesn't seem like it should be allowed.

728
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,340
John Madden?

729
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,740
It's the same guy.

730
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,220
He's a huge football man, I guess.

731
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,460
We have a lot of questions from listeners about food and cooking.

732
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,540
I want to ask one, though, before we get started.

733
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:33,380
Bridget, what food are you most embarrassed about very much enjoying?

734
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,620
Just like, what kind of garbage do you really get down on?

735
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,180
God, that list is long.

736
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,620
I mean, it is really long.

737
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,420
I love John food.

738
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,780
Yeah, but don't pull out one.

739
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,220
Bridget, I don't want you to pull out one that makes you sound like a woman of the people.

740
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,700
You know, like, I don't want a populist choice here.

741
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,460
I want something nasty.

742
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,300
Yeah, I don't want like potato chips.

743
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,260
Yeah, I was like, no, no, no.

744
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,980
Something gross.

745
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,940
Yeah, no way.

746
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,540
All right, I got one.

747
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,500
Yeah, I got one.

748
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,780
Although, you know, I'm saying it doesn't sound gross to me, which is why I eat it.

749
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,780
But I love microwaved bologna.

750
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,700
What in the world?

751
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,100
I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.

752
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,620
I assume you mean bologna that you microwave, not like a freeze-dried thing.

753
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,740
Don't eat that bologna you haven't microwaved it yet.

754
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,580
Okay, so I got to tell you why.

755
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,380
And I guess you could do it on the stovetop too, but I'm just really impatient.

756
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,060
So you take a slice of bologna and you got to cut these little release cuts around it.

757
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,700
Otherwise, it'll cup up as it cooks.

758
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,220
Some people like the cup because it captures all the bologna sweat right there.

759
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,940
You're talking about like fried bologna.

760
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,460
It's basically fried bologna.

761
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,980
And then I talk about cheese.

762
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,180
And then as it cooks, it turns into, it's basically a hot dog and cheese in flat form.

763
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,660
I know.

764
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,020
Oh, my goodness.

765
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,420
You have just given me the strongest sense memory that one time I remember spending the

766
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,460
night at my friend Chris's house when I was like 10 and he microwaved a slice of bologna

767
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,340
and put like pizza sauce and mozzarella on it and like served it to me like bologna pizza.

768
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,980
I thought this would be like a fun food segment where I would learn about great foods.

769
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,060
And now I never want to eat ever again.

770
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,540
I want to go buy a lifetime supply of Soylent and just kind of give the rest of it up.

771
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Oh, come on.

772
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,780
I would hate that I disillusioned you a little bit.

773
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,380
It has been a while since I've had my microwave bologna treat.

774
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,660
Bridget, to be fair, with a grooving stomach, it would probably be better if we stopped

775
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,620
eating solid food.

776
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,220
Well, that would be maybe pureed bologna would be the next.

777
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,340
Yes, now we're talking.

778
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,940
Now you're cooking.

779
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
You culinary expert, you.

780
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,380
That's perfect.

781
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Okay, I have to ask a question.

782
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,580
That's the law.

783
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,740
I am obsessed with cheese platters.

784
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,660
Whenever I see one on a menu at a restaurant, I try to order it.

785
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,460
Unfortunately, they're often very expensive and contain very small samples of cheese.

786
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,100
I've tried to recreate the magic at home, but it's just not the same.

787
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,660
How can I recreate a restaurant worthy cheese platter at home without breaking the bank?

788
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
That's from cheese obsessed in Vermont.

789
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,100
Well, they could just walk right outside there in Vermont.

790
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,740
I mean, cheese hangs from the trees up there.

791
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
Yes, that explains everything.

792
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,940
Yeah, well, okay.

793
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,140
So I think a good cheese platter has to have three kinds of cheese.

794
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,940
Usually there's a cheddar involved, a nice sharp cheddar, and then a blue.

795
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,900
Neither cheddar nor blue has to be very expensive.

796
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,020
You can get pretty good blue.

797
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,780
The third one is where I feel like you can kind of go off the rails and get really fancy

798
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,100
if you want.

799
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,500
You can have an aged goat cheese or something tangy.

800
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,860
Something to offset the funk of the blue and the sharpness of the cheddar.

801
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,460
But I mean, you know, three cheeses, that's all you need, three cheese.

802
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,140
And the third cheese you're saying is the wild.

803
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,420
The other two cheeses, Locke, you know they're going to be good.

804
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,900
Yes.

805
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,700
The third cheese, you can get something challenging.

806
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,340
That's where your personality shows through.

807
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,900
You know what I mean?

808
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,980
That's where it's like, oh yeah, Doug, Doug only does cheese with M&Ms in it.

809
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,780
That guy, when he does the cheese slate.

810
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,420
Right, you know you're going to get Gouda with Doug.

811
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,100
And he's going to make a joke about it and say like, as Gouda as it gets or whatever,

812
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,980
that's Doug.

813
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,540
And then you get to say, I can't even bear it any longer.

814
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,820
Oh my God.

815
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,100
Yowza, Yowza.

816
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,820
Downtown.

817
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,780
Yowza Machi.

818
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,220
So like, if you also, if you don't want to leave the house, you can usually just make

819
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,660
one out of stuff you got lying around.

820
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,380
You could do one with like shredded cheese and then some cream, like a big mound of cream cheese.

821
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,940
Cheetos.

822
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,740
And some Cheetos that you just have there.

823
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,660
Yeah, crushed Cheez-Its.

824
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,940
I would probably do like, my cheddar and blue would be cheap and bad.

825
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,300
And then my third powerful cheese, I would get something incredibly, incredibly powerful

826
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,540
because no one's going to remember the other two anyway.

827
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,020
Because my third cheese is so, so important.

828
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,860
Like a gold cheese.

829
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,820
Eating a hateful cheese that you know is going to be quite bad, it's a really great way of

830
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,620
becoming the monster here in 2019, I feel like.

831
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,780
That would be the best name for a cheese shop.

832
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,820
The hateful cheese.

833
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,860
The hateful cheese.

834
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,260
That's why people put that stinky blue on there, right?

835
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,020
Like that's the challenge cheese.

836
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,220
That's the cheese of like, we know you're not going to finish that one.

837
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,780
Nobody wants that.

838
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,260
Oh yeah.

839
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,100
No, if it smells like a foot, you know, people are just going to start walking away.

840
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,580
Hey, we talk about charcuterie a lot, including actually I think later in this episode, which

841
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
we recorded before this bit, which is strange.

842
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,180
But are you supposed to stack it all up like a sandwich and go for it that way?

843
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,500
Or are you really supposed to enjoy each thing one at a time?

844
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,860
You can do whatever you want.

845
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,180
You could stack it all up Scooby Doo style if you want.

846
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,340
Or just take a big, you know, hammer to it and mash it all into one big lump.

847
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,460
Oh, now we're talking.

848
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,940
Okay, now Bridget, you're an expert.

849
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,460
You cannot tell people that because they were going to have people going off smash

850
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,340
their charcuterie with hammers and say, it's okay, Bridget says, fried.

851
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,460
I have a video of that.

852
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,020
I went to a really bougie place recently in Vegas where the dude like had like a whole

853
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,460
cheese cart and he asked us some questions like, I don't know, sommelier, which I also

854
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,140
think is BS, but he asked us some questions and then he said, okay, I think these are

855
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,900
the three cheeses for you.

856
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,940
Oh, no.

857
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,980
That's not real, right?

858
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,860
He just had three cheeses in mind he was already going to give us because those are the cheeses

859
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,420
he had thought of.

860
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,940
He had three cheeses in his pocket.

861
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,580
Yeah.

862
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,340
I don't understand these places because they make you automatically feel like you're not

863
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,940
good enough for their cheese.

864
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,340
I'm not.

865
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,060
To be fair, I wasn't.

866
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,300
And I'm not saying, I want to say, the knowledge of wine isn't bunk.

867
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,540
It's the idea of saying this wine is better than this wine because of notes of-

868
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,580
Own it, Travis.

869
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:48,980
Own it.

870
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,780
You hate wine.

871
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,900
You hate wine people.

872
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,580
I think Bridget's gonna agree with me here.

873
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,020
The big problem with the cheese plate is how all the cheese on it is raw.

874
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:04,260
I've been pretty firm on my sense that raw cheese is inedible and it should always be

875
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,500
melted into a dip or pizza topping.

876
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,940
Do you feel pretty much that same way as me, Bridget?

877
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,420
I will say that slightly warmed cheese tastes a lot better than cold cheese just put right

878
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,740
out there.

879
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,140
She is meeting you halfway.

880
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,660
That is such a generous response.

881
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,700
I'm just going to accept it.

882
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,660
I recently started living alone and my cooking skills aren't that great.

883
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,420
I also don't have a lot of time to cook.

884
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,940
What are foods that last a long time in the fridge that I can make multiple meals out

885
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,660
of during the week?

886
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,420
Oh, boy.

887
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,580
Well, I would say, well, depending on if they have any limitations, if they like meat or

888
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:49,940
anything like that, I would say that cooking a big batch of beans and rice and then you

889
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,740
can keep pulling from it and adding a little bit of chicken or steak or chopped vegetables,

890
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,780
things like that.

891
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,460
So I think if you have like what I do at home, I do a cook day.

892
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,540
I have a couple of big cook days where I'll cook a big batch of something and

893
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,700
I'll keep that for leftovers for my kids and stuff.

894
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,420
And so I don't have to start from ground zero every single time for like beans and

895
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,380
things like that.

896
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,340
I would also...

897
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,140
Hi, I'm Travis.

898
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,900
I'm the other food expert on this podcast.

899
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,620
Suvi is...

900
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,220
Griffin got me into it.

901
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,620
Oh, I've been wondering when we were going to get into this.

902
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,140
You don't have to know anything.

903
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:30,420
And like you throw that bag into some water with the Suvi magic wand going and then you

904
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,220
walk away and you can come back like three, four, 24 hour, whatever, hours later and it's

905
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,940
done.

906
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,700
It's kind of amazing, isn't it?

907
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,340
I love this.

908
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,380
I love this meat bath.

909
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,020
I was so excited.

910
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,700
I got one for Justin a couple of years ago.

911
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,820
I got one for Travis.

912
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,860
Justin, why don't you chime in?

913
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,060
What have you been Suvi-ing, babe?

914
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,620
What you got going on in that meat bath?

915
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,100
That I got you as a gift that I thought you'd love like two years ago?

916
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,140
Is this a real Suvi thing or are you guys just in a jacuzzi right now?

917
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:01,860
No, Griffin really did get me a Suvi thing that really is still in the pantry unopened.

918
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,460
But Griffin, I feel like it's going to be soon, bud.

919
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,620
I just have been waiting for a real special time for me and my family.

920
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,900
Haven't I balanced it out enough by literally using it every day for the last three weeks?

921
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,860
Yeah, I mean, you're a good one.

922
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,500
You're a good one.

923
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,980
Thank you.

924
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,060
Let's see.

925
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,420
For my birthday, my friend bought me a very fancy chef's knife, something I've wanted

926
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,700
for quite some time.

927
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,540
But as I started cooking meal for myself and my partner, I couldn't bring myself to remove

928
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,340
this beautiful blade from its cardboard packaging.

929
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,020
It looks so pristine and perfect.

930
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,220
It seems a shame to use it for something as mundane as chopping tomatoes.

931
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,860
I use my old nasty chef's knives to prepare the meal instead.

932
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,220
But now I'm afraid of never using this wonderful blade I've been gifted.

933
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,020
Help!

934
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,980
How do I break in my new knife in an appropriate way?

935
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,020
Or should I just get it over with and chop the ding-dang mushrooms?

936
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,660
That's from scared of slicing in Sacramento.

937
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,100
I love that question.

938
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,900
It's so good.

939
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,300
That actually happens with whole kitchens.

940
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,860
People renovate their kitchen and then they don't cook at all because they don't want

941
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,740
to mess it up.

942
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,620
And I get that.

943
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,380
But I'd say any great meal would be worth using that knife.

944
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,660
And I tell you what, anything that you use a just right out of the package knife on is

945
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,740
going to make it feel like a million dollar ingredient because it's just going to slide

946
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,700
right through it.

947
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,620
For Christmas, Justin got me a knife block that is a magnetic, like, spinning 360, like,

948
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,500
wooden knife block that I believe-

949
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,180
Did I get that knife block because it was the number one most recommended knife block

950
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,580
by America's Test Kitchen chosen as the best knife block?

951
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,460
Indeed I did.

952
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,260
Yes, that is accurate.

953
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,380
And I find that that also makes me use my knives way more often because one, they're

954
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,220
visible, so I think to use them.

955
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,660
But two, magnets are basically magic.

956
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,740
And, like, I can kind of, from across the room, throw the knife at the block and it

957
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,780
sticks to it.

958
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,380
Oh, that's the best.

959
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,020
Every time I watch Kill Bill and Hattori Hanzo does that in the kitchen, he, like, throws

960
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,860
the knife and it gets caught in the net.

961
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,860
And that's appropriate because whenever I get my knife sharpened at the farmer's market

962
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,460
and I bring it home, I'm very much in this person's shoes where I'm like, this is Hattori

963
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,660
Hanzo's steel.

964
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,940
It's now ornamental.

965
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,540
It now has sentimental value.

966
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,980
I cannot risk dulling this beautiful blade.

967
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,420
Oh, you have to.

968
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,460
You absolutely have to.

969
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,260
I mean, using a dull blade is the worst thing you can do.

970
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,020
It's just going to skip right off the food and it's going to find your finger every single

971
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,520
time.

972
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
Well, now I never want to cook again.

973
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,980
Should I wear chainmail gloves?

974
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,620
Is that a thing?

975
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,500
My friend got one of those because he used to run the slicer at Arby's.

976
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,900
So my friend had one that we use for cooking all the time because there is little more

977
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,980
empowering than cooking with a chainmail glove because it's like, I don't care.

978
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,100
I'll do whatever I want.

979
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,700
Cut where I want, how I want.

980
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,380
It is literally medieval, right?

981
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,180
It puts you back and you want these giant turkey legs.

982
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,180
They use them a lot for shucking oysters up here, the chainmail gloves and things like

983
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,980
that.

984
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,140
I would worry that I'd be like, well, I've already got the glove.

985
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,260
I should just go ahead and buy a full chainmail suit of armor.

986
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,340
Why would that worry you?

987
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Yeah, that would be kind of amazing.

988
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,140
I've been watching a lot of Marie Kondo and I don't think she'd be so down on me owning

989
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,900
a whole set of chainmail armor.

990
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,260
I think it would spark me a little bit of joy right now, but then very quickly it would

991
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,300
just be a lot of armor.

992
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,980
But it probably folds into nothing.

993
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,700
That might be a good point, yeah.

994
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,540
And you know, when the shit hits the fan, I'll be the one wearing chainmail.

995
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,420
That's true.

996
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,700
And she won't be.

997
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,820
She'll be like, where's all my-

998
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,060
And then finally you can fight Marie Kondo.

999
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,980
She'll be like, where's my weapons and armor?

1000
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,660
That's right, I threw them all away.

1001
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,820
And chainmail is a great scrubber for really dirty pots and pans.

1002
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,620
See?

1003
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,340
For sure.

1004
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,860
So you can just rub them on your body.

1005
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,660
Yeah.

1006
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,340
You're like an all-in-one cooking robot.

1007
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,180
Get all the gristle off.

1008
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,660
It's like the third thing I need a video for, you know.

1009
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Bridget Lancaster, thank you so much for joining us on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1010

Where can people find your work, your body of work, if you will?

1011
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:03,860
Wow.

1012
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,140

Thank you so much for being here, Bridget.

1019
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,420
And let's get back to the rest of the program.

1020
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,580
Hey, do you boys want a Yahoo?

1021
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,420
I do, thank you.

1022
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,420
I mean, I've got one here that was sent in by Elliot.

1023
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,900
Thanks, Elliot.

1024
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,780
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to name.

1025
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,660
Percy asks, why don't they make an electric eye that moves and watches you and is like

1026
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,500
Google Home or Amazon Echo?

1027
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,780
Huh.

1028
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,020
Why don't they make a device like Google Home or Amazon Echo, but that is an eyeball and

1029
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,100
eyelids on a moving pole that watches you and follows its eyes on you everywhere you

1030
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,580
go.

1031
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,780
It blinks and it talks and it scans you and tells you what it thinks you need, like clothing

1032
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,740
or something like that.

1033
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,220
Can you fucking imagine if the eye in your house blinked at you and was like, you need

1034
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:07,780
a new shirt?

1035
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,940
Do you want me to talk to the little cylinder guy you got in the kitchen and make it get

1036
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,820
you a new shirt?

1037
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,620
Because I can do that.

1038
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,900
That's what you're wearing today?

1039
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1040
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,100
I'm going to order you some shoes.

1041
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,620
It is.

1042
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:30,180
I can see what they're kind of saying, because if you think about it in like an iRobot sense,

1043
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,780
you've basically just created like ears that lay on your counter, and I guess a mouth.

1044
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,100
Right.

1045
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,540
So like ears and mouth that lay on your counter, but like they desperately want to get up

1046
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,220
and look at you and follow you around the house and kill you and help you make breakfast

1047
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,980
and take you to high school.

1048
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,860
And say catty things about the clothes you're wearing and murder you, and yeah, for sure.

1049
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,500
Or you're like, oh, you know, whatever we want to call it, like, I got to think of a

1050
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,580
name that's not one of my go-to comedy names.

1051
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,900
Got it.

1052
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,620
Sugarman.

1053
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,740
Okay, go Sugarman.

1054
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:02,980
Yes.

1055
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,660
You say, Sugarman, order me, you know, another Whitman sampler.

1056
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,420
And Sugarman's like, no.

1057
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,100
And you're like, what?

1058
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,900
And you're like, you still have half a Whitman sampler left.

1059
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,180
I can see it in the counter.

1060
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,380
I can see it right there.

1061
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,780
When you finish that one, I'll order you another one, because you know if I get you another

1062
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,980
one, you're going to open that one up and you're immediately going to eat all the toffees

1063
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,420
and then leave half of it again.

1064
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,420
And I'm not going through this again with you, Travis.

1065
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,420
Now, let's talk about those jeans.

1066
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,620
What in the world?

1067
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,180
Are those jinkos?

1068
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,340
Well, actually, that might be back.

1069
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,900
Yeah, maybe it could just be Carson Kressley up there, like his eye.

1070
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,700
The queer eye.

1071
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,940
The queer eye floating in the air telling you these things.

1072
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,580
That could be good.

1073
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,420
So I took some stool softeners about an hour ago for personal reasons.

1074
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,780
And if I don't get up and address the effects of those right now, I'm going to blast off

1075
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,500
like Team Rocket.

1076
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,300
I'm so sorry, guys.

1077
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,740
So should Jessalyn and I just pick up your- oh, he's gone.

1078
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,900
So we'll just keep doing the show, I guess.

1079
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,060
Here's some other- hey, Travis, I know something we could talk about where Griffin's gone.

1080
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,020
Okay.

1081
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,700
Because I don't want to waste his time with you.

1082
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:10,740
Okay.

1083
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:18,820
Do you- if you had- obviously you said Sugarman, but really though, if you had an Android at

1084
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:27,940
your house, what celebrity would you most want its personality to embody?

1085
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,700
Oh, see, that's tough, Justin, because my first thought was to go with Oscar Isaac,

1086
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,300
who is the celebrity I most want to hang out with.

1087
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,700
Sure.

1088
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,020
And ask him about his time in a ska band in the early 2000s.

1089
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,660
Okay.

1090
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,620
But you got to pick somebody who-

1091
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,100
Yes.

1092
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,940
Like, they're going to do- like, they're not annoying for them to be there.

1093
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,540
It's not weird that they're there.

1094
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,420
But also, you're not so distracted by like, is that Chris Hemsworth?

1095
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,060
You know what I mean?

1096
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,700
Right.

1097
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,140
So do you have an answer for me, or where- so where are you at on this?

1098
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,660
I'm going to say...

1099
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,100
Dulé Hill.

1100
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,980
Dulé Hill!

1101
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,140
Yeah, I think that that would be like an easy, chill dude to hang out with.

1102
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,860
I was going to say Timothy Amundson, but I think I was just stuck, because I also thought

1103
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,740
James Roday.

1104
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,660
So basically, I just cycled through different actors from Psych.

1105
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,700
Right.

1106
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,860
I could also see Maggie Lawson.

1107
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,620
So basically, anyone-

1108
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,180
From Psych.

1109
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,140
Of the Psych.

1110
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,420
Anyone from Psych.

1111
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,060
Basically, anybody-

1112
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,420
Corbin Bernsen, maybe?

1113
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,780
I don't know much about him.

1114
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,900
I would like a- see, here's- doing him- I think mine would probably be John Larroquette.

1115
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:39,940
Because I feel-

1116
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,140
Wait, are you guys still going?

1117
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,180
That would be classy.

1118
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,980
Yeah.

1119
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,260
Wait, are you guys still going?

1120
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:50,100
Yeah, we were just talking about if we had a robot butler, what celebrity personality-

1121
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,020
Well, now this is- but if you guys kept doing stuff without me here, I am going to have

1122
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,060
to leave in the part where I explain that I took stool softeners and had to go.

1123
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,500
Yeah, exactly.

1124
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,060
So we got-

1125
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,460
Yeah, it was a good part-

1126
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,340
Justin said he didn't know how to plug up his sink, and you don't know how to plug up

1127
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,900
your bow.

1128
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,660
Yeah, it's all the same.

1129
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,300
Griffin, if you had a sle- I just said John Larroquette.

1130
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:15,860
Because I feel like kind of catty, definitely loves loyalty, but can be a little bit catty

1131
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:21,860
with people, but also hard worker, smartest guy in the room, would love that as my robot

1132
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:21,860
butler.

1133
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,980
And I said anyone from the cast of Psych.

1134
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,380
Yeah.

1135
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,580
Yeah, okay.

1136
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,380
So are we talking about robot butler, or are we still talking about the I?

1137
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,340
Because if it's a robot butler-

1138
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,140
It's both!

1139
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,180
Well, no, it's not, Trav.

1140
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,900
It's an android that lives in your house, and what celebrity

1141
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,500
personality would you most want them to have?

1142
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,100
It would change for me.

1143
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,740
If it's a robot butler with a robot bod, it would probably be Rosie O'Donnell, just

1144
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,500
because it would make me laugh all the time.

1145
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,500
And the other, if it was just an I floating above me, though, I would want something a

1146
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,820
bit more ominous, like a Tilda Swinton.

1147
00:51:52,820 --> 00:52:00,900
If there was a Tilda Swinton telling me that I don't need more syrup, I have four bottles

1148
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:07,220
of syrup, stop buying syrup every time I go to the store, or also that my jeans are wack.

1149
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,820
I want that to be a stern Tilda.

1150
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,820
If we're talking about a floating I, I would want that to be more someone I'd be afraid

1151
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,620
to disappoint.

1152
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,420
So I would say a Bradley Whitford.

1153
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, yeah.

1154
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,220
No, I would say Toby Ziegler would be the one that I would most not want to disappoint.

1155
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,100
No way.

1156
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,780
Yeah, get a Schiff up there.

1157
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,420
Get Schiff in the picture.

1158
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,940
Get Schiff in the mix, all right.

1159
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,980
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1160
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,740
Steven Weber, final answer.

1161
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,260
Steve, Justin, Travis goes hard for Steve, stands for Steve.

1162
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,220
Steven Weber is good.

1163
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,460
Steven Weber, final answer.

1164
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,500
We should be clear.

1165
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,020
We are talking about if you could sort of copy and paste the personality of that person

1166
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,540
so they would be around you all the time.

1167
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,220
You're not talking about literally sort of, you know, uploading Steven Weber's actual

1168
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,020
consciousness sort of, you know, Black Mirror style.

1169
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:00,180
Putting him in a jar like Brock Tune.

1170
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,140
Like Brock Tune.

1171
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,340
Anyway, here's another question I got.

1172
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,780
I work for an insurance company.

1173
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,060
Our corporate campus has several buildings serviced by an access road that feeds out

1174
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,260
to the main strip.

1175
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,020
The grounds are nicely landscaped, including a big pond near the entrance.

1176
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,140
Problem is, this has attracted a big flock of geese that wander the grounds.

1177
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,820
Sometimes they'll just walk out on the access road and cause traffic jams.

1178
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,740
The most heinous thing I saw were a gaggle of geese standing in front of the access road

1179
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,500
where it meets the main road, and seven cars backed up waiting for them to move.

1180
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
You couldn't even go around them because of the median.

1181
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,740
I've yet to be trapped by them, but I don't know its only amount of time until they make

1182
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,860
me late for work.

1183
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,300
What can I do to get rid of these geese without hurting them?

1184
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,020
That's from my Gooses Cooked in Massachusetts.

1185
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:52,100
I guess what we're dealing with here is life finds a way.

1186
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,060
Okay, sure.

1187
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,020
All right, I'll allow it.

1188
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,220
Go on.

1189
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:04,340
We tried to take the land from the geese, and now the geese are taking the land back.

1190
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,060
It's not bad.

1191
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:13,460
I mean, man creates goose, goose delays man, god kills man, goose kills god.

1192
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,380
Eats god.

1193
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,740
Goose eats god, women rule the world.

1194
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,900
Food for thought.

1195
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,460
Hey, hey, is it possible the insurance company you work for is Aflac?

1196
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:35,780
These geese are here by design because the Aflac duck needs to fuck, and so they bring in-

1197
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,060
And as we all know, ducks love to fuck geese.

1198
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,380
And that is also Aflac's second motto.

1199
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,100
It's the Aflac motto is 15% or more of 15 or whatever.

1200
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,020
No, that's Geico, but they have a motto.

1201
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,380
The other one is the Aflac duck gots to fuck.

1202
00:54:54,020 --> 00:55:00,260
The Aflac duck, a cross-species breeder that is an abject horror to god himself.

1203
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,500
A duck and a goose.

1204
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,340
A goose is just a pretty duck.

1205
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:04,900
I don't know why-

1206
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,940
It would make Griffin, it would make a guck, and I'm not a fan of this portmanteau.

1207
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:11,460
No.

1208
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,900
Or a deuce.

1209
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,420
It's not good either.

1210
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,060
Deuce guck.

1211
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,420
Deuce guck, male gigolo.

1212
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,620
You monster!

1213
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,220
Deuce guck.

1214
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:31,540
Rob is back, and this time he's playing a half duck, half goose monstrous hybrid who is here

1215
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,660
for your sexual needs.

1216
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,380
He's deuce guck, guck gigolo.

1217
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,140
I just think that if that happens, you've got a bill-

1218
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,420
Okay, let's not get rid of the geese, all right?

1219
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,060
Yeah.

1220
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,380
Let's leave the geese and then be late for work whenever the fuck you want to.

1221
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,500
It's so good.

1222
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,620
It's so good.

1223
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,860
Like you could just plan on leaving your house like 15 minutes late and there's like the geese.

1224
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,740
The geese again.

1225
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:04,980
And then eventually they'll round up all the geese and they'll send them to a real nice

1226
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,420
geese farm upstate.

1227
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,900
Real nice, fellow employees.

1228
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,820
No, Justin, you're suggesting-

1229
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,780
Real nice.

1230
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:17,460
Yeah, you're suggesting that these people who are going to send them upstate are somehow

1231
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,580
able to collect all geese.

1232
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:26,180
I'm saying that if it starts cutting into employee productivity, corporate America will

1233
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,980
find a way to evict these geese to hell.

1234
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,420
That's kind of what I think, is that they'll probably kill all the geese.

1235
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,420
That's what I'm saying is it'll kill all the geese.

1236
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,340
So there is, I think there's an unlimited number of times you can use this excuse would

1237
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,980
be my concern.

1238
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,860
I feel like Dilbert got weird when it was then more about sort of them killing geese.

1239
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,620
But I think sort of following Scott's sort of arc.

1240
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:54,340
His journey through this life and the sort of unorthodox path that he's decided to carve

1241
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:54,900
through it.

1242
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,220
I think it makes a lot of sense.

1243
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,540
Oh, Scott.

1244
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,260
Oh, Scott, you've done it again.

1245
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,340
You made us talk about you, Scott.

1246
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,340
You did it again, Scotty.

1247
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,140
This Jumbotron from Scott.

1248
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,780
Hey, do you guys want a quick Yahoo?

1249
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,540
Yeah.

1250
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,100
How quick?

1251
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:20,340
This one was sent in by level 9000 YajruDruid, Drew Davenport.

1252
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,900
Thank you, Drew.

1253
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:27,300
It's Yajru Answers User Greatest, who asks, why do people with baguettes think they are

1254
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,940
better than me?

1255
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,980
I was at the local grocery store asking where I could find a good meat to go on a charcuterie.

1256
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:41,300
And not one, but two people holding baguettes told me you seem like a deli ham kind of person.

1257
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,540
They seemed like they were talking down on me and I just wanted to know why baguettes

1258
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,820
make people mean.

1259
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,220
I don't believe this.

1260
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,860
I don't believe that anyone ever told anybody you look like a deli ham person.

1261
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,300
No, no, no.

1262
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,220
I guarantee here's what happened.

1263
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,300
Hey, where do I find meat for charcuterie?

1264
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,820
Oh, you should check out the deli.

1265
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,340
Oh, I'm a deli meat kind of person?

1266
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:12,340
Even if that, or this person said, where can I find meat for like a char-der-er-poo-dee?

1267
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,700
And it was like, maybe you should stick with bologna.

1268
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,500
That's what it was.

1269
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,980
These baguette havers, they heard you say, yeah, I'm looking for some good meats for

1270
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,180
charcuterie.

1271
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:27,300
And they're like, oh, babe, oh, sweetheart, you are not prepared for it.

1272
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,260
You're going to get hurt.

1273
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,060
You're going to hurt yourself.

1274
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,700
Yeah.

1275
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,100
Because some of these-

1276
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,860
We talked about charcuterie before on this show.

1277
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,820
You couldn't handle that.

1278
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,700
You can handle it.

1279
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,700
Some of those, they call it sharp cheddar for a reason.

1280
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,060
You don't even know where to look.

1281
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,180
Where are you going to find the honeycomb, the raw honeycomb?

1282
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,620
You don't.

1283
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,580
You can't.

1284
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,940
Get a Lunchable.

1285
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,580
Start there.

1286
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,980
A Lunchable is like, that's right.

1287
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,980
It's like a training charcuterie.

1288
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,700
Yeah.

1289
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,060
It's charcuterie junior.

1290
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,980
New from Hasbro.

1291
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,820
It is charcuterie.

1292
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,100
They should start calling it that.

1293
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,260
I bet you'd rope in some dumb people.

1294
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,300
Yeah.

1295
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,220
You could get charcuterie junior.

1296
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,020
Charcuterie.

1297
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,060
There it is.

1298
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:09,540
There it is.

1299
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,740
I was scraping for it.

1300
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,460
You found it.

1301
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,500
And you could do it like those bad Chevy commercials where you get a bunch of people sitting at

1302
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,940
a table and maybe they're professional chefs, some of the best chefs in the country.

1303
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,180
I'm talking about real Emeril Lagasse types.

1304
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:22,660
Sure.

1305
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:28,100
And they're sitting there at the table and you say, here, let's have some charcuterie

1306
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,740
while you wait and they eat it and then Emeril's like, hey, this is pretty good charcuterie.

1307
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,980
And you pull it off and it's been Lunchables and he'll never work in this town again.

1308
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,980
That'll teach him.

1309
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,620
That'll teach him for fucking kicking it up so much.

1310
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,580
There's a reason the rest of us aren't kicking it up all the time.

1311
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,300
Emeril, and now it's time for you to pay the piper.

1312
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,340
You've been embarrassed by my Lunchables commercial.

1313
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:54,580
Got you.

1314
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:58,260
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

1315
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,700
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1316
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,020
We hope you have enjoyed yourself very much.

1317
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,220
We want to say a huge thank you to Bridget Lancaster.

1318
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:13,700
You can watch her on America's Test Kitchen or you can download and listen to Proof,

1319
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,060
a podcast from America's Test Kitchen.

1320
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:21,940
I would highly recommend all episodes, but the ones about Bean Boozled.

1321
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,740
There's a two-parter about how they get the weird flavors in Bean Boozled Jelly Bellies.

1322
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,180
It is utterly fascinating that you should listen to.

1323
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,420
And we're very grateful to her for appearing on the program.

1324
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,740
We also want to say we are going to be at PodCon.

1325
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:38,980
Yes.

1326
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,060
That is coming up.

1327
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,380
It's January 19th and 20th.

1328
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:48,020
And so if you're in the Seattle area and you want to come, you can grab tickets at podcon.com.

1329
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:53,220
But there's also a remote attendance option where a little bit after the event,

1330
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,300
you can basically get recordings of all of the panels, performances,

1331
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,220
and live recordings from PodCon 2.

1332
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:04,100
So even if you can't make it, you can still hear all the stuff that's discussed there.

1333
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,780
Go to podcon.com.

1334
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,020
Also, go check out McElroy.family.

1335
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,540
There's a lot of cool stuff on there, but also there's a link to our live shows.

1336
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:19,460
And you can get your tickets for our upcoming Birmingham, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana

1337
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:25,300
shows that's coming up February 8th, 10th, and 11th, if I remember correctly.

1338
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,460
So go check that out, McElroy.family, as well as everything else we do.

1339
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:31,700
Yep.

1340
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,980
I think that pretty much covers it, right?

1341
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,900
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

1342
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1343
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,340
It's a great album, great song.

1344
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,820
We're very fortunate that we are able to use it.

1345
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,020
Check out the other Max Fun shows.

1346
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,260
JV Club.

1347
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:55,940
Rachel was on an episode this week, or I guess last week by the time you listened to this.

1348
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,980
That's cool.

1349
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,860
My wife!

1350
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,180
And yes, so that's very exciting.

1351
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,620
I can't wait to dip into that.

1352
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,700
It just came out right before we started recording.

1353
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,140
So yeah.

1354
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,180
And y'all want that final?

1355
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,580
Heck yeah.

1356
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,100
Sure do.

1357
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,740
Here it goes.

1358
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,060
This final Yahoo was sent in by Jeff Mock.

1359
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:17,700
Thanks, Jeff.

1360
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,580
It's Yahoo Answers user, Lana K, who asks,

1361
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:27,060
is it possible to be blowed out a whale's blowhole and life?

1362
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,460
My name is Justin McElroy.

1363
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,580

We will also have live music from Roseblood and live comedy from Katie Wen.
