1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my Brother by Brother Meat Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-oldest brother, Travis.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,680
Are we doing the baseball thing? Travis McElroy, McElroy.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm your friend, McElroy, your baby brother. Welcome home. Welcome back.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
Yeah, so-

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
Chet, thanks, everybody, for checking in on my die-die sort of stuff,

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
what was going on there vis-a-vis bone ejection.

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,480
Bone loss slash time loss.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,920
Is brain loss, but I'm feeling great. Brains and bones intact. Thank you all for your concern.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,120
Thank you for the Get Well cards. Thank you for the health soup that you sent to my house.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,240
You presumably sent.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
We have finished week one of our Hollywood lifestyle. We've done it.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,720
Here's the thing. We got two more episodes. This episode and the next episode of Move In

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,200
Maybe Game here is us all together recording after doing TV show shooting

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,800
all week. And just to all of my friends in the business, the red carpet business,

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I just want to say hats off to you for being able to grind out the products that we know

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
and we love so much. I'm talking about Cheers. I'm talking about Frasier.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Yeah, and I also appreciate all the support calls we've gotten from Kelsey Grammer and Ted Danson.

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,120
Welcome to the club, boys.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,320
Yeah, we were there once. Now it's your time. We got a lot of those calls,

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,440
which I appreciated a lot. David Borealis called me.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,480
Kelsey Grammers called me on my phone. He said, time for me to die now.

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,840
And I said, whoa, shit, Kelsey, no, no, there's really no reason. No, that's how it goes.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,560
And you open the door and Kelsey Grammer is standing outside. If I remember correctly,

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
it's getting outside. You're holding a literal torch that he passed to you and then dropped dead.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
And then he died right there.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Bob Euker card that played fight song when I opened it. And he's like, this is your moment.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
This is your time now.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
Travis, who did you kill and consume?

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
It was David Borealis, who I actually think is still making bones. So I think I have to go

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,640
beyond bones now.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
I think you're on, oh shit, Travis.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
No, I think your bone is trained and pulled in the station.

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Are you sure?

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
I haven't heard a lot of buzz.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Then I've got to go do bones too.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Either bones is off the air or bones has become relatively buzz free.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,520
I think it may be the second, which is a shame because I actually really like bones.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
Love bones.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,880
So this is our Bones Review podcast.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,200
It's just so good. It's so much fun to see it from like the science side, you know?

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm feeling legitimately pretty drained from the television making process. The TV shows,

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm happy to report, were pretty okay at it.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, it's going pretty well. Most of that is because we have like a really rocking crew.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We have an incredibly good team of people.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,720
So listen, I often find myself wondering, when famous people who have a lot of projects

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,480
going on do podcasts, I often find myself wondering, why are they so bad?

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,920
Much like you, a lot of you out there have probably wondered like,

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
why is this so bad?

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
I found out the reason this week.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Because they were fucking working.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,920
Because they're doing work all week and then they do a podcast and they're not working.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,240
When the podcast is you're working, it's a lot easier.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,960
It's a lot easier.

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,080
It's a lot easier to do one hour of work a week versus we have done five 12-hour days in a row.

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah, so I feel like we're all drained and not in the right headspace.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm not drained.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,520
I just, let me hand you this bottle of fluid. Can you read the label on the bottle?

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,440
That's right, it's Michael's secret stuff.

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Only it's comedy juice so it's Michael Richards and his secret stuff is racism.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
Do you think that they'd still be able to use the Michael's secret stuff goof

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,800
in like post like everyone worried about doping like 2016 America

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,080
without like the Monstars being like, hey, you can't do that.

68
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,480
I don't think the Monstars can fucking get on anybody for cheating.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,160
They're cheating as rowdy as punch around.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
They did seal the souls of Monty.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Are you gonna drink Michael Richards' piss or not?

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,920
I bought that on Etsy for six dollars.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,280
I don't want to get it twisted.

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't want to make you confused.

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm not feeling drained.

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
I've been doing this show for five days and I'm just so sick of my fucking shit.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,560
You know who I thought was the least funniest person in the world

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
before we started doing this television show?

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
Probably like Matt Lauer or somebody like that.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,480
Do you know who it is now?

82
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,040
Who?

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,920
Griffin Andrew McElroy, one of the hosts of my brother.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Oh man, I fucking hate that guy's jokes and comedy.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm actually a really big fan of my stuff.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,200
I just feel like day by day I've just been getting better and better,

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,320
like a fine wine, like a well-aged cheesecake.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
Should we get into what we do?

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
I was going to say the best, but we just do it.

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,600
Do a question.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
Read me a question, please.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,520
Here comes a question.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
I have a quick question for you.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,720
My husband left me in charge of his office aquarium

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
while he has gone away on a business trip.

96
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm not saying mistakes were made, but all of his fish are dead now.

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh my god.

98
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
He's coming back in a couple of days.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
So how do you think I should play this one out?

100
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
That's from Sincerely.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Oops.

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
Sincerely, Cory from Boy Meets World.

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:40,960
Yeah.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
Sincerely, Boris Simpson.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
This is a real pickle dickle you got yourself in, I think.

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
A real fickle dick.

107
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
I think what we've got here is we've got to do one of those like branch question things

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
where it's like, if you ask, go to here.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,680
Or it's like, did your husband actually like these fish?

110
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
If the answer is no.

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,280
You're good.

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,760
You're so good.

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,280
You've got to free him from a prison

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,920
that he can start to do himself during an ill-conceived moment.

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Oh yeah, maybe he was just like, you know what my office needs?

116
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,640
A fish tank.

117
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
And just like The Sims, he just dropped it.

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
Except unlike The Sims, you can't just like then go, no, and sell it back.

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm gonna let him piss himself to death.

120
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah.

121
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
And so maybe, okay, second question.

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
If you like this fish, yes.

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Second, how much?

124
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
Because if the answer is a lot, now you got to get into some shenanigans.

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
If it was like a little bit, you can replace those fish and he will never know.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,480
Yeah, if it's a lot, then we move into a new sphere of the Venn diagram

127
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,440
because this is the most confusing diagram that's ever been drawn up.

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
And then that circle of Venn diagram is, say, calm, hilarious.

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah.

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
This is, well, I need to get the fish.

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
And then it turns out he's taught the fish to come when called.

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
And these won't do it.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
And he's worried that they're sick.

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,960
So then you have to take them to the fish doctor together.

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
And the fish doctor is like, but I thought you said these were boys.

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
These are girl fish.

137
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Fuck these.

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
This is really good.

139
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
This is gonna be a really good episode.

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,880
Well, that's from the new episode of Kevin Can Wait starring Kevin James.

141
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
What if, here's one.

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,440
When he comes home, you open one of those big silver domes that have dinners underneath it,

143
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
and inside is two tiny fish fillets.

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
And you say, you're welcome.

145
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,560
One day when the boss get hungry, guess who's gonna be on the plate.

146
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Exactly.

147
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
I worked really hard on this.

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,320
And he'll be so touched by how hard you worked on this fish dinner.

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,040
He won't even think about the fact that you used his fish for it.

150
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,400
And you can just insist that that's what you thought they were for.

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,720
For real though, if I had pet fish and those motherfuckers ate it, I would want to eat.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
I think I want to eat them.

153
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
That's the only pet other than a bird.

154
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
But it'd have to be a big bird.

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not trying to work my mouth around a parakeet's body for a long time trying to find a good gristle.

156
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,920
But a clownfish, I'll fuck one of them up.

157
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,200
I would have to know that it happened, like on their terms.

158
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,160
That the fish led a good life, lived to its fullest, lived every day like they were dying,

159
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
and then died.

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
And then were deep fried.

161
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
How would you have any knowledge of-

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
Live every day like you're frying.

163
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,680
What if you, like, what if the fish had died from something dangerous to humans?

164
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,960
What do you mean?

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Like humanitis or something.

166
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
They die from that.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Oh, they got a bad case of humanitis, huh?

168
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Gunshot wounds.

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,320
One tiny gunshot wound.

170
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,960
Yeah, that's why these fish are bit by a vampire.

171
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
Yeah, they got a bad case of GSWs and you don't want to pass that on to your husband.

172
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
We're going to have to get fish CSI in here.

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
CSI Atlantis.

174
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
You're not saying mistakes were made.

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
So that leaves two solutions, in my mind, for what did happen.

176
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,640
First of all, it wasn't a mistake.

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,400
It was cruel intentions.

178
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,800
And you wanted to have sex with your step sister, I guess, and murder a bunch of fish.

179
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,840
That's possible.

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,440
The other option is that just like sometimes life has a crazy way of doing stuff.

181
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
And it was a crazy game of poker and all of these fish spontaneously died at the same time.

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
Then you've got like a happening kind of scenario.

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
All of them were the same, just destined to die at the same day.

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,280
What?

185
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,200
One day when I was a little boy, when I was a little boy, I had three teeth fall out in

186
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
the same day.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Crazy.

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
What are the odds it'll happen?

189
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,640
In the same vein, all 30 of these fucking fish just happened to be their time.

190
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,680
The thing that's very troubling about it is that there's not a number of fish.

191
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
That's what's bothering me.

192
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,160
Because if you said I killed a couple of his fish, I killed his two fish, I killed his

193
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,320
fish, that's all fine.

194
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
All his fish.

195
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,040
All his.

196
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
None shall pass.

197
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
None live to this.

198
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,240
This is like a Crimson Tide sort of situation.

199
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
I have an idea.

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,920
Very rarely are we, the McElroy brothers, able to offer any kind of real actionable

201
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
concrete help.

202
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
I would like to offer here our services as a scapegoat for this.

203
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay.

204
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,600
How could we have possibly fucked up all these fish?

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,680
Well, they played our podcast and they left it on accidentally overnight.

206
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,280
The fish went insane and just killed each other.

207
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
The hippie laughed themselves?

208
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,680
That was it.

209
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,200
The fish forgot that they couldn't breathe air and they came up to the top to listen

210
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
closer like, what did they say?

211
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
And they drowned in air.

212
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Wait, I think they're going to talk about elf.

213
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,120
Wait, hold on.

214
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,280
And they forgot to breathe.

215
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,480
The one topside.

216
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,160
Do you know how many people have died from forgetting to breathe while listening to our

217
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,660
podcast?

218
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
Sometimes I think about, and we've done a lot of great work here, but we've probably

219
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,240
killed dozens of people who were just listening so intently for the next good elf joke that

220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
they just stopped living.

221
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,920
Hi.

222
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
We've had a lot of fun here today.

223
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Here, we'll do a breathe here and now hold your breath because here comes a fucking fresh

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
Yahoo and don't even breathe in the middle of it or else it's bad luck.

225
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,400
This one's sent in by level9000.

226
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
Yajur Jiru, Davenport.

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
Thank you, Jiru.

228
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
It's by Yajur Answers User.

229
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
This website doesn't even fucking load anymore.

230
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,960
This website doesn't even fucking load anymore.

231
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:53,520
It's like, I go to like five websites and one of them has terminal, they don't give

232
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
a fuck-itis.

233
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,280
Melissa Mayer has her hand firmly on a knob and the knob when we started doing this podcast

234
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,360
was at 10 and it's been that way for a long time and she started to creep that knob counter

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
clockwise down into the zero position.

236
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
She's turning up the squelch knob on the IHU.

237
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
Okay, anyway, it's not loading so we'll say Parnell asks.

238
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,480
Chris Parnell asks, how to convince my teacher to start vape club?

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,840
No, no further info.

240
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
How to convince my teacher to start vape club?

241
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,880
What else?

242
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
What the fuck else do you need to know?

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
I feel like I know everything about this person.

244
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,720
Can I tell you just hands down before we go any further, the best part of vape club?

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,280
What's that?

246
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,640
It's going to be the field trips.

247
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,440
What do you mean?

248
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
It's going to be sick.

249
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
Well, you can go to different vape stores.

250
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Go to vape stores.

251
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,680
Maybe find the vape store that started it all.

252
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
I don't think kids are allowed in vape stores or maybe they are.

253
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,040
I don't know.

254
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
I've been out of the scene for a while.

255
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Is vaping, listen, bad for you?

256
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
A lot of people aren't quite sure about that.

257
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
It's not enough concrete research.

258
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
I will say this.

259
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
There's no concrete research is bad for how you look.

260
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,520
This is true.

261
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,640
That's a tough look to pull off is pulling a rip off a fucking chunky lightsaber,

262
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,040
pulling a big fucking bundle, a big bushel of cotton off a lightsaber,

263
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
and then blasting out your mouth while you're just chilling with your family at Applebee's.

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
It's a hard look to pull off.

265
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
Leo DiCaprio can't fucking like Leo's out there vaping on the reg

266
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
and he's trying to get like vapers rights like going and thank you,

267
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
Leo, for laying down on the barbed wire for the rest of us.

268
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,360
Hey, homie, you can't pull the look off, Leo.

269
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
Put the lightsaber down, Anakin.

270
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,120
He actually turned his Oscar into like the biggest vape rig in town.

271
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
He just bored straight through the senate.

272
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,400
That's why he wanted it so badly.

273
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,960
Do you know that?

274
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
You're saying he turned his only Oscar that he worked for 40 years to get

275
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
into a big nasty foam blaster.

276
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Yeah, just the chunkiest ripper.

277
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
It's just the fattest, shiniest, most prestigious cotton gin.

278
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,520
How do I convince, hey, yo, teach, got a hot new club idea for you

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
and it's coming at you now.

280
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,520
Check out this fucking cool piece of machinery.

281
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
It's called a vape.

282
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,080
In that scenario, do you approach the coolest teacher in the school

283
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,400
or go the other way, the least school teacher who needs it the most?

284
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Intriguing.

285
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,520
So Mr. Jefferson, you've been trying to up your profile with the teens for a while.

286
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,000
I've seen some of your snapchats and we'll talk about those in a bit.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But first, how about a little booster shot of coolness in the way of this,

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
my friend, an e-cigarette.

289
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,680
What?

290
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,080
There's certain, but to Travis's point, though, you could also run your odds

291
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,240
on getting the coolest teacher who's most likely to be down

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
and getting a teacher so old and out of it

293
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
that I think that they just couldn't process how cool it is when you vape.

294
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,520
They wouldn't be able to process the ideas of it as, oh, clouds are in there.

295
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
Well, it would have to be a science teacher.

296
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,520
I think a science teacher would be very, very fascinating.

297
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm talking about the mustache nerd man from Stranger Things,

298
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
who's like, who lets the kids-

299
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Oh, when he gives the whole lesson about how the flea vapes?

300
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,680
Yeah.

301
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,080
This is how the flea vapes.

302
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,600
Look at that chunky rip.

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
You're thinking about it on two-

304
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,600
The rips can be chunky, but they're not funky.

305
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,280
You're thinking of it on too small a scale.

306
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,240
I think that if your school vape club, it can get real good.

307
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
It's just ripping that big C.

308
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,840
Big buffers.

309
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,280
Then it can become a kind of point of pride for the whole school, right?

310
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
Or you can take it to state.

311
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
Our school's football program here at Vape U is not good,

312
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
but you know what we are good at?

313
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,480
We're good at making that fucking cumulonimbus.

314
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,880
Bring it on.

315
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
So you go to the vape competition against your rivals

316
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
and you just blow them out of the water with literal big chunky nimbus boys.

317
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,200
And then, yeah, now all of a sudden you're the jock.

318
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,160
Now all of a sudden you're the homecoming.

319
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
You're the vape jock.

320
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
You're the homecoming prince.

321
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,840
It's just like a screenplay I'm writing,

322
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,400
and I'm looking for any collaboration between you fuckers.

323
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,320
Do you think you can get Freddie Prinze Jr.?

324
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
I think Freddie Prinze Jr. probably loves vaping.

325
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,280
What celebrities do you guys secretly think

326
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,520
love to fucking rip cotton every day?

327
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,720
All right, Travis, we'll say the names at the exact same time.

328
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
Three, two, one, go.

329
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,840
You ready?

330
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah.

331
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Three, two, one, go.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
Jason Segal.

333
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
Johnny Depp probably pulls big clouds.

334
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
I feel like Johnny Depp probably pulls huge-

335
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
You don't think Jason Segal?

336
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Okay, this is a new quiz show on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

337
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
I'm just inventing this quiz show to help eat up time, okay?

338
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
So this is the quiz show.

339
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,400
Travis and I, I'm going to count to three, I'm going to say go,

340
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
and then Travis is going to say a name of a celebrity.

341
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
I have to top him with a celebrity who is more likely-

342
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
That is definitely more likely than-

343
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,440
Can I participate in this game?

344
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know why I'm being excluded.

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,720
I feel like you're judging.

346
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
No, we'll go around Robin.

347
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,720
We'll go around Robin.

348
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah, you're judging.

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
Okay, first one is Justin and I,

350
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
then we'll do Justin and Griffin, then we'll do Griffin and Travis.

351
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,440
Here we go.

352
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
I'll try to top the top winner that you guys put in.

353
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay.

354
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,320
Okay.

355
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,800
You ready?

356
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,520
Count down, Justin.

357
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
Because I fucking got it.

358
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,560
I have one that I think is going to win out.

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
Three, two-

360
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,160
Who's starting?

361
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,720
Travis is starting.

362
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Okay.

363
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,520
Three, two, one, go.

364
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Rider strong.

365
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,320
Oh boy.

366
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

367
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
You gave me too much time to think.

368
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Your one mistake was letting me live.

369
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,760
For each one, I mean, it's good.

370
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
I can't put a number on it.

371
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
No, no, no, no.

372
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,160
You count it off and I have to try to beat Travis.

373
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
If I don't, he wins.

374
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,880
Okay, three, two, one, go.

375
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Corey Feldman.

376
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,280
Oh my God.

377
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,640
That's really good.

378
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
That's really good.

379
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,600
That's really good.

380
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
Travis, your rebuttal.

381
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,640
Okay, give me a count.

382
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,280
Three, two, one, go.

383
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Lil Wayne.

384
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,520
Here's the thing.

385
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,560
Yes, yes, yeah.

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,400
I mean, but that one's like, yeah.

387
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
I think he was probably vaping.

388
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,520
He was maybe the first person to start vaping.

389
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,640
So like, I would give you that.

390
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,600
But I did just Google Corey Feldman vape and I got a news alert from-

391
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
A news alert?

392
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,920
A news alert from Podcat that says Corey Feldman on, quote, totally vaping awesome.

393
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,280
Okay, you win this round, Justin.

394
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,760
Okay.

395
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,160
Okay, everyone who just listed is out.

396
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
Justin versus Griffin.

397
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,240
Justin, you gotta go first.

398
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,880
You ready?

399
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,360
Yes.

400
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,680
Three, two, one, go.

401
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,400
Jake Busey.

402
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,520
Who?

403
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,960
Jake Busey.

404
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Gary Busey's son, Jake Busey.

405
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
It's kind of a deep cut, but okay.

406
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,680
I mean, I'm about to end this fucking game forever.

407
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,400
Okay, you ready?

408
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
Griffin, rebuttal.

409
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Three, two, one, go.

410
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
John Leguizamo.

411
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,440
How's your fucking clouds, John?

412
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,120
Justin just literally physically reeled backwards from that hit.

413
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
That is not a joke.

414
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
So fucking nasty.

415
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,280
Okay, Justin, you have one chance to rebut.

416
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,760
Wait, hold on.

417
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,320
Can't be done.

418
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
Can't be done.

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,280
Let me just dig deep and see if I got anything in the tank.

420
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
All right, just give me a second.

421
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
You have four seconds.

422
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,000
You ready?

423
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
No, no, don't say four seconds.

424
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
You don't have that much time, Justin.

425
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,040
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Time is ticking away.

427
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
I'll pause the recording if I have to, please.

428
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,160
Okay.

429
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,560
Just give me a second to think, because Griffin's been sitting on John Leguizamo.

430
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,520
Justin's crying.

431
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,320
He's weeping.

432
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
Griffin's been sitting on John Leguizamo for like a full minute.

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,040
Nobody vapes harder than Johnny Legs, babe.

434
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,240
Okay.

435
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,800
No.

436
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,680
Justin, I'm sorry.

437
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,320
Your time is up.

438
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
You're gonna have to name it in three, two-

439
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

440
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
No, that's not how the game works, Justin.

441
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,720
This is an infinite time.

442
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,520
Justin, you've been beaten.

443
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,840
Three, two, one, go.

444
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
Carrot top.

445
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Come on.

446
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,720
That's real.

447
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Okay.

448
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
I need you to Google it.

449
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
Let's go to the Google tape.

450
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
If I Google carrot top vape and you get a result, I'll call you the winner.

451
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,360
Okay, so the top-

452
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,720
Well, no, this is not-

453
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
This is a parody.

454
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
This is a mean, awful parody account.

455
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,640
No.

456
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,680
No, that's not real.

457
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:03,760
There is a YouTube video on how to vape a carrot, parenthesis, easy, parenthesis, no knife required.

458
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,800
What is the fucking backwards scenario?

459
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
What's the use case?

460
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,320
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
I want all this juice and this battery and this heater, I guess.

462
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
Travis, I need your opinion.

463
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
John Leguizamo wins.

464
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,440
John Leguizamo wins.

465
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm sorry.

466
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,360
If we had had any conclusive-

467
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
If I get a single vape result for John Leguizamo, I'm sorry.

468
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,920
If I get a single vape result for John Leguizamo-

469
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,720
You won't, but it doesn't-

470
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
Listen, I'm the judge in this scenario, Justin.

471
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,080
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,560
That's right.

473
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,880
All right, now, motherfuckers, now it's on.

474
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,440
Griffin, you gotta go first.

475
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
Griffin, you're leading off.

476
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh, God, we're doing me and Travis?

477
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, of course we are.

478
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,920
All right.

479
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,480
Three, two, one, go.

480
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,760
President, that's right, Bill Clinton.

481
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
Oh, okay, that's pretty good.

482
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
Okay, I've got one.

483
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,600
Okay.

484
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,720
Okay.

485
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,280
Count it down.

486
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,200
Three, two, one, go.

487
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
Russell Brand.

488
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,280
Well.

489
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, I'm not sure.

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,800
See, I think-

491
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Oh, no, he's-

492
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Rebuttal, three, two, one, Russell Crowe.

493
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,760
Fuck!

494
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,480
I don't think that that's even accurate.

495
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,680
My worry is that-

496
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
None of these are good.

497
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,360
Three, two, one, Bill Paxton.

498
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
Oh, wait, fuck, okay, wait.

499
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,720
Count me down.

500
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay, three, two, one-

501
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
Oh, Travis is hot.

502
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,400
Randy Quaid.

503
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
Randy Quaid probably has a bandolier of vapes.

504
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
Yeah, sure.

505
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
I think we've got about everything we're gonna get out of this game.

506
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,080
All right.

507
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,200
But thank you for coming up with it.

508
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
It is a fun game you can play with your friends at home.

509
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,360
Yeah.

510
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
Who do the-

511
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
It's called Who Do Vape?

512
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
It's called Most Likely to Vape.

513
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,200
Vape Awards.

514
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,120
Vape Escape.

515
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,680
Vape who?

516
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,760
I've managed to befriend the guy at the restaurant near my work

517
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
by repeating the things my coworkers say about sports.

518
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
Oh, God.

519
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
I get falafels there about twice a week and notice other people

520
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,560
who are chumming with him get a drink at no charge, whereas I do not.

521
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
I only want a soda if I don't have to pay for it,

522
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,600
but I can only tell if it's going to be free if I ask for one.

523
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
If you really seem to like my sports regurgitation today,

524
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll take a risk and ask for soda.

525
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
But so far, I've ended up having to pay for each of them.

526
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,000
How can I tell you when our friendship has crossed the line

527
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,600
into free soda range, the FSR, and how can I get it there faster?

528
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
That's from Nervous in Nebraska.

529
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
Hey, dog.

530
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
There's a really busted way to think about another person.

531
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
That's a crazy-

532
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,680
People aren't like the soda vending machine

533
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,960
that you put enough fucking sports nuggets into.

534
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm sorry.

535
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
That'll be 10 more sports before you can have a free Coke.

536
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,960
I guarantee you falafel guy's not thinking of it that way.

537
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
You'd be like, I don't know, that was pretty good,

538
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,520
but not exactly-

539
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,680
He's not a fucking bridge troll

540
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,000
whose sports riddles you have to conquer

541
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
before you can get a Dr. Pepper on the fridge.

542
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,880
Yeah, what if falafel guy is awesome?

543
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
What if falafel guy's great?

544
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
All my friends are friends with falafel guy.

545
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
Yeah, it's because they ask about his kids.

546
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,200
They don't just say,

547
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Chad Pennington, big strong arm on that boy, huh?

548
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,800
How about a Dr. Pepper, thank you.

549
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Maybe that's it.

550
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
Maybe you keep regurgitating sports,

551
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
but he wants to talk about the latest episode of Down in Abbey,

552
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,920
or he wants to talk about your theories

553
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,480
on what's really going on in King and Killer Chronicles.

554
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,120
You know what I mean?

555
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
And he's like, I guess sports.

556
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah, football's great.

557
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
I cannot fathom floating out sports trivia

558
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
that there is a chance of follow-up

559
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,760
where I would just have to like-

560
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
You don't think he's better than Beerson?

561
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm smashed.

562
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,960
There is no player named Beerson.

563
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,680
Ah, you've still got your free soda.

564
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah, I guess you're not a Kremlin spy, as I suspected.

565
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Congratulations, compatriot.

566
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
Do you think, Justin, on the spot right now,

567
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
could you give me a sports nugget

568
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,160
to earn some sort of favor from me?

569
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
Could you give me a sports nug right now?

570
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
A sports nug right now?

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Right now.

572
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
Current sports nug.

573
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,360
Current sports nug.

574
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,000
Some tough injuries in the preseason, huh?

575
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
That's good.

576
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,080
That is true.

577
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,640
That is true.

578
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,600
I mean, that's always true.

579
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
Tony Romo broke his fucking back.

580
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,720
This is good.

581
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
That's an astute observation.

582
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,960
Then, okay, and then I would give you a soda for that.

583
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,080
Did you hear about Tony Romo?

584
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,720
Like, yes.

585
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
Of course I heard about Tony Romo and his sad back.

586
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
Oh, maybe you give some form of analysis

587
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
that no one else has and you say like,

588
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
hey, did you hear about Tony Romo's back?

589
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
And he's like, yeah, it's really bad.

590
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,480
And you're like, I'm just worried about his kids.

591
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
He'll never dance again.

592
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,040
And then the guy's like, what?

593
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,880
He's like, yeah, he dances all the time.

594
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,840
You compound it.

595
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,520
Like, the back is so important for a football bone.

596
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:37,920
Yeah.

597
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,240
What was that, you got three important football bones.

598
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
And I'm going to tell you this,

599
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
and I might get thirsty in the middle.

600
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,560
So if you just want to get me a bark soup, you're ready.

601
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Anyway, three important football bones, arms,

602
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
use them for catching, stiff arming, throwing,

603
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
all very, very important.

604
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
Number two, and this is not in order

605
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
because I think number two is number one,

606
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,800
but the back is really, really good.

607
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,480
It's sort of what connects all the other

608
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
very, very important bones.

609
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
And I think it's like what sends your thoughts

610
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
to the rest of your body to do them.

611
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
Anyway, the third one is your skull, I guess,

612
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
because it's where your brain lives.

613
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
Very important.

614
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

615
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,480
Absolutely.

616
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

617
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
Keep it waving, Morgan Davey.

618
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jesse, who asks,

619
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,160
the Ghostbusters theme won't stop playing

620
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,920
on my computer nonstop.

621
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,680
No application or background app is being used.

622
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Help.

623
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,120
The Ghostbusters theme, it just won't stop playing

624
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
on my fucking PC.

625
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,400
There's no apps playing the Ghostbusters theme.

626
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
I've closed out Ghostbusters.exe.

627
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
That one's definitely, it's not,

628
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
and it's not running in the background.

629
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
No application or background app is being used.

630
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,620
Help.

631
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,840
It could be like the most ironic ghosts in the world.

632
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, that's funny.

633
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
That's a fun.

634
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
That's a fun ghost who's just like,

635
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
yeah, I like it too.

636
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm not.

637
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
Here's a dirty secret about us ghosts.

638
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,640
Our favorite song, Ghostbusters.

639
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,560
It also makes us feel good.

640
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Busting is a two-way street.

641
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
Busting gives ghosts orgasms.

642
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Did you know that?

643
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,280
Busting makes them feel good.

644
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,560
Why do you think they call them Slimer?

645
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,240
We can't talk about Slimer's sexual proclivities again.

646
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,600
Busting makes ghosts cum.

647
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,880
That's true.

648
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
My business is finished.

649
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,600
That's the only thing that makes ghosts cum.

650
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,360
Do you know that they're getting spun around in those lasers?

651
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
They're like, not too quick, Ray.

652
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,040
Please make it last.

653
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I don't want to think about Ghostbuster cum.

654
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,800
Ghostbusters don't cum.

655
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,320
All Ghostbusters are eunuchs.

656
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,040
They're castrated when they take up the mantle.

657
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,160
But ghosts do.

658
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,120
They can't be tempted.

659
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Not after the glow job.

660
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,800
That's the one thing they don't tell you about ghosts.

661
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,760
What is that?

662
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,400
They're nasty.

663
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,160
And I think that's the main purpose for our podcast existing.

664
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,120
Just trying to get the word out.

665
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,000
Just trying to get the word out.

666
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,040
Ghosts are going to come at you left, right, and genital words.

667
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,200
So keep an eye out before they munch on you.

668
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,880
What other things could cause the Ghostbusters theme

669
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
to be playing constantly on your computer?

670
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,240
I think Edward Snowden is like, I think he's bored.

671
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,120
I think Edward Snowden's probably pretty fucking bored right now.

672
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,840
He's just killing time until the movie drops and he's psyched.

673
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
He cannot wait to get the word out.

674
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,960
By the way, this is our sort of way of saying, get to theaters.

675
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
Get to Snowden.

676
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
Please love Snowden.

677
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,920
It's a pretty good combo of Snowden and JGL.

678
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,640
It's got JGL in it.

679
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,040
And we're all just going to have a fucking great time at Snowden this summer.

680
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,680
Oh, yeah.

681
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,280
Do you think that the Ghostbusters theme song playing in the background of your computer

682
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,600
is like really guerrilla marketing for Snowden?

683
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
That's kind of a weird myth.

684
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,800
We've hacked it.

685
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,960
Well, maybe they're partnered with Ghostbusters.

686
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,240
Is it possible?

687
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
You know how sometimes there are sister movies?

688
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,800
And Stone is a sister movie to the Ghostbusters?

689
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,640
You know, maybe this person doesn't have a computer and they've just gone bust crazy.

690
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,880
You know what I mean?

691
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,640
It's like, it's such a catchy tune that's like on loop in their own brain.

692
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,040
He just stares at the wall all day long.

693
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,840
He's singing.

694
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,240
He stares at that dumb cardboard computer you made and sings the Ghostbusters.

695
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,600
And it's just a cardboard computer and it's written on the screen, no Ghostbusters.

696
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
That's weird.

697
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,160
He uses a literal mouse to try to click on the screen on all those Ghostbuster related

698
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,400
apps.

699
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Let's go to Buddy's end.

700
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,280
What if there's a new iTunes?

701
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,920
Wait, clip that out.

702
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,640
Go ahead, Griffin.

703
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
What if they updated iTunes with the new stuff?

704
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,720
I don't watch the press conferences anymore.

705
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,320
But there's a new secret iTunes that runs underneath the subroutines of your computer,

706
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
hiding deep.

707
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,840
J-Tunes.

708
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
It's called Guy-Tunes.

709
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,720
It's a mean Guy-Tunes that play pranks on you.

710
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,480
It's called iTunes, except there's a number in there.

711
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
It's called iTunes, T-O-O-N-S.

712
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,000
It's very whimsical.

713
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
iTunes, and he's a little prankster.

714
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
Hi, I'm Guy-Tunes.

715
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
I live in your computer.

716
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,040
Why is there so much Shakira playing?

717
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,240
It's not mean Guy-Tunes.

718
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
It's regular iTunes.

719
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
I can't find the photos of my wedding anywhere.

720
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,640
I deleted them.

721
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,160
You're a dick.

722
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
No, listen, I deleted your wedding photos on Guy-Tunes.

723
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,440
That's pretty cute.

724
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Why are you fucking Amelie now?

725
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
Why are you fucking encroaching?

726
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
Now I've got a new voice.

727
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,480
I'm Guy-Tunes.

728
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
Busting makes ghosts come.

729
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,280
Guy-Tunes, too, by now, is a lot snarkier.

730
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
The kids are gonna love him.

731
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
I don't work on your phone.

732
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
Okay, Guy-Tunes, why are you even here?

733
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
Apple's kind of lost their way.

734
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,360
Hey!

735
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,120
Much like one of my favorite podcasts, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

736
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,480
I don't have My Brother, My Brother, and Me anymore.

737
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,200
Shit them out.

738
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
They went Corpo.

739
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,520
They went what?

740
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Yeah, they got a TV show, went Corpo.

741
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
They went Corpo Christie.

742
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,800
I don't want to hear them no more.

743
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
Let's go to Mason.

744
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:21,360
We're sponsored and powered by MeUndies this week,

745
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,280
and I'm going to teach you something I've never done before.

746
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,760
Oh, yeah.

747
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm not going to fucking look at the copy at all.

748
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,320
Hell yeah.

749
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,720
You got it?

750
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,520
You doing it?

751
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,080
Hell yeah.

752
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,640
You know what?

753
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,160
Pants off, dance off.

754
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,600
Everybody's wearing MeUndies.

755
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,480
What are you doing?

756
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm staring at my brother's crotches.

757
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, we're not staring.

758
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Just appreciating.

759
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,560
We're, we've recorded a TV show this week.

760
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,640
12 hour days, five days in a row.

761
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,840
I refuse to go in to do the TV show without MeUndies on.

762
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
I've worn MeUndies every day.

763
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,960
I will continue to do MeUndies.

764
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
If I do not have a clean pair of MeUndies ready for the show,

765
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,000
I will cancel that day's filming until MeUndies are clean.

766
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,680
This is a Travis McElroy guarantee.

767
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
I did an episode not in MeUndies,

768
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,000
and it was at the end of the day like a rag

769
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,880
they used to clean up all the tables out of Wendy's.

770
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
They used really good fabric and they're really comfortable

771
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
and they look really great on everybody

772
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
and they're really super cool.

773
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,680
Get out, go away.

774
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,480
Go away, cat.

775
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
We're talking about underpants in our underpants.

776
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,640
We're back.

777
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,760
The cat is gone.

778
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,160
Justin.

779
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:17,840
What?

780
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,800
Take your pants off.

781
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,440
Are you wearing MeUndies?

782
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
I'm not wearing MeUndies today.

783
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm not taking my fucking pants off.

784
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
Are you wearing any Undies?

785
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
No, listen, now you have to take your pants off

786
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
so we can fucking shame you for not wearing the good underwear.

787
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,360
Are you wearing any Undies?

788
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,400
This is important.

789
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Yes, I'm wearing Undies.

790
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,040
Take them off and let's see what you've got on.

791
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,760
I don't want to take them off.

792
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
Justin, take off your fucking pants.

793
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
He's doing it.

794
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:37,920
Here we go.

795
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,480
Here we go.

796
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,280
What are we working with?

797
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,440
Oh, he's going way too slow.

798
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh, I see.

799
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Okay.

800
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
Well, these are non-

801
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,160
We can't say that.

802
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,120
Don't say the brand name on it.

803
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
These are non-MeUndies.

804
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh, Justin.

805
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,640
They're just like that.

806
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,440
That's why I keep...

807
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
If you guys have wondered why through this whole...

808
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm just going to leave them off.

809
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,040
This is good.

810
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,920
This is actually, I'm trying to say, this is kind of nice.

811
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
If you guys have been wondering why through the whole episode

812
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,720
I've been mouthing you, my dick is itchy.

813
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,080
It's just because you're wearing like a bag down there.

815
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
It does look like a burlap sack.

816
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,960
Yeah.

817
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,520
And why did they sew so many zippers into it?

818
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,160
I don't know.

819
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,720
I'll never know.

820
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,000
But this, I will look back at the copy here because shipping in the US and Canada...

821
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Shipping is free in the US and Canada and you can save $8 a pair with the MeUndies subscription

822
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,080
plan, which is a really good deal.

823
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,680
You should do it because eventually the dream is you get to like basic zero.

824
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,400
You just wipe out all your bad undies and they're all good MeUndies.

825
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,440
The singularity.

826
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,360
And you can get a subscription or a single pair and get 20% off your first order when

827
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,120
you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother, that's MeUndies.com slash my brother for 20% off your

828
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,520
order.

829
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,800
MeUndies.com slash my brother.

830
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,120
Do it.

831
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,960
Griffin, tell me about fucking Squarespace.

832
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
I'm going to tell you all about fucking Squarespace.

833
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,280
But first I got a question for you boys.

834
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,600
Yes.

835
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Do you think Anderson Cooper has like a really little skinny vape that he uses?

836
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,320
Yeah, but I bet it's really long.

837
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,520
I bet it's really nice and really long and really great.

838
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,840
All right, here comes an ad for Squarespace.

839
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,040
Squarespace, it's just all that you need to put together something like a landing page

840
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,080
or a beautiful gallery or professional blog or an online store.

841
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,920
It's all included with your Squarespace website.

842
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,160
Say you want to start a website in which people can submit two different celebrity names and

843
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
then do a poll of who thinks that they vape the best.

844
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,520
That's the new hot or not vape or nape.

845
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,160
Well, that's good.

846
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Vapornape.com.

847
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,200
Do you guys think I can get Vapornaut.com right now?

848
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Vapornaut.com.

849
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
Wait, listen, this is happening live.

850
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,840
Vapornaut.com.

851
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,560
We're going to use it.

852
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,840
Don't go to the website.

853
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,200
I just want to try to register it.

854
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Okay, don't go to it.

855
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,280
I'm just saying that this is how fast and easy it is and then you can build it on Squarespace

856
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,680
because creating websites on Squarespace is simple.

857
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
Jesus, you still fucked it up.

858
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,480
I know, but listen, Squarespace is so good.

859
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,880
It's where we built macroshows.com.

860
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,320
I've known nothing about like website computer sites and I made it really good.

861
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Clearly, that's what you're calling me.

862
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
I've never made a computer site before in my life and I made macroshows.com and it turned

863
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,720
out very well and it's so easy to make changes on an update and everything and you should

864
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,440

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,560
They have great seamless commerce tools.

868
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,320
You can actually make money off your website.

869
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,120
Their customer support is like beyond compare.

870
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,400
It's amazing, beautiful templates, custom designs, all kinds of shit.

871
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,120
Go check it out.

872
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,080
Squarespace.com.

873
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,040
You're going to love it.

874
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,360
All right.

875
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
I found a website that can generate two random celebrities at will.

876
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
Let's start with this first one.

877
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,920
This is just a trial test for vape or not.

878
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,040
You can play a line at home.

879
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,000
Number one, Ben Affleck or Marilyn Monroe.

880
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
That's kind of a tricky one.

881
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
That's kind of a gimme.

882
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
If she could.

883
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,400
If she could.

884
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
That's a good question.

885
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
This has nothing to do with death.

886
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,400
Vape transcends death.

887
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Oh, this is good.

888
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Okay, fuck.

889
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
Now, Justin, you're going to hear this one and you're going to think you know the answer,

890
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,400
but I really need you to sit on it.

891
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,040
Howard Stern or Jennifer Garner.

892
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,560
Okay.

893
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,520
Here's the thing, though.

894
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,760
Yeah.

895
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,080
Howard Stern is in an enclosed space for many, many hours each day during his workday.

896
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
I don't think he could be vaping in there.

897
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh, yeah.

898
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,880
That's a good point.

899
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,200
You rip some chunky cotton in the face of like whoever you had in studio that day.

900
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
This is a really, really good one.

901
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,960
This is tough, Justin.

902
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,160
I need you to really buckle down on this one.

903
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,720
Dial in.

904
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,520
Give it to me.

905
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
Hulk Hogan or Ian McKellen.

906
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Sir Ian McKellen or Hulk Hogan.

907
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,480
Who vapes?

908
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,240
In this case, it's who vapes the most because they definitely both rip cotton.

909
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,200
Here's the thing.

910
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,600
I've seen one of those human beings depicted blowing gigantic ship cotton.

911
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Gigantic starship cotton.

912
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,000
Like there's no question it's Ian McKellen.

913
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,400
Correct.

914
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
Of course it is.

915
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah, he can make boats and shit.

916
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
Just one last one.

917
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,200
Kristen Stewart of the Twilight movies or Michael Jordan, the dunk man himself.

918
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,480
Mr.

919
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,960
Dunkster.

920
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,680
That's what I call him.

921
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,000
Mr.

922
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,320
Hoops.

923
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
That's why he retired finally.

924
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
He's like, I have a new sport.

925
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
I have got a new challenge for the feet.

926
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,960
And he's using I've got to go slay a new dragon.

927
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,320
That motherfucker can stand on the half court line and he can take in a deep, deep billowing

928
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,360
breath and he can get it into the hoop from from there.

929
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,200
And it's it's remarkable stuff.

930
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,680
Okay.

931
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,200
Tristan Stewart should not be discounted, though, because I bet she can rip mad cotton.

932
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,920
Yeah.

933
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760
Troubling news has just come in.

934
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
Vapor not is taken.

935
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,280
Damn it.

936
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
Who vapes dot com is taken.

937
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,520
You guys got any like what are we going to star vape star vape stars who vape?

938
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
How about star vape stars?

939
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Which star vapes which stars?

940
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Which one vapes?

941
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,200
Which one vape?

942
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Which one is vapes?

943
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,080
Great.

944
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,160
Because then we can spend it off to like amateur.

945
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
Oh, here's one battle of the Pauls.

946
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
Again, this is just a random celebrity generator.

947
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,080
But Paul Rudd or Paul Newman.

948
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,560
Fuck.

949
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,240
Paul Newman would look so cool with a fucking big fat rig hanging out of his mouth.

950
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680
It's probably Paul Newman.

951
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,720
So here's what here's what.

952
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:06,320
OK, so here's Danica Patrick, the race car driver or Jay Leno, the race car driver, race

953
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,240
car driving, vaping cool guy.

954
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,000
OK, so here's the way I think here's here's here's what I got.

955
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,080
I got which one vapes dot com.

956
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,760
And I think that's very good.

957
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,480
Now, here's here's the way I think which one of these works.

958
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,600
I will get to we got a little bit more in the money zone.

959
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,320
We're going to say which one vapes, I believe, is two options.

960
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,960
You can log on to help us categorize stars.

961
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,160
And so a picture of a star comes up and you have like a fun slider.

962
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,040
By the way, this is how fucking Facebook got started.

963
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,840
Yeah, so I might be excitement is through the roof.

964
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,520
Yeah, so you can you rate the stars, right?

965
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
But it's on one of ten.

966
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,880
How likely is it that they vape?

967
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,160
And then the other one is a contest where you have two stars in front of you and you

968
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,240
have to choose which one probably vapes.

969
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,680
I guess the winner or loser is based on community voting.

970
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
So it's all theoretical.

971
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,320
I love this because what I love about that is you don't like if there's someone who's

972
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,760
like a one like Allison Hannigan, I don't think Allison Hannigan vapes.

973
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,160
Right.

974
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,000
Probably like how Allison Hannigan.

975
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,840
I'm not just saying this because they're both redheads.

976
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,440
They just happen to be brought to my head.

977
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,360
Allison Hannigan versus Felicia Day.

978
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,840
I feel like that's a good like I couldn't choose.

979
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,560
But that's what I'm saying between the two, who's most likely is tough.

980
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,640
So you want to categorize it in one to ten.

981
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,480
So you get two ones against each other where you don't like Allison Hannigan versus, you

982
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
know, Bill Clinton.

983
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,120
Like, that's too obvious.

984
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,920
You know what I mean?

985
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,080
Yeah.

986
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,920
If you select if you build the tech for this and you want that redirect, just get at me.

987
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
We'll set it up.

988
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,840
We'll get which one vapes and listen and then we'll retire.

989
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Please, after you make it, please write the bar.

990
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm like, this this was just for laughs.

991
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,560
This is not legally binding.

992
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,680
This is not legally binding.

993
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,240
People know.

994
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
But for real, though, A-Rod or Marissa Tomei.

995
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,160
I'm in love with this random celebrity generator.

996
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,040
Yo dog, Denzel Washington or Dustin Hoffman.

997
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,800
That's actually a really tough one.

998
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,840
That would be a tough one.

999
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,720
Which one would vape?

1000
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,680
Man, I feel like Dustin Hoffman would try vaping for like three weeks and decide it's

1001
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,400
not for him.

1002
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
That seems like his jam.

1003
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,440
OK, so we got a little Jumbotron message.

1004
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
OK, we got a Jumbotron here.

1005
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,960
This is for Bill Buehler and it's from Matthew, Emily, Morgan and Blake.

1006
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,440
Merry Christmas 2015, Bill.

1007
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh, God.

1008
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
Whoops.

1009
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
Whoops a daisy.

1010
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,600
We thought we said no presents last year, but perhaps not.

1011
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Your thoughtfulness and our awfulness aside, let's hope let's let the McElroy say thank

1012
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
you for your gifts for us.

1013
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,080
Hopefully hearing it from the brothers takes the edge off the shocking delay.

1014
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,320
And while we're here, happy birthday, September 1st, and no presents in 2016.

1015
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,080
We kind of missed it on both.

1016
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,400
I feel like they're trolling us with this one.

1017
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,000
This feels like a troll to me because I don't know how we would make it nine months.

1018
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,760
We're not gestating over here.

1019
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
We're just answering questions.

1020
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,120
We're getting our Jumbotrons through the Pony Express at this point.

1021
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,560
So we apologize for all this.

1022
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,840
I got a message for Dan and it's from Beth and it says, hey, Dan, would it surprise you

1023
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,200
to hear that I'm sleepy?

1024
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,560
Thanks for being my organic alarm clock at five thirty a.m. each day so I can get to

1025
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,280
work.

1026
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,080
I'm sorry for being a morning Beth each time.

1027
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,840
But could you give me a minute?

1028
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,440
I feel like a snoozy koala being kicked out of a tree sometimes.

1029
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,360
Just steal the Duna.

1030
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Trust me, I'll get up.

1031
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
All of this is a no idea.

1032
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,120
Beth, what's a Duna?

1033
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,200
Listen, we here at McElroy Industries do not endorse stealing the Duna.

1034
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
Don't steal the Duna.

1035
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,880
Don't steal the Duna.

1036
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
That's my favorite childhood board game.

1037
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,320
Don't steal the Duna.

1038
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
OK, as near as I can tell, Duna is a car seat.

1039
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,440
So, OK, this has been sent to us by a hyper aware sentient baby.

1040
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Oh, it's one of those babies.

1041
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
Super baby geniuses.

1042
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
Super genius babies.

1043
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,760
What's the deal with Brexit?

1044
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,960
Have you seen Happy Valley yet?

1045
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
How do British people pronounce Edinburgh, Leicester or Norwich?

1046
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,120
Not like that.

1047
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Are you tired of getting your world news from reliable sources, often with no puns or sexual

1048
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,760
innuendo?

1049
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
Why was there a butcher's hat haunting Coronation Street?

1050
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
What's Coronation Street?

1051
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,680
And why is Dave Holmes obsessed with it?

1052
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,240
International Waters pairs a team of comedians in LA against a team of comedians in London

1053
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
in a pop culture battle royale.

1054
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,440
Join us once a fortnight to hear the best comedians in the world trade jokes and stories

1055
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
and maybe even learn something at the same time.

1056
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
International Waters with me, Dave Holmes.

1057
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
Find it at maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

1058
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,880
Um, do you guys want to go?

1059
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,440
Uh, yeah.

1060
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,840
Go ahead.

1061
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,320
That's what I said.

1062
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,880
And I keep it.

1063
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,920
I want a munch munch.

1064
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,880
You guys are right across from me.

1065
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,360
You can help me out.

1066
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Well, I did it.

1067
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,240
It's hard for me to get on board because here's the thing.

1068
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,520
You know me, dog.

1069
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,360
You know, I love the munch squad.

1070
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,200
But one thing about the munch squad is that it's a it's very rude because it's a rude bit.

1071
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
But that's why it hypes up the energy.

1072
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
If you cause you're a rude, crude dude, here we go.

1073
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,840
So let's try.

1074
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,800
I want a munch squad.

1075
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
No, I'm saying squad.

1076
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,360
You say squad.

1077
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,040
I want a munch squad.

1078
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,400
I want to munch squad.

1079
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1080
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,280
This is a show within a show.

1081
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,560
You're joining us here.

1082
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,520
You're joining us here.

1083
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm bringing you the latest in fast food trends.

1084
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,760
Fuck.

1085
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
But can I just real quick Paul McCartney or Adam Sandler?

1086
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm Sir Paul McCartney.

1087
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,400
Check this out.

1088
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,800
That was my Adam Sandler.

1089
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,360
Oh, that was?

1090
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,600
I guess I did a little song Paul McCartney would sing while he vapes out a coffee.

1091
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,040
I feel like Paul McCartney would just sit and say,

1092
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
is a vape trick called Penny Lane?

1093
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,800
And he just inhaled and exhale.

1094
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,080
And he thinks that's a vape trick.

1095
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
And he just keep naming them after Beatles songs.

1096
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,880
That's really good.

1097
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,520
That's so good.

1098
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,680
He would play the fucking flute solo on it.

1099
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,400
His vape rig is the flute that they play in Penny Lane.

1100
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,800
So this is a show within a show where I highlight the latest and greatest

1101
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
in fast food evolution.

1102
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,320
And not just that.

1103
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,600
I don't just tell you about the items.

1104
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,440
What I tell you is-

1105
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,080
He throws that he buys them and throws them directly in a toilet.

1106
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
No, I don't try them myself.

1107
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,680
I listen to the experts, the professionals in marketing

1108
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,640
and the executive branch of each of these outlets and what they say.

1109
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
I need you to drive that concept home more, Justin,

1110
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,480
because we routinely get people like,

1111
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,840
why don't you try those new Cheeto Dorito cheese things?

1112
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,520
No, we don't try shit.

1113
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,240
I tell you what the people who are making them say about them

1114
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,920
because they are the experts, okay?

1115
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,240
So today it's salad from Domino's.

1116
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,720
Oops.

1117
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,280
Oops.

1118
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,880
Okay, I was raved with that, Trace.

1119
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,680
Now here is the quote.

1120
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,760
This one comes to us from Joe Jordan, chief marketing officer at Domino's.

1121
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Actually, before I bring you that,

1122
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
let me tell you what we're looking at here.

1123
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
Well, Justin, Justin, let me stop you right there.

1124
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm kind of a healthy boy, so I'm pretty sure I know

1125
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,120
what we're dealing with vis-a-vis salads.

1126
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah, you don't.

1127
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,560
Yeah, okay.

1128
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,480
So we got Classic Garden, Chicken Caesar, and a new Chicken Apple Pecan.

1129
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,520
Those are the three salads.

1130
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,840
That sounds good as fuck.

1131
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,240
I do want to point out to you guys, just so you all can see-

1132
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah, show me a JPEG of these sweet salads.

1133
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,920
Let me just give you the one JPEG from this press release.

1134
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,320
I do want to point out, I get a big kick out of the fact

1135
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,680
that they've depicted these salads with plastic forks

1136
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,360
sitting on like a kitchen tray.

1137
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,240
Oh, that's great, because sometimes you always think like,

1138
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,640
yeah, but it's not really going to look like that when I get it.

1139
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:24,960
Yeah, this is it.

1140
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,800
This is all photograph magic.

1141
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,360
They kind of shot those salads from the Hubble Space Telescope, just to give you-

1142
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,720
Here's a quote from Joe Jordan, chief marketing officer at Domino's.

1143
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,400
He quote, now everybody can be happy on pizza night.

1144
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
There's no shame in wanting salad when everyone else wants pizza,

1145
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,560
especially now that Domino's has found a perfect way

1146
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,520
to offer even more options for customers across the country.

1147
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,880
Yo, dog, a salad.

1148
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,080
Hey, dog, that salad, it was the first food people ever ate.

1149
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,920
We've done it.

1150
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,320
We saw-

1151
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,240
Get in here. Get in here. Get in here.

1152
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,960
We've done it.

1153
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,840
We saw like fucking hippos doing it.

1154
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,680
And we were like, let's give that shit a try.

1155
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,400
Thanks, hippos.

1156
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,360
I just love this mythos that they created.

1157
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,040
People are like, hey, you guys want to get pizza?

1158
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,320
And there's one guy going, hmm, what is it, damn?

1159
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,040
Nothing.

1160
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
The fucking sad thing about this is, this is 100% on point.

1161
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,720
There usually is one person that did not want pizza.

1162
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,800
Sure, but then you just, nobody orders pizza.

1163
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
You don't just go, sorry, Greg, you don't get to eat today.

1164
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,680
Do you want a salad?

1165
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
Those are your two options.

1166
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,800
To finish Jordan's quote, the new chicken apple pecan option

1167
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
may even lure a few pizza lovers over to the salad side.

1168
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,280
Are we choosing sides now?

1169
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,040
That's a risky business practice.

1170
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,800
That's a fucking crazy, if this is what pizza executives think,

1171
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,240
that people are like, well, I don't know.

1172
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,920
He either eats pizza or a salad.

1173
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,400
Yeah.

1174
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,720
And then there might be someone who's like, what's that green stuff?

1175
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,880
I've been eating pizza discs this whole time.

1176
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,920
I didn't know there was greens.

1177
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,480
Can I try it?

1178
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,920
This is good.

1179
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,520
We're thrilled that our salads are now available for Domino's customers

1180
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,760
in every store, said Tristan Simpson,

1181
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,240
chief marketing officer at Ready Packed Foods.

1182
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
By the way, these are prepackaged salads.

1183
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,000
It literally says that in the press release.

1184
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,560
I didn't need to know that, but thank you for your honesty.

1185
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,840
Everyone who loves pizza night can now breathe a sigh of relief

1186
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,680
and enjoy Domino's classic garden salad with that slice of pizza.

1187
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,120
Okay, so Tristan Simpson, Joe Jordan broke down the barrier between pizza and salad.

1188
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Pick a side, wield a knife and protect the fucking homeland.

1189
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,000
I am a salad.

1190
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
I have no issue with the idea of like,

1191
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,320
hey, with your pizza, you should also get some salad.

1192
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,960
Yeah.

1193
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,440
I don't know how hard you have to sell that.

1194
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,680
Yeah.

1195
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,920
Like we offer vegetables now.

1196
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,520
Vegetables, huh?

1197
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,960
We invented vegetables.

1198
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,760
Here's the press release.

1199
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,720
Domino's salads are available for $5.99 each.

1200
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,720
When you pair them with any one of Domino's mix and match menu items,

1201
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,280
which also include medium two topping pizzas.

1202
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,680
Hey, thanks for clarifying press release

1203
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,440
that I can still secure a medium two topping pizza at Domino's.

1204
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
I'm glad to hear that menu item is still available.

1205
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,000
We're getting out of the pizza business.

1206
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,360
Picture this commercial.

1207
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,800
Hey, you guys want salad night?

1208
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,440
Salad?

1209
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,000
Salad?

1210
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, but where would we order salad for delivery?

1211
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,720
Just a second.

1212
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,240
Domino's?

1213
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,920
And the answer is actually no, you have to order them with pizza.

1214
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,200
We'll also take a pizza, but then you just throw the pizza right in the garbage.

1215
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,760
So that's sounding great.

1216
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,800
How about a yahoo?

1217
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,280
Hit me.

1218
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm so sorry to just keep doing this to you guys,

1219
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,040
but Jack Nicholson or Bruce Willis.

1220
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,920
Right, that's top of shit.

1221
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,440
This is final Jeopardy time.

1222
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,560
Do you remember when fucking A-Kutch took Demi Moore to some event

1223
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
and B-Willis was like there with him

1224
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,920
basically chaperoning his ex-wife's exploits with A plus K?

1225
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,320
Just like scoping out his scene.

1226
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,080
And do you remember the look on Bruce Willis' face?

1227
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,840
And now imagine just a big old wrench

1228
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,160
just going in that, just a big old monkey wrench.

1229
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,360
This is what I picture.

1230
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,080
Just a big old smokey, just flashlight going right in that big old mouth.

1231
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,520
You look at Bruce Willis for a long time, like 10, 15 minutes.

1232
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
And he's just stone face, doesn't move.

1233
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,600
And then after 15 minutes, he opens his mouth.

1234
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,000
And a fucking fucking genie from Aladdin comes out that mouth.

1235
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,880
When did he?

1236
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,680
Hold on, I've been looking at him this whole time.

1237
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,960
So like, when did he?

1238
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,440
What?

1239
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Yeah, we can all see Bruno with a big rig.

1240
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,680
Yeah, but there's one problem though.

1241
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,040
And that's me, Jacko, over here with my rig.

1242
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,840
This vape is as good as it gets.

1243
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,120
Have you ever danced with the devil?

1244
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,480
And you, Jack,

1245
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,600
cotton, cotton, cotton, cotton.

1246
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,360
Just huge waves of it.

1247
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,520
I think I want to jack it up to 20 ohms.

1248
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,680
You can't handle 20 ohms.

1249
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,760
Only I can with my special illegal celebrity rig.

1250
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,280
That's what makes me so fucking.

1251
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
That's what makes me so fucking angry about all this.

1252
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,480
As you know, they're working with illegal underground celebrity rigs.

1253
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,280
Okay, I got a hurdle for you, Garth Brooks or Chris Gaines.

1254
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,600
Garth Brooks or Chris Gaines, which one rips it?

1255
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,480
Which one vapes?

1256
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,440
Here's my thing.

1257
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,680
I think Chris Gaines vapes too hard and dies.

1258
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,080
And that's why we don't get from him.

1259
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,920
Here's the interesting thing, Justin.

1260
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,120
Garth Brooks only inhales and Chris Gaines only exhales.

1261
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,280
If you see him exhaling, he's Chris Gaines.

1262
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,600
My dad, our dad interviewed Garth Brooks on Thursday and it is that I,

1263
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,520
we fucking begged him to just bring up CG once.

1264
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,320
Wouldn't do it.

1265
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,400
Just, is Chris there?

1266
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,080
Can I speak with Chris?

1267
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,760
Can I speak with Chris?

1268
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,320
Is Chris inside for me to talk to Garth?

1269
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,280
That's a good one.

1270
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,360
No, this is Robert Downey Jr. versus Christian Bale.

1271
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,200
I don't think either of those boys do it.

1272
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,760
I don't think.

1273
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,960
Birds do it.

1274
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,320
Bees do it.

1275
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
But RDJ doesn't do it.

1276
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,240
I would, I would give you RDJ does not.

1277
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Griffin gave me shit earlier this episode.

1278
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,480
It was positive.

1279
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,640
You didn't hear about staring at my computer.

1280
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,280
Now, Griffin's just staring at his computer,

1281
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,680
generating random celebrities and asking which one vapes.

1282
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,720
It's just fun to think about.

1283
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,000
Tyler Perry probably vapes.

1284
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,560
Brennan Frazier.

1285
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,080
Oh my god.

1286
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,400
He's got a full blown bagpipe set up.

1287
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,320
Multiple in points.

1288
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,880
Multiple juice relays.

1289
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,000
Vapesino man.

1290
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,840
Do you think Pauly Shore's into vape?

1291
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,560
Probably.

1292
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,280
Audrey Hepburn would crush a vape.

1293
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,240
How about this one from Kiba Davey Morgan Davey.

1294
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,720
Thank you.

1295
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,480
It's from Yahoo Answers user crazy.

1296
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,600
And I just want to, guys, I think it's time that we talk about some nerd stuff for the geek crowd.

1297
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:39,840
Yeah.

1298
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Hey, hey, hey, are you nerd boys?

1299
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,920
Hey, nerd boys.

1300
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,160
Where, where are my geeks at?

1301
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,360
Hey, any comic book fans?

1302
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,320
Where's my comic, where's my comic fans at?

1303
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,920
Hey, we're looking for some listeners that didn't fit in with the jocks.

1304
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,480
Here comes one.

1305
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,240
It's actually, it's pretty mainstream now, you guys.

1306
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,040
It's just, it's for everybody.

1307
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,200
Here's one for the comic bookers.

1308
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,240
Well, I mean like everybody like.

1309
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,480
Here's for, here's one for the dweeboids.

1310
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,160
For like everybody, because it's for everybody.

1311
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,760
It's from Yahoo Answers user crazy, who asks,

1312
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:19,520
where does Aquaman piss?

1313
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Where does Aquaman piss?

1314
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,720
I would like, I would like to make for you a scenario.

1315
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,920
You're laying on the beach.

1316
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,320
Yeah.

1317
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,000
You just enjoy, maybe this is your week, your first weekend off all summer.

1318
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,160
And you're like, we're taking the kids to the beach.

1319
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,360
Aquaman walks up on the beach and you're like, honey, it's Aquaman.

1320
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,560
And he just whips his dong out, and then he gets back into the water.

1321
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,320
If you say Aquaman just pisses wherever in the ocean, it's not a big deal.

1322
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,440
That would be tantamount to me, just like pulling down now, the only, just the underwear,

1323
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,200
which is the only thing I'm wearing right now.

1324
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,800
The only thing keeping brothers apart.

1325
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,120
And just sort of blasting one up into the sky where we live in this house.

1326
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,760
No, that is not where Aquaman do it.

1327
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,280
That is not where Aquaman do it.

1328
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,920
Do you think he's designated a corner of the ocean?

1329
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,440
Designated a corner of the ocean where all the fish are allowed to go?

1330
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,080
Or he's just like, all this, this is our house.

1331
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,440
So this is the bathroom of the house.

1332
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,720
He probably is a gentleman.

1333
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,920
He probably gets to the Arctic Ocean because like, nobody's getting in there.

1334
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,960
Oh, but it's so cold.

1335
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,320
I think I have an answer.

1336
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,440
Okay, here comes Justin's scientific explanation.

1337
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,600
Where do Aquaman do that dirty thing?

1338
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,840
He gets his, he gets his zippoc baggy.

1339
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,240
Okay.

1340
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,040
Then he goes to the surface and he fills it with air.

1341
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,160
And then he goes back down to the bottom of the ocean.

1342
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,000
Oh, like in a water world.

1343
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,680
So he goes up on the ocean.

1344
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,720
He pisses into this bag that is also full of air, right?

1345
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,600
So he's displacing air and filling it with piss, right?

1346
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,880
And then he seals it up.

1347
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,000
This checks out so far.

1348
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,800
So far so good.

1349
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,840
He seals it up real quick and then he just lets it go.

1350
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,480
And because it's mainly filled with air, he floats up to the surface.

1351
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,200
And that's flushing.

1352
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,240
He calls it wishes.

1353
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,080
Those are wishes that he's sending out.

1354
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,280
And that's where jellyfish come from.

1355
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,560
That's where jellyfish come from.

1356
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,560
Their backs are pissed at Aquaman but go to the surface.

1357
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,680
Where does he do it though?

1358
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,720
He probably gets out of the ocean and goes to earth toilet.

1359
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,360
What's Aquaman?

1360
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,040
Hey, can I tell you guys something?

1361
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,200
I like to consider myself, you know, one of the, like a nerd.

1362
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,760
I don't know nothing about Aquaman.

1363
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
I don't know anything about Aquaman.

1364
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,840
I know he talks to fish.

1365
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,640
He lives in the ocean.

1366
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,840
He loves Aqua.

1367
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,360
But he probably, is he from earth first and he fell in the ocean one day

1368
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,680
and just some whales were like, you're ours now.

1369
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,200
Because if that's the case, then he probably knows about toilets and what's up with them.

1370
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,680
But if he was born in the ocean, he's lived there his whole life.

1371
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,080
Where do Ariel, where does Ariel and all the mermaids piss?

1372
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,200
Where do fish piss?

1373
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,240
Like Ariel doesn't, Ariel doesn't piss.

1374
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,040
Fish piss through their skin.

1375
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,680
King Triton.

1376
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,080
King Triton pisses for sure.

1377
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,560
You think King Triton pisses?

1378
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,360
I love that, listen, I don't want to get blue.

1379
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,400
But I love that this question has her super worried about number one.

1380
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,160
I'm way more worried about the twosies are a doozy.

1381
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,240
I'm pretty sure that Aquaman can't shit.

1382
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,280
What's he eat?

1383
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,760
Krill?

1384
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,200
Probably not even krill, right?

1385
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,480
Is he a filter feeder?

1386
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,040
Aquaman just slims with his mouth open.

1387
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,800
Hey guys, fuck it.

1388
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,480
Where does Spider-Man piss?

1389
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,000
We don't, I don't think, have you guys ever, I've read a few comic books in my day.

1390
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,120
I've never seen a panel etched by Jack Kirby who's like, and now, of course, it's been a while.

1391
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,120
Spider-Man's been doing a lot of adventures.

1392
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,160
He just fought off the rhino and we had a lot of fun here, but it's been a long time.

1393
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,480
So yeah, Spider-Man's got to go piss now.

1394
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:46,000
What if every 20 issues of Superman, on the 20th one, it's just like 30 frames of him going,

1395
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,440
ahhh, someone's in, someone's in, hurry.

1396
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,960
I don't hear anybody.

1397
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,520
Come on now.

1398
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,520
Who's moving me up?

1399
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,480
No, there's no way that Superman can push it.

1400
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,240
There was never a bathroom scene in 24.

1401
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,880
Was there ever a bathroom scene in the movie?

1402
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,840
It's too busy.

1403
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,920
Sometimes you get really busy and it just, like,

1404
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,320
reabsorbs back into your organs and muscles and stuff.

1405
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,720
That can happen sometimes.

1406
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,960
I feel like what if there was what if there's an episode of 24 where you had diarrhea all day

1407
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,640
What if they're what if I had an episode 24 from the last time we recorded the podcast my brother my brother and me

1408
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,280
Just all diarrhea the whole time and I I wouldn't be a featured player in that season

1409
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,220
I don't certainly not I would definitely during the countdown sequences where they would cut back from commercial. I'd be in a corner. Just like

1410
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:38,460
I would love it. There was just constant shots of Jack trying to call Griffin and the phone buzzing just like a city

1411
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,780
Screaming like

1412
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Where does Aquaman do that, but listen guys listen

1413
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,340
Does he pissed do you think he has like a coral toilet

1414
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,660
Do you think that he has a toilet that was like in a down submarine or something?

1415
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,320
He was like, thank God. Oh, that's probably it

1416
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,180
Probably an old you boat and he runs and he sees a bunch of Nazi skeletons. He's like suckers

1417
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,660
I've got to use the gotta use the John

1418
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,100
This is Jack Cousteau. I have found my greatest discovery ever

1419
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Um, I actually think I've gone too deep on this one. This is a I found a sub filled with bits

1420
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,980
I don't know where to start. I don't know where to start with this one guys. Usually the ocean is a bountiful

1421
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,420
bountiful

1422
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:36,180
There's a mystery. There's a mystery. There's piss. This is something with piss. I'm pretty sure Aquaman did it but he's crazy

1423
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:41,340
Well, I retire. Well, this is it for me. This is it. This is that I am breaking up with the ocean

1424
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:48,620
Next up we're checking out Jack Cousteau's fields. I just go to fields and see what's going on

1425
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:56,140
Uh, should we wrap up you think yes. Yes. I'm gonna try I'm trying to get it. Fuck

1426
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,020
Find a good one and it's a good one Justin

1427
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:07,120
Griffin I think everybody's pretty tired of this game. Oh, are they I think this is the best fucking game like ever

1428
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,260
We've played some fun games here. This has been the first interactive episode of my bim-bam because you could get a high score on this episode

1429
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,520
Okay

1430
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,420
Martin Sheen

1431
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,880
President Josiah Bartlett from the West Wing or Tommy Lee Jones

1432
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
Shit

1433
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,420
Martin Sheen seems like kind of a hippie

1434
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,180
Yeah

1435
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,900
But let me paint you a picture Justin imagine this scene in the tooth

1436
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,380
Cathedrals is I think the episode and rather than just lighten up a cigarette in the middle of the church

1437
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:46,780
He just pulls out a sweet-ass steampunk themed vape rig. He snaps his rig over his knee and throws it on the presidential seal

1438
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Are you happy God?

1439
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,900
God

1440
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,460
That's how I quit vaping was cursing God's name at a funeral

1441
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:02,500
Just so you know for the future yeah boy crime, I don't know is where

1442
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,620
I decided to kick your ass

1443
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,580
Waves of cotton

1444
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:20,900
Dolores Lanningham died in a car crash because their whole cab was filled with cotton. I learned it from watching you

1445
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,860
Well, mr. President one thing you could do to help you relieve your stress

1446
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,380
Cut some huge cotton sheets from that mouth of yours

1447
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,380
That's one thing

1448
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,900
I'm never so is this

1449
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,860
Here something said as Dolores Lanningham Toby. I need you to buy me a new vape rig here you go mr. President

1450
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,020
I found one good. I want you to take my old vape rig. It's been passed down from my family

1451
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,820
Daniel Boone first made this vape rig

1452
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,860
Out of a dog's bone and now it's yours

1453
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,020
Cotton cotton cotton treasure it

1454
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,580
Jed what are you thinking about?

1455
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:12,500
Cotton that's the last word in the series. You remember that fucking touched me. God. I love West Wing. Yeah, it's a good show

1456
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,380
This has been my brother my brother of me

1462
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,440
So maybe that will balance out how tired we are that you can get little sneak peeks at what the show is gonna be now

1463
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,440
This show will not be out for a while

1464
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,500
But we want to give you a little sneak peeks about ahead of time. So check out the Instagram account

1465
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,140
I want to say thanks to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song

1466
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:55,420
It's a departure off the album winning the days to bed. We just added a new show to make some fun

1467
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:00,460
Called the dead pilot society and it's spearheaded by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker

1468
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,540
Who you may know is one of the writers and creators of thrilling adventure hour

1469
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,860
Episode one just went up and it's called its Formosa

1470
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,980
It's a pilot written by Thomas Lennon and Rob Ben Garant

1471
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,500
who you may know from Reno 911 and the state and a ton of really amazing shit and

1472
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:21,740
They take pilots that never made it to air and they have them performed by a pretty kick-ass cast

1473
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,060
This first one has Paul F. Tompkins Ben Schwartz Craig Kukowski Janet Varney

Seriously, thank you all for sticking with us. I I know this has been

1477
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:43,100
Maybe an exhausting one to listen to we're working really hard to try and make a good television show for you

1478
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,940
And I'm really really excited about what we've made and I don't want to make it sound like we're not having a good time

1479
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,660
Making the TV show we're having an excellent excellent time, but it is fucking so much work. It is a lot

1480
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:57,400
It's it's tough. Um, and we're gonna keep the podcast going though and keep it coming out for you

1481
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:02,280
Again, this is probably out late and I apologize for that the last one came out. I think a day late

1482
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,980
So we'll try and get this one up on time. And yeah, thank you all so much Griffin. Do you have one more question for us?

1483
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,420
