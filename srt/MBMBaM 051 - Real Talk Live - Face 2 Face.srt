1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,080
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,520
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,520
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:49,440
Travis is prepping for our live show, which we've, we've subtitled, uh, My Brother, My

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,840
Brother and Me, real talk live, face to face.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
The number two, otherwise.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,480
Hi, this is My Brother, My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the modern era, like

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:10,440
Chilean minors emerging from the depths of, uh, no, no, no, no, can we, can we drink in

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
here?

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Yeah.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Yeah.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Try to stop us.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
I can't.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
They don't want that on the record.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm gonna move Jesse's computer here.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,800
So hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm your oldest brother.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Uh, I'm Travis McElroy.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm the middle-est brother.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,240
I'm the youngest brother, and my mic's turned on, which means I win.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
What?

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Like you, D-Net.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Am I on?

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
You sound good.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Speak noisy.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
I don't know.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Fucking killer start.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
So here's what we do.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,840
We, uh, we take your questions, uh, and turn them out, coming like into wisdom.

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,400
We've asked some of the people who are going to be here tonight to submit questions, uh,

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,360
wisdom that they need, uh, delivered unto them.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
Uh, we also have some questions from the Yahoo Answers Service, but let's start with, uh,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
one of these right now.

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
First...

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Before, before we begin.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Yeah.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Do you guys have any, like, goals or...

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Goals you wanna...

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Like, any wishes, any hopes and dreams for this?

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Just for the live show?

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
My, my only goal...

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Whoa.

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I don't care if it's funny or not.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Um...

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
I mean, I really have their money.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
You're really up on that mic.

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
You're really...

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Getting a taste, huh?

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I gotta eat it.

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Like, more of the taste of chrome.

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,320
I can't perform without chrome in my mouth.

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,920
My only goal is, I hope, that...

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Still.

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
He hopes you can hear his mustache.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,520
I want you to feel the bristles of my face against your face.

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
What's it like to kiss Griffin?

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,140
This is what it's like.

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,000
My only goal...

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,400
I've got a new goal to change since we started, but go ahead.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,720
I just don't want my balls to come out of my pants, so...

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
I don't know how it would happen.

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I would shift...

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm wearing jeans.

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
It would require some physics.

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
They'll never know.

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
There's like a...

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Put some English.

72
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Your money.

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
You're good.

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Yeah.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I actually...

76
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
I developed a fear slash goal.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
What's that?

78
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
And that is...

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,960
No one can ever see it, including these guys, because we record in different places, but

80
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
when I'm at home, if I'm thinking of a joke, my face goes to this.

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Or like a solid...

82
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
For the majority of the show?

83
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Yeah.

84
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Like...

85
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
For those listening who are downloading the show later, I would liken it to a caveman.

86
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah.

87
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
I call it dead face.

88
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Okay.

89
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Because it's like...

90
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Yeah.

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,920
And then I come back with a joke, and I need to not do that in front of all you guys.

92
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,200
That's a preview for Travis' Wake.

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,320
That's that gallows humor.

94
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,360
I would just like to not be super racist.

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Like if I dip my toe into some mild racism, that would be fine.

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,360
I edit every podcast, and in every episode, sure enough, there's one tiny little tidbit.

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,920
Usually, you have to look to find it.

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Like where's Waldo?

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,000
Only instead of Waldo, it's like a racist question.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,200
We usually record like three hours of material, and then put out an hour-long show.

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
I express this fear to my wife, who's here.

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Is she here?

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Is she somewhere?

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Hey.

105
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Hey, everybody.

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,800
It's my wife, Sydney, and my dad, Clint, our dad, shared dad, our co-dad, Clint.

107
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,480
I express this fear to my wife.

108
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,520
She called it pulling a Kramer, which if my career can be summed up that way...

109
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,280
This is our first live show, which is not the best time to pull a Kramer.

110
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,080
You don't want to pull a Kramer.

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Because this is our first live show, I want to take a second to apologize for the fact...

112
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
I don't hear myself.

113
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Is it really that loud?

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
No, you're still good.

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
I need more monitor burning.

116
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
I want to apologize, because this is what we look like.

117
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Sorry, everybody.

118
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,000
I feel like we adopted some handsome radio voices from our father, who's a radio professional,

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but...

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is it.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, you're getting...

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where's Eric?

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Is Eric here?

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Eric?

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can you raise your hand?

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Eric from Chicago.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good one, Eric.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Way to narrow it down, Eric.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,960
Well, Eric asked us a question about paintball.

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,440
He said, at my corporate job, there was recently a call for suggestions for team-building activities.

131
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I propose paintball since it's a team game and can use the products we make, radios,

132
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
while playing.

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
The boss really liked it.

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
We're going to do it this summer.

135
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Here's where I need advice.

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,880
I actually proposed this idea because it would give me free reign to shoot my coworkers in

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,880
the dick with paintballs, potentially consequence-free.

138
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,760
Would it be uncouth to go on a dick-shooting rampage at a corporate team-building event,

139
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,760
or should I go ahead with my plan of dick destruction because, hey, it's part of the

140
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
game?

141
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Eric?

142
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,120
Eric, first off, I think you have some misconceptions about paintball.

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,720
I haven't played paintball in a while, but I don't remember it being just like a campaign

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
for impotence.

145
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,720
And what's all this pent-up dick rage?

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
You really are angry at your coworkers' dicks.

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,360
There's a lot of places you can shoot with a paintball gun on a person's body that's

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
going to hurt.

149
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,840
You don't have to aim straight for the dick.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
Yeah, not right for the dick.

151
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,720
I think you can probably, Eric, we can give you permission to do this, but I think that

152
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,000
it's going to come down to a question of fortitude.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,400
If you've got your boss's dick in lacrosse hairs, can you pull the trigger, release the

154
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,560
CO2, and just fucking fire that red spot of, like, I mean, it's insubordination, right?

155
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,080
Yeah, because that's not going to come up in the performance review, but it's going

156
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
to be there in the background.

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah, like, if the performance review were a play, the backdrop would be a picture of

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,000
him, you shooting him in the wiener, like, he's not going to let it slide.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,360
Also, it's not just about can you do it, but can you do it?

160
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Like, do you have the accuracy required to really just get right in there and shoot him

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,320
square in the dick, because, first of all, you're going to need to know the parameters

162
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,080
of said dick, which, good luck acquiring that information.

163
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,400
We're going to need some heavy recon before this paintball game.

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,200
He gets his own performance review, like, what are you working with down there?

165
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,440
Eric was really worried about shooting all of us in the dick, but he spent most of the

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
time just firing at walls.

167
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,680
You could ask the measurements of his dick, because you could tell him that you don't

168
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:15,800
want to shoot him in the dick, so you need to know which area not to aim for.

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Can you paint your dick with some neon green, something just to help me avoid...

170
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,040
Of course, a tiny orange hat on the top.

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Don't get it twisted.

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Don't get it twisted.

173
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't get it twisted, Raphael.

174
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm just going to shoot around...

175
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
He works at the Ninja Turtles.

176
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I forgot to...

177
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,720
What I'm saying, if you shoot your boss in, like, the upper thigh or the mom's pubis,

178
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,320
you're going to get in an equal amount of trouble, and you're not going to get that

179
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,120
sweet satisfaction you'll get from a killer dick shot.

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
You want to feel it.

181
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Griffin, do we have any yahoos?

182
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
We have so many yahoos.

183
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
This one we found.

184
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
It wasn't sent in by anybody.

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Which is where...

186
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
What?

187
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
It was actually sent in by...

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
What now?

189
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,680
We'll still get down there in the dirt with you people and fucking dig around.

190
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,720
We have a basic understanding of how the internet works.

191
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Yeah.

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
Google schmoo, I say.

193
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Justin actually found this one.

194
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Is this your first...

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
It's a treasure trove.

196
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
You never really...

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
You don't have to be like that.

198
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
It doesn't have to be like that.

199
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
No, I'm saying...

200
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,760
In case anyone doesn't know, Justin contributes nothing until this moment.

201
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
So like this.

202
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Here it is.

203
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Ready?

204
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,560
And I turn it on, and they get, like, 50 minutes, and then off.

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,600
I don't even remember the show exists.

206
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,520
This question was asked by Carly, who asks, where can I hire an elf impersonator for my

207
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,640
b-day party?

208
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,160
I am going all out this year and throwing myself a b-day party.

209
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm an elf fanatic.

210
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I think we could have assumed...

211
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah.

212
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm cool on elf.

213
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm a minor elf enthusiast.

214
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:53,400
I bought my three friends three gifts to give me.

215
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,400
An elf lunchbox, an elf alarm clock, and an elf rock star action figure with guitar and

216
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,240
posable arms.

217
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Let it sink in, okay?

218
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Let it sink in.

219
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,360
All I need is an elf impersonator.

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Where can I find this?

221
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I would say, first and foremost, you need a few more things than just an elf impersonator.

222
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,240
I can think of 25 things off the top of my head that you need before you need an elf

223
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
impersonator.

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm going to throw out this person has three friends.

225
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,280
Who apparently does not understand her penchant for elf.

226
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
They couldn't think, like, what's Carly all about?

227
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,220
Alf, I think.

228
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,800
That's maybe what you should base your gifts on.

229
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,280
So tell me about this birthday party you're taking me to, Danny.

230
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah, it's going to be cool.

231
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,520
The guy's really nice.

232
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,080
There's this one thing.

233
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,840
Just a heads up.

234
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Just a heads up.

235
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,040
If someone brings up Gordon Shumway, just roll with it.

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
He's a fan.

237
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Welcome to Melmac.

238
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,440
We are not being particularly helpful.

239
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
You're right.

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Where can they find an elf impersonator?

241
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,200
What's the number one?

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,280
Is there an accepted answer from the Yahoo!

243
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Answer service?

244
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,720
Well, I'm reading, I don't know if you can see this, I'm reading off a piece of paper.

245
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I don't have that information.

246
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,600
I remember it because I looked it up, number one answer.

247
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
The Midget Store.

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
No, that's it.

249
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,880
No, you guys laugh, but that's an excellent point because if you get an elf that is like

250
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,640
you get eye to eye with an elf, like he's the height of a full grown man, like you will,

251
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,520
that's a terrible, I can't imagine anything scarier than that in my mind than a six foot

252
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
tall elf.

253
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,080
You don't think like the whole situation is just terrifying in general?

254
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,360
I think the whole situation is terrifying in general, but for...

255
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,480
No, see I thought this too.

256
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
Elf expanded to six feet tall, horrifying, but not as horrifying as that moment when

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,960
you reach for the punch and you're like, whoa, elf, right there.

258
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,200
There's a whole emporium of oddly sized like 80s sitcom star impersonators.

259
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:13,560
Could we make this like a giant Webster, like horrifyingly gigantic wonders.

260
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
With killing power.

261
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,160
She's a robot, but with killing power.

262
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, she's basically...

263
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,280
She's still cute as a button, but she's nine feet tall.

264
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
She's sweet as pie.

265
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,400
Her arm does spin around and become a machine gun.

266
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
She's a darling though.

267
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,040
She's fucked up to Skynet, but otherwise a real sweetheart.

268
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:40,760
I think that if you are a midget, a little person, who does birthday parties...

269
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,040
If you are an elf impersonator, you don't care.

270
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
You've got the suit, right?

271
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,760
Like you've got the suit in your house.

272
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,160
There can't be enough of those just rolling around that...

273
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Call me what you will.

274
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I need the money real bad.

275
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,920
Is this guy going to be able to handle meeting elf in person?

276
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Is this guy going to be able to handle the pressure?

277
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
I'm like, I couldn't...

278
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I am Starstruck.

279
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:10,280
Oh yeah, let me pause at another question.

280
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,520
Can we just get the real elf?

281
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
What's he up to?

282
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,520
What has elf been in since elf?

283
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:25,680
Oh, fucking stupid elf.

284
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
He's got to be doing something, right?

285
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Somewhere there's a room you could walk into and there would be elves hanging from the

286
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
ceiling.

287
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Deal with that reality.

288
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,320
Let's just like dead-eyed looking right at you.

289
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,280
We were talking about this backstage, actually.

290
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Just rapping about elf.

291
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,640
How fucked up is it that elf's real name is Gordon Shumway?

292
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,720
Do people still call him Alf?

293
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
Like he told them his real ass name, right?

294
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Like, hi, I'm Gordon.

295
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Oh, Alf.

296
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,960
That's just shorthand bigotry is what that is.

297
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah, Alf is his slave name, basically.

298
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
That's what you're saying to me.

299
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I'll edit that out later.

300
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Fuck.

301
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Fuck.

302
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,280
You know, a lot of people don't know this.

303
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
LeVar Burton played elf.

304
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
That's true.

305
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
That's true.

306
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
That's true.

307
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
You laugh.

308
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
It's true.

309
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Your accent is fascinating.

310
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,720
Not just a blind man, also an extraterrestrial with a real taste for kiddies.

311
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I am...

312
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Is Jacque here?

313
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Jacque?

314
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Hi, Jacque.

315
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Jacque.

316
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Jacque.

317
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,840
Jacque asks us I'm writing on behalf of my BFF Ally B. Her boyfriend feels really uncomfortable

318
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,560
in neckties and bowties.

319
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,240
He doesn't like to wear them but still wants to look classy when attending dress-up style

320
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,720
events such as weddings or charity balls what are some great tie alternatives

321
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,520
that's from Jacqueline you picked it of the two podcasts that are performing

322
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,000
tonight you picked the best one I think yeah who you go to fashion advice the

323
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,720
guys who all showed up with the exact same jacket had to switch last minute

324
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,880
Travis check it off no yeah Travis took his jacket off real tall. I think we can all agree, all agree.

325
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:17,400
Ebola tie. Are you an up-and-coming oil magnate? I think if I see a guy in Ebola tie I know it's

326
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,600
time to party like yeah if that guy makes that bolo tie choice shit might go

327
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,320
down shit might not go down I want to be with that guy yeah what is what is the

328
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,400
utility of Ebola tie what is it what is it holding together? It's like an ID badge it's like saying I'm the Swiss army knife of people

329
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,800
no matter what circumstance comes up I got it. You need clothing accessories with

330
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,280
real cow skulls on them I'm your guy. I think a great alternative is just the

331
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,640
open top button. You think? Yeah because that says like I'm not gonna constrain your

332
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,340
rules I'm not gonna follow whatever laws you set forth before. I go with the

333
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,280
office party look where it's I was wearing a tie it might have been up

334
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:08,360
later but right now I'm down it's margarita let's do this. What about pet

335
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:17,560
snake? What if it was a corn snake that you turned into Ebola tie? I would wear

336
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,080
that I would sport that look. Griffey got any more yahoos? Sure. I know you do. I saw

337
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,560
the list. I do. This one was sent in by Jacob Locker. Is he here? I don't think he

338
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,520
is. He's the greatest. He's the greatest person. Thank you Jacob Locker it's by

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,160
yahoo answers user Megan Curtis who asks perplexingly how can I get back at

340
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,040
my mom without putting pizza crust in my butt?

341
00:15:46,040 --> 00:16:02,240
That's the only way I know like that exists. When I'm mad at her I stick pizza

342
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,040
crust in my butt so she'll have to take me to the hospital. How many times could

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,040
that be effective? Once maybe twice and then it's like you got this. How can I

344
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,840
get back at her without having to do this? Megan Curtis. Do you think after like three

345
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,040
times the mom starts going just start doing heroin? The little boy who

346
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,440
cried there's pizza crust in my ass. I think if your mom has had more than once

347
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,680
scoop you up in her arms like her baby boy take you to the ER and and show you

348
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,240
to the doctor and hold you up like Simba and say yeah you're fucking

349
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,640
gotten back you there's no shit she can do where you're you have not gotten back

350
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,440
in advance at her. You've gotten back as hard as you're gonna get back. Why hasn't the mom stopped buying pizza?

351
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:05,800
For the very least go with thin crust. God damn it this DiGiorno deal is just so good. You see you see the Papa

352
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,640
John's guy pull up outside and you start running through your mind like what the fuck did I do?

353
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,760
Did we fight? What could he be mad about? I gave him back his Akon tape I don't

354
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,600
know what his problem is. I let him listen to Beastie Boys at all hours. Like of all the

355
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,240
ways to inconvenience your parents to teach them a lesson I think making them

356
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,280
take you to the hospital I think is one of the worst ways to do it especially

357
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,320
when the toll to do so is sticking. If anyone listening to this right now is

358
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:42,000
considering this mode of getting back your parents. A. Kill yourself. B. Your parents might react

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,840
strongly in the moment then they're gonna have a glass of wine later and

360
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,560
look at each other and go what did we do? Our son's a pizza file freak. And then

361
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,680
they're gonna giggle. I giggle. Hey and by the way pizza guy like we get it we

362
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,160
know what's up. You're not mad at your mom. You like to put some pizza crust.

363
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,040
The sexiest of all the Italian foods. Talk about stuff trust.

364
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,840
We were all thinking. Thank you. The voice of the people.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,640
That was good. I do that when no one can see. That's all I had written down.

366
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,760
We're down for pizza crust riffing if you want to move on. Is that all the pizza

367
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,040
is all the pizza crust gags? Those are all our notes. Is a musically minded in the

368
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,960
Midwest here? Musically minded in the Midwest? Hey hey right there. That's a weird name.

369
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,600
That's a weird name. I bet I bet after you got that name you put some pizza

370
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,960
crust in your butt. I meant it. How do my wife and I convince our eight-year-old

371
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,520
son that piano lessons are awesome and not nerdy? When we told him we want to

372
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,320
take him to take piano lessons he told us he only knows one kid that takes

373
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,960
piano lessons and that they are a huge liability to his reputation.

374
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,840
Grew up so fast. We want him to inherit the same love of music that our parents

375
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,480
gave us. Help us brothers. How old is the kid? Eight. Eight years old? How's he supposed to

376
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,840
front in the Pokemon League? How's your rep? What's your rep like? Like what kind

377
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,080
of rep do you have at age eight? Yeah man he's probably trained three four

378
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,000
years he doesn't give a shit. He does I mean he does but it's in the potty.

379
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,080
There's a lot of really fuck like you show all the manly poonhound pianists

380
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,240
out there you like your Elton John's your Liberace's give those those role

381
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:56,360
models there to look look for and or Billy Joel. I could name ten nerdier instruments off the top of my head like if you want to give that kid flugelhorn lessons then he's in

382
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,320
for a world of hurt but I think a piano yeah you can make him take flugelhorn

383
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,880
lessons and then give him the option to do piano. I've been practicing my

384
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,560
theremin for three months I'm ready to switch I think. I just got beat up in the in

385
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,400
the at eight years old. Well on the other hand though if he gets like super

386
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,520
talented and he has playing some tinder jams for for you know ladies once that

387
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,080
becomes a thing or dudes or fellas then the problem is piano and the reason I

388
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,680
switched from piano to guitar not the real reason I did but for the purpose of

389
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,920
this podcast I'll say it is. I can't carry a piano around to play in the quad to try and get trim.

390
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:45,120
You can but it's massively unpleasant. It's super fucking heavy and so it's it's hard to be on your

391
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,920
game when you're carrying a two-ton baby grand around yeah hey Griffin what are

392
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,360
you doing I'm trying to get some trim uh why why are you that you're so sweaty

393
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,240
and you you have three moving guys with you. That's the problem though. It's expensive but it

394
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,640
works. Have you thought about keytar? It's like all the beauty of a piano but

395
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,560
with the portability of a guitar. Yeah your eight-year-old should be really

396
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:18,440
into that. Don't listen to Travis. So hopefully that should help Griffin. You

397
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,320
know what I need. I do. Okay here this one was sent in by Kieran D. Thank you

398
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,400
Kieran D. This one was asked by there's a bug get out of here by Jay Jenkins who

399
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,880
asks wait for the radio for people who are listening later there was a bug

400
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,920
there was a bug it was super big and scary. Griffin wasn't riffing like that

401
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:47,120
was a there was a bug. Jay Jenkins asks I have two urethras any

402
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,080
information? I noticed this a few days ago but when I used the restroom I peed

403
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,960
two different ways and when I pulled my foreskin back I can't say that I don't

404
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,760
gotta cut that out. When I pulled back and looked at the tip I had two

405
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,480
completely separate urethras. How common is this and are there any advantages to

406
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:23,920
this? The worst superpower ever. The only thing I can think of is bitching parlor

407
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:32,680
trick. There are two bad guys we must blind at the same time. I mean we all have that

408
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,240
moment where we're at a bar we've had a few drinks we're trying to show off say

409
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,640
hey look at how far back I can be from the urinal and still make how many

410
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,000
urinals you got. Now we can add a whole other element to it where you can add a

411
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,120
trick shot. Somebody hand me a mirror. God you could win some bar bets though you

412
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,880
know I bet I can you know. I bet you only have one urethra. Rock! Pay up sucker.

413
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:05,600
Check it. Hi my name is Philip Daniels I'm the most in-demand not in-demand

414
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,720
porn star in the world. They call it the funny shot. There it was. What's up dad?

415
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,400
I actually I did write down one of the answers because it was so great it was

416
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,760
by answer one who said you're telling me you never noticed this well two holes

417
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:33,960
equals two times the fun. Does it equal two times the fun? Does it? I think it equals

418
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,720
two times the explanation. I think like four or five times the explanation since your

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
explanation is I have a urethra I think you probably need a little bit more than

420
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,040
that. You look like you have an alien tweener can you please give me a little

421
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,400
bit more. Confirm or deny? Hey can you read me the part about when he noticed?

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,440
Well he's 17 it sounds like it's a pretty recent. Bullshit. He pulled his force

423
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,800
back and he looked right at the tip like I guess he'd never I never look like

424
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:12,320
straight on. I've shit. Wait has anyone in this room ever checked? When was the last

425
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,060
the last head count that you did? Raise your raise. When was the last census you

426
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,760
performed? You man got bifocals? Raise raise your hand if you checked for a

427
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,960
double before. We're going with a spread shot. People at home zero hands. Zero hands for the

428
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,840
record as long as we're keeping track. I don't know if you remember being 14 I

429
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,680
would have noticed to your research. Yeah I probably would have noticed. That's the

430
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,080
first time you really. That's the first time you really. You do some Lewis and Clark like an

431
00:24:48,080 --> 00:25:01,120
expedition. Did you say Lois and Clark? That's exactly what I said. The first time you did some serious Terry Clark Dean Cain action.

432
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,800
Boom! Nailed it. Yeah thank you. I think Terry Hatcher was the reason I first

433
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,720
explored my urethra. Yeah I mean probably. Let's get out of here. Give me another one.

434
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,880
Another one? Another Yahoo? Yeah you know what I mean. Alright this one will take us down a pretty dark path.

435
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:29,000
Cool cool awesome. This one was also sent in by Jacob Locker. It's by Yahoo

436
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Answers user Megan Curtis who asks why are naked babies socially accepted

437
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,640
though other age nudity is not? Really I've seen advertisements of plenty with

438
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,200
naked babies slash toddlers but why not other ages? It seems stupid.

439
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:56,560
What advertises is she looking at? Yeah that's. Sunscreen, baby lotion. That's it

440
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,960
right? I don't even think we can see this. Full on full frontal baby nudity.

441
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,800
Like a lot of baby nudity. I don't think it exists in the world. What?

442
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,180
Let's presuppose that it does. Let's presuppose we're living in some sort of dark alternate

443
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,680
reality where every ad features baby nudity. You want to buy this car? Check out this baby wiener.

444
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,880
Check out this sweet naked baby. What's that in the passenger seat? It's a baby and he's naked what's up?

445
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Hey do you like frozen yogurt? Do you like frozen yogurt with naked babies in it?

446
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,200
We got you. Don't even worry about it. I've been sitting here while you guys

447
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,280
were talking trying to think of something less sexy than a naked baby. Like you

448
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,200
don't look at a naked baby and go yeah unless like you've got a date with Chris Hanson in the near future.

449
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Yeah I'm just letting you dangle what's up. It's like a baby wiener. It's an aggressive technique yeah absolutely.

450
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
I just don't know how far we can go with this naked baby. You got anything else in there?

451
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Fucking bag of tricks? You fucking psycho pervert? Before I call in the po-po you got anything else in there?

452
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,200
This is one we also found it's I didn't write who asked it. Shit. I'm gonna say Mark.

453
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Thanks Mark. It couldn't have been Mark because the question is what are some good dodgeball names for eighth grade girls?

454
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Could we like save the questions most likely to get us arrested in sort of a Lenny Bruce type fashion like hauled off the stage for indecency? Go ahead Griff.

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Me and some of my friends are in a dodgeball tournament for middle school and we need some names. Any ideas?

456
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
For your eighth grade? Is it eighth grade dodgeball team or eighth grade individual?

457
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I think it's person to person. Oh you mean like the hammer? The hammer.

458
00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:00,200
The little hammer. Little hammer. The pony obliterator? Eighth grade girls like...

459
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The pony destroyer? Well no no no no. The glue maker. Please welcome to the ring.

460
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
We'll talk about destroying ponies all night long. The main boner. But that's what you're going with?

461
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,200
The main boner of dodgeball prowess is she can throw a dodgeball so hard a pony would explode.

462
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I'll fucking blow up a pony. I don't care.

463
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm saying we make a portmanteau. First word something that eighth grade girls like.

464
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,200
The second word is like a really intimidating word of like some sort of damage you can inflict with a dodgeball.

465
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Like princess fuck you up. That's what you mean.

466
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I can't get the pony's ass pounding out of my head but I'm holding myself back.

467
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Whoa! Whoa! I know! Out of decency I didn't say it. I mean I said it but I didn't say it.

468
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I guess you're saying how the sausage gets made because this is exactly the kind of shit like naked babies.

469
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Nope. That's gone. Eighth grade. What was it again? I'm not going to say it again.

470
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Likening out the quinticente right out. That's it. The scrap bin.

471
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I think something oddly robotic would be kind of interesting. Like the smashulator.

472
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,200
The smashulator? But you gotta put like... If her name is Smashley it's perfect.

473
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Smashley is really good. Smashley? Uh huh. That is good.

474
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I want to hear Griffin's last question. But first real quick housekeeping.

475
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Happy two year anniversary to Grant and Amanda who for reasons unbeknownst to me.

476
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Hey guys. Happy two year anniversary.

477
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Sweetheart I love you so much. We're going to have a special night tonight.

478
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Hey you know how you always wanted to see three grown men talk about nicknames for eighth grade girl dodgeball players?

479
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Fucking hop in my coupe. We're driving to Chicago.

480
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,200
And also Johnny Wags and Randy Mac drove eight hours from Marquette, Michigan to hey guys.

481
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Which I was impressed with but it's like I drove eight hours so fuck you.

482
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,200
And thanks to Max Fun and Jordan Justigo for having us and letting us open up for them and share this time with you.

483
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Thank you Dan. Thank you Dan. And thank you Dan. And thank you to all of you guys for coming out.

484
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
You've been super cool and we really appreciate you sitting here and listening to us

485
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,200
almost talk about child pornography but not exactly talk about it.

486
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Skirting the danger zone is what we do. Skirting the skirts we like to call it. Skirting the little skirts.

487
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,200
