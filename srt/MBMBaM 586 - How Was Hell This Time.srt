1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

27
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,700
Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Matthews band

36
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,300
Not even a little bit not that level of excitement not any level of excitement

37
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,420
It's like she's introducing the speaker for like an off off off off off Broadway TED talk

38
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,460
It's nothing a different Dave Matthews band. Yeah, it was originally gonna do it and this bad new

39
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,700
She met Dave Matthews band backstage and did not care for

40
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,180
A big jar of relish

41
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,740
This is shortly after they pooped on a boat and so she's like, I don't want to be associated with necessarily

42
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
Okay up next

43
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,180

Yeah, introducing Nelly. Okay, he had been Affleck knows

45
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,220
How important it is that he be fully fully enthused for announcing Nelly

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:13,380
he understands the optics he's going to be very excited like he just walked into the club and

47
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,680
Saw Nelly performing. I think he's going to have the energy of somebody introducing like

48
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,420
The poet laureate like a seriousness like it's time for you all to experience Nelly

49
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,660
Let's take a listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Nelly featuring Jaheem. Oh

50
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Wow

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,740
Ladies and gentlemen, Nelly featuring Jaheem. I went

52
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,060
Completely. I went to this man. It's been Affleck with it. I think Griffin kind of nailed it. Actually like yeah brace yourselves

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,900
It's Nelly featuring Johnny time for the honored guest

54
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Ben

55
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,460
Justin you and take a swing at like a good way to introduce Nelly. Yeah. Yeah, is it Jaheem Nelly?

56
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,140
Yes, featuring Jaheem obviously

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,500
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Nelly featuring Jaheem

58
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,540
Whoa, that was good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good

59
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,460
I mean you you legally have to say ladies and gentlemen, even though folks don't necessarily rock like that anymore

60
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:24,680
Yeah, but I know I understand that. Yeah, I understand the difference but this is it's SNL baby. It's the old time

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,320
The old good time show the old way this one. I'm excited to introduce to you

62
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,300
Because of the combination of these three people Paul Giamatti

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,040
Introducing ludicrous featuring some 41. Oh stoked out of his fucking mind

64
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,000
Stoked out of his gourd if they had an orgy at the end of that our podcast would be the baby

65
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,520
He's gonna be so excited that the energy might come off as aggressive

66
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,740
Like he's he's so angry and happy to be announcing these

67
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,740
This is my this is my okay my prediction for this one and I don't know

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,300
I feel this way but I feel like Giamatti is bringing like corporate gig energy like he had like

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,320
You know, I used to be big into wide but ever since I tried biller-light and seltzer's platinum, right?

70
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,640
You know that kind of deal. Let's take a listen

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,620
Ladies and gentlemen ludicrous featuring some 41. Oh, yeah, man

72
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,540
Ladies and gentlemen ludicrous featuring some 41. That's how you do it. Actually. Yeah, that's like the best tone

73
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Yeah, that's good. I

74
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,060
Suspected a bit of frenzy would slip into his voice, but that was just like let's get this place fucking right like he and he improved

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,480
Their performance by getting the crowd psyched like maybe they weren't psyched to do it. But then it was sort of like

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,260
You know what? We should give him the best show. Yeah

77
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,020
Yeah, mm-hmm. We should try our absolute hardest

78
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,220
And then he went then he goes and stands in front of the stage like a foot away from them and just like nods his

79
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,940
head like vigorously like he's so and he's like conducting a

80
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,140
And they're like, why is he conducting ludicrous featuring some 41? He's like this is this isn't my usual thing

81
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,820
But these guys can really these guys can really whale like

82
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,100
A bruise on this like like this feels like before he went out right?

83
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,580
He was like, I don't know these are these people are and they had him like turn on some headphones and listen

84
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,600
Like this is good. Actually, I could get down to this. I think I get it. Okay

85
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,020
I'm ready up next Bernie Mac

86
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,780
introducing good Charlotte

87
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,500
Huh, I think if this is close to the end of show, this is actually important information. Is this the first

88
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,900
Music act or the second music act. I don't believe any of these are second music

89
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,660
I believe because none of them contain like once again or welcome back or any kind of yeah, that's a good point

90
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,460
That's a good point. Cuz the second one is always always gonna be

91
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,100
everyone

92
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,740
Good Charlotte like that level and they've left it all out on the court by that point. Yeah, um, I'm been like

93
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,900
the

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,940
amusement

95
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,980
Like he's he he believes that there he says there are people who like this music

96
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,420
It's not my favorite music, but I recognize the actually completely agree with that energy

97
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,820
He's not like pumped about it because he knows that you're gonna read that as phony

98
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,560
Yeah, but he's like he's happy for you. He's pleased for you. Yeah, let's take a listen

99
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,880
Gentlemen good shop. Nope. Good shop

100
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,880
He was eating a big meatball sub backstage like hey you have to go introduce good Charlotte and he's like, okay

101
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Okay, and he walked out there and said it's good Charlotte and then walked back and within 10 seconds

102
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,560
He had that sandwich right back in his mouth now. He's next to you. I would actually rather not guess beforehand

103
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,960
Let's just listen and discuss them afterwards

104
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,440
This is Phil Hartman introducing Bush. Wow. Wow

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Bush

106
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,440
It's like it's like he thinks that the band is going to spray a

107
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,600
Neurotoxin into the studio into the studio Justin can also see the video though Justin

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,360
Can you describe the he's looking directly at you like he's a James Bond villain and you're James Bond

109
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,600
And he's like he's just found out that your secret weakness is Bush. Yeah, and he's like, oh you did, you know, well

110
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, it's it's a it's like levels of intensity that I can't quite communicate to you

111
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,000
That do you have the year that Phil Hartman introduced Bush? Oh, no, I don't know the dates

112
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
That was 1996

113
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Okay, is that good?

114
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,120
Is that good or bad or how do you feel about that? Things were not great for Phil Hartman in 1996

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Stuff he was going through a time

116
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,560
up next Nathan Lane

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,160
Introducing Metallica and just play. Oh, yeah, really? Yeah, this happened

118
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,680
Uh-huh, that's what I'm talking about

119
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,800
Thank you for coming to the show Nathan that is how it is done fucking consummate performer everyone take notes

120
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
I ain't notes from Nathan Lyon

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,520
I don't know if Nathan Lane has ever listened to a Metallica song in his life

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
but that is like a

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,280
A dad like introing his kid like I yeah driving you and he just picked up Brady

124
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,440
And he opens the sliding door in the Odyssey and he's like Brady

125
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,840
Are you ready to go to Detroit to see?

126
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,960
Metallica

127
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,780
As long as we're sort of diving into the psyche of the get the hosts of this show

128
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,800
1997 was when this episode came out around the same time that Nate Lane was in a little film called Mouse Hunt

129
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,880
Yeah, he was rolling in the deep piles of Mouse Hunt money

130
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,920
So he was like I too and yeah, he could be he could be introduced at anybody who'd like ladies and gentlemen

131
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,920
Alert us boys like he would still put that stink on it

132
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,160
If we next time we play in New York

133
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:24,280
Could we pull strings to get Nathan Lane to introduce us in that exact in that exactly that would be incredible okay?

134
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,600
I don't think I have a connection there, but I hope so whatever. I just gotta say what a pro

135
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,880
What a pro okay one last one. Oh, no. This is the greatest one. I've ever it's not a dream Brody

136
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,420
Is it no no not allowed to play a dream Brody, but like if you've never seen that one

137
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,740
It sucks, okay here it is Daniel Craig

138
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
introducing the weekend and

139
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,980
Now don't play it yet. How do you think this one goes?

140
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,460
Hmm. I messed up and loaded I could see the video portion of this okay, well then let Griffin guess first

141
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,700
Yeah, I think he is

142
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:08,620
Overjoyed okay, okay, Justin go ahead and play it ladies and gentlemen

143
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,940
the weekend

144
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,620
Now once again Justin could see the video the weekend

145
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,040
It's like he can't believe someone is named the week. Yes my theory and Griffin now

146
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm gonna send it to you cuz you gotta see it my theory is that just before he went out

147
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,780
Somebody told him the name and he believed that he was introducing the actual like concept of

148
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,620
Yes, but he was like the weekend

149
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,320
There's a shrug that goes with it like I and he shakes his head like the weekend

150
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,260
Question mark in it. It would have been a lot more power

151
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,860
This is worth know it's worth noting that this this a lot of the the other ones have been from an account

152
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
That's full of these sorts of things

153
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,220
That like like hosts introducing. This is an account that is called Craig weekend

154
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,900
mm-hmm that has five hundred and seventeen thousand followers and

155
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:12,940
They just tweet this every weekend. Yep, cuz he introduces the weekend. That's fun. It is fun. That's a good game trap

156
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,700
Thanks. I enjoyed that that trip down memory lane. I always loved that juxtaposition of

157
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,720
performer and

158
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,060
host

159
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,060
Do you think there is any thought to?

160
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,060
How that'll go well not at all after a tree and Brody there probably is yeah

161
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:37,160
I probably is a little script, you know you read what's interesting to me is the the tough part of constructing that game

162
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,380
What's trying to find any video where the host seemed?

163
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,420
Enthusiastic and it was Nathan Lane. That's it. Everybody else seems

164
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh to range between like I don't know and like I know it's weird that I'm saying it too

165
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,180
Yes

166
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,620
it was a pretty good bit one time where Harvey Cattell was the host and Madonna was the musical act and

167
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
He said like I was so excited

168
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:10,380
When I got here and our and I just had this realization that wow, I have a much more enthusiastic gay following than I realize

169
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,420
Because Madonna is there it's good. Okay. So this is an advice show obviously

170
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay that like enough said right? So what we do on this show is you send us your questions. I'm gonna set it up

171
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,020
Oh, here's the deal. Hey, okay. Will you send us your questions in BNB am at?

172
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,060
Maximum fun org and we will answer your

173
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,820
Questions if you need advice, we will help you where there will be other skits

174
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,460
It's good to have bits. I would say there'll be skits. Actually, I don't have any there's no bits scheduled for this

175
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
I just did kind of a bit

176
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,980
Okay, I guess get oh did it? Okay, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah

177
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,940
But let's get into it. Let's help people

178
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,100
I want to try to help more people than we have been helping because I feel like that's our real legacy

179
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,780
Well spending spending 11 minutes talking about SNL insurance is a bad way to start

180
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,980
Hey, hey, it's been 17 minutes

181
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,940
I told my boss that I have jury duty on Monday, which I normally have off

182
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,960
I gave the correct date, but the wrong day

183
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,260
It turns out my jury duty is on Tuesday, and I'll subsequently need that day off a

184
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,320
Game that I'm openly a fan of is releasing on Tuesday

185
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,440
I don't want her to suspect that I'm trying to fake jury duty and actually taking off for video games

186
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,060
How do I break it to her that I got the day wrong without seeming suspicious?

187
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,700
That's from misremembered in, Missouri

188
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,820
I think that this might be like a quantum mechanics problem in which by which I mean

189
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,520
The very don't understand that I don't understand it

190
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,580
No, the very fact that you have I don't think your boss would have thought this

191
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,020
But now that you're worried about it, you have caused through observation this thing to change

192
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
right now because now

193
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,300
Whatever energy you're going to bring to like actually I got the I got the day wrong as Tuesday

194
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,540
will have an undercurrent of

195
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,840
I hope they don't think this is about me playing a video game

196
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,500
And they'll be able to smell it on you. Okay, a couple of good options. What's the game first off?

197
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,300
I got a figure. I mean, yeah, I was looking through recent game releases. Is it cod?

198
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,340
I don't know. It might be cod. They might need

199
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,420
This is the new question. I'd be a franchise because why would you be I was about to say

200
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,540
Why would you be a fan of a new game? It hasn't released yet

201
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,700
But people do that all the time. It seems enough to yell at people on the internet about it. Yeah

202
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,280
Let's see. Let's assume it's Call of Duty because I don't like that. I can't be bothered and we all love it

203
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,800
Like we all call a zero problems with love how serious it is and like not fun. Well, it's really cool

204
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,720
So okay, here's my options one

205
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,680
one loudly like start get a video game magazine from the newsstand just be like

206
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Can't believe this

207
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,160
This new Call of Duty is stinks. They said no you shouldn't even get it. Yeah, that's one way

208
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,040
It's to try to decrease but like I wouldn't do that. Here's how I do

209
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Why did you even say why did you even say it?

210
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Hey guys, this next one's a little more treacherous, but then why even introduce such a shitty idea

211
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,520
You could here's that because this next one is treacherous

212
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh and I need to say that you should definitely do the first one before I mention that you should definitely do the second one

213
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,280
Okay

214
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,080
Hire someone to come in and intimidate you. Whoa. Wait, what at your place of business awesome

215
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,160
Hire someone to come in and intimidate you be like, you know

216
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh, I you know, I heard that you I you know, Paul Calcutta is a good guy

217
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,720
And I think you would never run a red light. Don't you think?

218
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,320
Mr. Guy who loves having all his teeth. Oh and then cracks his knuckles like

219
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,680
That's what Paul Calcutta is means to me. We what does Paul Calcutta mean to you?

220
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:11,000
When you think when you hear the name Paul Calcutta, what do you think do you think innocence me too?

221
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah, well that the juror wouldn't know the name. I think right. I've never had jury duty

222
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,820
So he does now you're gonna have to fake it a lot of a lot of it's gonna be staged

223
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah

224
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,360
So they're not gonna have any way of checking up on Paul Calcutta and his case and if the name is Paul Calcutta

225
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,120
Are any of okay wait one step further Justin and then one step further than that then the intimate already infallity territory

226
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,560
Person says so if I was you I just stay home and play you a little video game. You're so excited

227
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,800
No, hear me out. Hear me out. And then question asker goes no as much as I love that video game

228
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,840
I love justice more. I will not be intimidated Paul Calcutta is going down

229
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah, that's awesome

230
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,640
And then your boss dad. Yeah, call Paul Calcutta's dad on the phone and let me tell him to tell it say his goodbyes

231
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,360
Yeah, no, you know what? I'll call him. Hey call me Paul Calcutta's dad's phone number

232
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,200
I just wanted to check to make sure that I had prepaid for that video game so I can pick it up before jury duty

233
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,640
Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Thanks. Yeah, I told his dad what's up

234
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,320
Fuck you. Mr. Calcutta now here

235
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,240
I hear it. Here's another thing. I'll say there is a way that

236
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,420
You know por que no los dos like you if you go to jury duty Tuesday morning, and you're like

237
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
This man's guilty

238
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
Don't even let him open his mouth everybody we can all see it, right?

239
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,080
We know this man's guilty throw the proverbial book in him five years. Yeah, sounds good. Okay

240
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,120
that's a great day everybody good during I gotta get I got a hot get home the downloads almost completed and

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,620
I'm gonna crank crank it out. Oh, no, I got steam link. It's fine guys. I got steam like

242
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,860
Trial started start over trial start over. I got steam link

243
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Anyone else think this guy's got big stabbing energy I do

244
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,320
I do. He's covered in blood. What are you talking about? Oh, you can't see it. Do a guilty now judge

245
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,040
You just say it we can all go home play Call of Duty. Oh fuck. Yeah, is that out today? Yeah, it's out today

246
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,800
It's out today. I hold myself in contempt

247
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:36,560
We haven't started what we haven't started yet. What you can't handle the truth. I'm I'm leaving you can't leave

248
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,920
You can't go someone fingerprint the judge. I

249
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:50,440
Want a suspicious eye he's got big step final touch the evidence. How do I know it's not a hologram?

250
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,320
Really that judge?

251
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Hey

252
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,780
Could it have been the Riddler I said riddle and we all thought it did we

253
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,280
Hey, how do you know I'm not a judge, huh?

254
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
I

255
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,240
We didn't vote on who the judge would be

256
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,680
Can I be the bailiff this time? I'm not sure what he does, but I always like bull on night court

257
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,520
several times during your your interview to see if you're a suitable juror just stand up and

258
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,440
Produce a knife from your pocket and stab it into the table like in 12 angry men. Yeah

259
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm gonna like yeah, that's nothing right now you like oh, sorry

260
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,720
And then you do it like five minutes later like shake out

261
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
You guys got to tell me when it's time for me to stab my little knife into the table

262
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
Oh, I keep trying to introduce evidence

263
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,000
That's a subway coupon with like six punches out of it

264
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,400
Exactly. I think we all know what this means. I only need four more punches till I get a free footlong

265
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Interesting, isn't it? What a coincidence

266
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
How about another question yeah, sure, I

267
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,160
Don't have a dog, but I love dogs. I see them out and about I waved him

268
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,440
I'll only get an uncomfortable wave from their owner

269
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,120
How can I wave to just a dog without getting weird looks from humans?

270
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,800
That's from incidental dog walker stalker in Denver. You cannot

271
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,720
You can't do this thing. Yeah, you got a wink

272
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,760
No, not that the wave is too big right, but you can do like a hey

273
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,220
We're in this together a wink, you know kind of little thing

274
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,480
So I used to do when I worked at PetSmart and I'd see a dog and like I didn't want to talk to the owner

275
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
But I wanted the dog to know that I was glad they were there

276
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,240
Yeah, yeah pound it

277
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
They could go to the pound

278
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,020
The thing about the wave or the wink is the wink is nothing but the problem with the wave is that's a human greeting

279
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
If you want to smell well

280
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,360
You can't smell the butt because the unless you're like really sneaky like and I'm talking

281
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,640
Sam Fisher very ninja sneaky. Okay

282
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,280
Can you smell the dog's butt for far away and have the dog know it?

283
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,520
Just a sign of just like like a wave is kind of like a long-distance high-five when you think about it

284
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,120
So like you kind of sniff like it was a butt and they're like, yeah

285
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,480
That's but the problem with that is that it's very gross. Mmm. This is true

286
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,160
Maybe when you wave in the human ways back say like that wasn't for you

287
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,920
Yeah, that was kind of a power move is to have a dog treat and then you walk up like oh, hey

288
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,600
I just happen to have this dog treat my pocket

289
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,000
Can I give it to your dog at that point? The dog is like hey, if you say no to this

290
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,720
I'll eat you in your sleep. Yeah, and so then you I'm out. I will I am now this person's dog

291
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,400
It is that quick. It is that easy Jeremy

292
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,280
Do you see this could happen like that Jeremy and I'm gone all these years spent together over on the toilet

293
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,800
I forget what begging strips tastes like Jeremy. So just think about that

294
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,880
Remember how you gave me some sort of pill this morning. They would never do that Jeremy. They they would never

295
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
All right asked and answered I feel like

296
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,800
Do I do another question I do have so I do have a phone line that connects me directly to the clouds where the wizard lives

297
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,280
Um, yeah, let's do it. Let's do that before the money zone. Okay a lot of people sent this one in

298
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,320
It's it's on wikiHow and it's just I guess nobody wrote it

299
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It doesn't have anything. Did I write it?

300
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,800
You may have written it. I mean if no one's gonna claim it I'll claim it

301
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,700
This is how to get rid of a nickname and it's awesome. Ooh. Yeah, people get rid of a nickname

302
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Yeah, I hate my nickname and I want a new one. Well good news

303
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,440
This article is gonna tell you exactly that. Um, so we're gonna start with part one challenging the nickname

304
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
there's a picture here of a

305
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,840
person walking and they're wearing cargo shorts and a hip sort of rugby shirt and

306
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,060
They look a lot like Zack Morris

307
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,680
Which is only notable because in the picture there's a gentleman in the foreground who's yelling Zack attack

308
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:15,240
Oh, and the the tip here is don't answer to a nickname you don't like if someone started calling you by a mean nickname or something

309
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
You don't like the first step is to not respond

310
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay, that's cool. If you're Zack Morris and someone yells Zack attack and you don't even acknowledge them

311
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,900
They're gonna probably follow you for a while going Zack took why wouldn't you like the nickname Zack attack?

312
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,520
I kind of rules. Let's not listen. Okay, you're right. You're right shit. Here's the problem though. What?

313
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,860
you're entering into a battle of wills right at that point because if the other person is

314
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,580
Deeply committed to that becoming your nickname. It's not gonna be a one-time thing, right?

315
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:51,100
They're gonna try to like catch you off guard because if you're a Zack and they're like Zack and you start to turn

316
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
And then they go attack and you're like, yeah

317
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,780
This is gonna freak this person's bean though, if they're like

318
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:05,540
It's not good they're gonna go to someone and be like either I'm a ghost or Zack attack is a ghost

319
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,080
Okay, ask friends to stop using a nickname that's an easy one good friends will understand and don't want to hurt your feelings

320
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,000
You could say guys. I know you think it's funny to call me Zack attack, but I really don't like that nickname

321
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Just call me Zachary. Okay

322
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Yeah, that's a good one deal with a bully but that is calling you a nickname if they're calling you if it's a bully

323
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,820
It'll be harder to confront them. Just ignore them and let them see it hasn't got to you, right?

324
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,060
Like it has though doesn't it takes their power away?

325
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,340
No

326
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,580
Not if you do pretend good enough if bullies call you a name to show them you're not intimidated

327
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,240
You're scared by looking in the eyes laughing and just walking away without looking back or you could say something like here we go

328
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,460
Again, this is boring or why are you talking to me? I like that last one a lot actually

329
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,740
But then the next one is I don't know why you keep calling me that but it's boring and I don't care

330
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Me thinks the Zach attack do protest it too much

331
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,100
Yeah, that one might not have the power you're hoping for there of yes is boring

332
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,780
What do you this isn't for you? Wait, hold on Zach attack

333
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,740
Did you think I was calling you Zach attack for your entertainment because it's for my entertainment

334
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,940
Was that not clear how this transaction was playing out? Oh, let me explain Zach attack. I'm a bully. I hate you

335
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,060
Yeah, we are not you to define myself. Yeah, right because I am a very

336
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
small person in my heart and

337
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,380
So I need to feel big by making you feel bad and now that you've engaged with me and said that it makes you feel

338
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,260
bored

339
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,540
That's actually a negative thing. So I'm I'm fine with that actually

340
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,420
Yeah, any any sort of thing that I can do to sort of steal your shine? Yeah, right amazing. I'm a hater

341
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:49,100
I what don't you get bud my hater and now I'm drinking hater aid. I love it

342
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,380
I live for it kick you in the butt. Yeah, that's right it and I don't care if you like that either Zach

343
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,300
Oh, sorry. Wait, yeah, that felt good. Wait, Zach

344
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,540
Zach kicking me in the butt. So boring. Why don't you leave?

345
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,340
Why are you in the butt? Why don't you go away from me stinker?

346
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,620
Introduce yourself at the start just introduce yourself casually by saying hey everyone. I'm Jill

347
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,300
I don't know that I've introduced myself in a while not because I'm big shit, but also that I don't

348
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
meet people meet people

349
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
when I do I

350
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
like require a

351
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Hype person not even a hype person but somebody who can literally just a hype person to the extent that

352
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:38,780
Bernie Mac is a hype person for Charlotte. Oh, I was a good hype person for you. Yeah, so just something to say

353
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,980
Everybody in this room Griffin didn't make the expectation setter. Yeah. Yes, exactly

354
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,820
That's interesting because I was going to suggest a Herald which I think I've suggested quite often on this show a few times

355
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,300
But it would be nice to just have somebody like as like an like a human auto correct

356
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,740
That when someone's like hey Bobby and they just lean and go it's Bob

357
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,740
It's Bob

358
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,880
maybe you could get a cameo from Paul Giamatti just saying hey everyone, here's Griffin and then you can like

359
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,140
You know hack into the speaker system of any party you're at just play that as you walk in. That's good

360
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,560
Oh get a cameo from Nathan Lane. That's like he's only going by

361
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,980
Griffin and then like you can play that anytime someone's like what's up Griffey and you're like, hold on

362
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,440
Let me hold on. Wait a second. I have a very important cameo from Nathan Lane. I have to show you

363
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,280
And

364
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,480
Also last thing remember that nicknames don't last forever and then there's a picture of a woman saying little Zaki

365
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,760
to a little boy and then as a grown-up she's like

366
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,200
Zachary it's all she says is Zachary and then there's a period and she looks pretty serious

367
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,800
So like but Zachary is smiling. So it looks like his his older mother is saying Zachary

368
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,100
I can't talk to you something along those lines Zachary. I'm happy to present

369
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,460
Zachary here is Bush. Can we just say that saying

370
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,440
Nicknames don't last forever is a complete lie because there are many like

371
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,020
Like people throughout history. It's like Stonewall Jackson. I've got no idea what that dude's first name is. I know I know

372
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:25,580
Yeah, yeah, you could there's so me. I bet there's there's war heroes out there that you walk around and

373
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,740
They were like in World War one or whatever and it's like tell me the story

374
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,460
Grandpa about your friend. Oh, you mean big boner Joe like cuz that's what they called him out there

375
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
That's rough out in the trenches

376
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,860
It could be worse. I guess little little boner Bobby

377
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,500
How are none of these suggestions in this like try to come up with a different better nickname? Well

378
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,860
I think they just who if your name is Zachary

379
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
That's all I would want to be called

380
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Fuck. Yeah

381
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,980
Yeah, especially the last name is Levi and you can be Zachary Levi

382
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,700
Star of Shazam. Why would you be Zachary Levi star of Shazam? If your name was Zachary Snackery. Oh

383
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,940
Oh

384
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,060
Here comes Zack attack and I would be like fucking do you guys know my last name?

385
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,300
Just call me Zack snack. You've nothing else like

386
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,540
But don't do that. Please. Call me by my full

387
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:30,020
Christian holy shit, if your name is Zachary out there, by the way, I just gave you a pretty good nickname of Snackery

388
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:39,300
That one works at pretty much every age so and they could call you Zachary. So like is that attack that bad?

389
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,860
I

390
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Yeah, it's pretty proud. It's pretty rough

391
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,900
Any more graph of Zachary nicknames, yeah, let me think

392
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,700
Shackler Shackery. Well, that's pretty good

393
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,980
John Zachary what if you like got went with a cameo idea, right?

394
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,980
But it was like a live-action cameo and you paid like let's say like John Stamos, right to like walk by you

395
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,300
And and say like, oh, hey, man, you've got a really cool vibe

396
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,740
What's your name? And you say Zachary and John Stamos goes Zachary. What an amazing name

397
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,500
Why would anyone call you anything of Evan Zachary?

398
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,340
It's fake conversations going on so long so long

399
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,620
I'm gonna know listen get I can get us out. We're going to the money zone. Come on

400
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:37,380
I'm gonna stay here with John Stamos

401
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,820
Brooklinen. Oh, no, I was gonna do it. Sorry tough. But Brooklinen makes great sheets and I love them

402
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,980
no, see you don't even know what you're talking about Brooklinen actually makes great sheets and

403
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Everybody loves them, but it's beyond

404
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,180
Sheets, they got something for everybody on your gift list

405
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,420
You want a weighted blanket and a nice cozy robe?

406
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,660
They did a fun thing where they you they could let you pick somebody to send a gift to that's fun

407
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,180
I said, I know I sent a t-shirt to my wife

408
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,700
Sydney and she was very weirded out because why did I do this for you?

409
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:19,020
I said to me I said open the box and you'll see and is a very comfortable black t-shirt and she put it on right there

410
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,660
In the kitchen, you know what? She said best t-shirt I ever wore Wow this black t-shirt ever wore

411
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,140
I think she said it's so nice that the romance is still alive after all these years

412
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,260
They're alive because you know

413
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:34,620
Sometimes it's it's easy to remember to buy plain black t-shirts for your loved ones early on in the relationship

414
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,180
But it's so easy to let that kind of flame die out and it's so good to hear that you are still

delivering the heat after all and it's a great place to find a gift and

I open I just wanted to say I open a Stitch Fix box earlier this week, and it was a fiver

423
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,740
I kept all five. Oh, yeah, whoa

424
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,380
Yeah, I usually keep a majority on but you know a fiver you got to talk about

425
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,980
This is the time for me when Stitch Fix really shines

426
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,580
And that is my friends sweater weather

427
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,460
Because I don't know how they do it

428
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,420
But every sweater Stitch Fix has ever sent me is a keeper

429
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,420
It's that chunky sweater like they know me so well at this point

430
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,460
They send me a sweater one time that just putting it on and I can't explain it

431
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Makes me feel like one of the assassins from Assassin's Creed. It's a hooded sweater. Does it have knives in it?

432
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,460
I don't know Griffin, but there's something about it that makes me want to skulk

433
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,140
Yeah, and listen, that's because my size my style. It's all my own

434
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,660
It's about what suits me and what suits the moment and that's the thing man

435
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,700
You go to a store and you're like none of these clothes are for me. This is not my store

436
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,180
What am I doing here? This is not my beautiful life

459
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,740
Obstacles that our world and our brains throw in front of us depression anxiety

460
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,020
Traumatic stress all those mental health challenges that are way more common and more treatable than you might think

461
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,340
The first time I went to therapy I was so ashamed and I was like can't believe I gotta go in there

462
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,580
Like I thought I could be a man and comfy book art was never in therapy

463
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,860
And my dad said yeah, but he smoked a carton of cigarettes a day

464
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,300
Give your mind a break. Give yourself a break and join me for depression mode with John Moe

472
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,660
Welcome on squad. It's podcast within podcast profiling the latest and greatest in we've

473
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,320
Here's the first thing I say to you people. Yes, everyone tweeted me about Arby's

474
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Making vodka listen folks

475
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:24,420
This is much squad. It's not the thirsty zone. Okay. No, we're for it for

476
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,500
sawbones

477
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,260
Yes, it's the thirsty zone. Okay

478
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:36,260
Arby's drops limited edition curly fry and crinkle five vodka is vodka based on their fries. Okay?

479
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,140
This is much squad. We have standards. Okay. Yeah

480
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,700
I'm gonna try to get some of it. Okay, I'm dry. I'm trying to get some of you

481
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,780
I'm gonna try to get some of it. Okay. All right, I need you to do by the way

482
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Like a tasting video of that

483
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,500
With Sydney because you'll lie and say it's good to seem cool and Sydney will be on. Yeah

484
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,580
But here's the thing, right? Like this is what I want to try to get across

485
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:09,740
I'm munch squad. I try to make a difference and there's if there's an exception I'll mention it, but I don't like these companies

486
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Just doing things

487
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,660
To get the headlines. I'm on school. Yeah, they're just wanting the attention from munch squad

488
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,900
Arby's doesn't think one good thing for Arby's would be vodka. You know what I mean?

489
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,500
Like they don't think they're doing the right thing. So when you say thirsty zone, it's not just about drinks, right?

490
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,380
They're acting thirsty, right? They're acting thirsty. Yeah. No, no. No, I should have been more clear about that for the beginning

491
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
I see that now

492
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:42,900
What do you I see it oh what I thought from five miles away my incredible rich

493
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,100
Wait, I heard you don't have supervision

494
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,460
Well in my bad form I have

495
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:58,100
Okay, wait a minute if you know wait if you killed Justin to do this bit it was completely silent and outrageously

496
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
fast I

497
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,660
Think it's more of us. I used

498
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,500
incredibly

499
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,900
Fast-acting poison. I use Kuro

500
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,340
Incredible fast-acting poison the modern beast

501
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
The modern beast

502
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,700
I'm getting confused by the Count Donut lore because I can't tell if he dies in you

503
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:27,500
Like a Jekyll and Hyde thing or if you're he dies his body dies temporarily by which I mean his soul

504
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:35,660
Is sent to hell. Oh, wait, why all his body? Yeah spoiler and then control his body to

505
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,280
Bring you the latest donut news. Okay, and then I

506
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,220
Evacuate him back into the night or in this case the 1115

507
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,100
But I really like listen Count Donut. I enjoy your presence

508
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,860
But I did not realize it came with the cause of my older brother being temporarily in hell. Yeah, hell sucks

509
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,900
Dude, it's but when he comes back, he appreciates things so much

510
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,220
Yeah, do you know this one scene where they pull the gun on the man and then they say he will love breakfast tomorrow

511
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,980
And it's supposed to be a thing that like you learn like oh nice, dude. Yes in the educational documentary fight

512
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Anyway, I'm here to talk about

513
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,740
Donuts not Chuck Palahniuk. What?

514
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,860
Krispy Kreme has announced it Halloween is over and on Justin's birthday

515
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,380
November a very special day to Justin

516
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,660
Krispy Kreme announced their thanksgiving

517
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,460
Donut collection

518
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,360
Krispy Kreme is encouraging Americans to share

519
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
gobbles of gratitude

520
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,360
With no doughnuts this Thanksgiving season as

521
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,960
Boy, this is a kind of freshly. Sorry one second. I need to get to my compulsion

522
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,860
as 80% of respondents in the national survey say

523
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,820
Celebrating Thanksgiving is more important than in previous year. Oh boy. What?

524
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,020
Why?

525
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:29,260
And nearly half are planning to attend more Thanksgiving celebrations than they did before the COVID-19

526
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,820
Pandemic. Yes good

527
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,500
Hooray says Krispy Kreme people are doing a worse job than they did before

528
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
They're getting even more nasty

529
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:47,820
Than they did before COVID was a thing just pack them in like sardines and cranberry sauce

530
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,820
They're nuts off

531
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,340
Fantastic, I love this. I love suffering you do

532
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,500
Thanksgiving is more important than previous years

533
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,900
Here's a quote from Dave Skinner the chief marketing officer for Krispy Kreme listen

534
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,500
We missed out on so much last year

535
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,940
Including Thanksgiving celebrations

536
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,580
This Thanksgiving people have a desire

537
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:26,900
And need to be together more often and more so than any other Thanksgiving

538
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,940
Nastier and rubbing more

539
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,180
A lot more dry humping this year. Sneeze right on me Nami

540
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:43,140
So we're creating a way to share your gratitude with others in the most delicious way possible

541
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,360
Because nothing says thank you for having me to Thanksgiving like a box of doughnuts

542
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,720
You bought the day before Thanksgiving because there's no way they're open

543
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,420
According to a new survey even during this cooking and baking filled holiday

544
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,820
56% of consumers plan to spend less

545
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,660
traditional time in the kitchen

546
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,100
In order to spend overdue time with miss family and friends

547
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,900
That is a wild sentiment

548
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,380
More than that. I wish Justin was here to talk about this because that's a truly wild

549
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,340
I don't know how I'm supposed to gain literally

550
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,260
I feel like I understand everything less than I did before I read that

551
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,260
No insight has been important. I love that the insight Krispy Kreme took away though

552
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,980
It's like okay spend less time in the kitchen. So you can spend more time with your family

553
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,980
So they want to buy doughnuts from Krispy Kreme to include in Thanksgiving

554
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,380
The idea that lunchtime comes around and everybody sits at the table and they're like, all right guys time to eat

555
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,100
And then everybody just kind of looks at one another like who?

556
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,420
Who cooked who cooked food for us? Oh, no

557
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,780
No, none of us spend any time in the kitchen to enjoy your presence. Yeah

558
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,100
so Krispy Kreme

559
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,700
According to this new survey. I love the brand feels it needs science to justify the fact they made the fucking cranberry doughnuts

560
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:16,300
I've never heard you cuss before. It was wise for us to do this our top top scientists

561
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:23,100
We didn't want to but we follow the science we took this survey so we could prove to you that we don't need to make

562
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,860
Thanksgiving doughnuts and you all were like nah, give me those fucking nasty doughnuts

563
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,660
This is the problem Krispy Kreme started giving out doughnuts to vaccinated people

564
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,540
But once you start following science, you cannot stop right?

565
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,820
No one warns you that you're giving away everything at the altar of science. So here's the doughnuts, right?

566
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
become pie

567
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
What does they say about this one?

568
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,800
pecan pie lovers will rejoice over this iconic

569
00:45:52,540 --> 00:46:00,300
Original glazed doughnut dipped in delicious butter tart filling then sprinkled with candied pecans and pie crust crumbles

570
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,940
I'm all right, so the audience for that one is people who like

571
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:12,740
To finally have something to be happy over because there hasn't been a lot of new innovation for pecan pie lovers

572
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,220
Over the last like forever like they got the pumpkin pie and they're like, this is great

573
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,540
I can't wait to see what comes next and then no one really ever did anything with it and finally something for them

574
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,540
You know what I mean, right?

575
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,900
Krispy Kreme guests can also express gratitude to loved ones

576
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:36,460
friends and others by packaging their Thanksgiving collection doughnuts in Krispy Kreme's custom gratitude box

577
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
while supplies last

578
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:46,580
Which features a space to share gobbles of gratitude with someone special via a note on top

579
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,740
So I can't you can't see this of course

580
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,060
But what it is is a box from Krispy Kreme that has a white part at the top

581
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,260
This is grateful for you because and in a blank space

582
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:06,660
So Krispy Kreme says congratulations. We've done this for you. We've made it easier than ever to share your gratitude

583
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,260
All right, son, get the sharpie and go to town. I just want to know I I know I've never said it before

584
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:18,440
I just have never had the words but now that I have this box I can finally tell you well just read it

585
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,820
okay, dad, it says

586
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,500
I'm grateful for you because I

587
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,220
Love you. Yeah, that's right. But I did eat half the doughnuts on my way over here out of nervousness

588
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,940
So I am sorry about that. So I was so nervous to admit. So anyway, that's the donut news

589
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,940
goodbye

590
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,060
Goodbye count on it

591
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:46,380
Wait, wait, hold on now we have to cut out the 12 minutes of screaming that Justin does whenever he gets brought back from hell

592
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,380
Yeah

593
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500

Okay. All right. I don't like this bit. No, you can't come up with a good joke above it. Yeah

Yeah, look at him and you know, he's bad Justin canonical a canonical yes

607
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,340
Why does he know all these scary stories?

608
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,460
You don't tell stories like that to good people you tell them to evil people that are going to real
