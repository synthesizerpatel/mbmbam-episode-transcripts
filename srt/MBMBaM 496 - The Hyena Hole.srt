1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am, let me check my notes,

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,440
your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby, Griffin.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,240
Why didn't you feed me? Oh, wow. Hey, Griffin, you just actually gave me shutters

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,120
because I've got two kids now, and Justin's got two kids,

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,720
and the idea of introducing a new baby to my family again?

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,480
Well, here I am. It's heartbreaking. Oh, boy.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
Griffin has introduced, this is actually a perfect segue, Griffin,

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
what you just said about the fact that you're a baby.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,960
What's that segue? Help me understand with my baby brain. Milk, please.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,120
Here's what I wanted to say. It's 20-funny, feel your life with laughter and love,

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,560
and I feel like to do that, we're going to need to make changes in how we conduct

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
ourselves in our daily lives. How are you taking care of yourself?

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,160
No more baby play? No, it's not that. For this episode,

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,520
I was thinking about sometimes in this podcast, and I hate to admit it,

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
but sometimes we say things we don't mean to try to make people laugh.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,840
That's shameful to admit, but I'm going to go ahead. Griffin just said that he was a baby,

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,160
but that's not true. I was a lie. Certifiable lie.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
That's not true, what Griffin just said. He's not a baby. For this episode,

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
I'd like to say that I only want to say stuff that we really mean,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
and we could really stand behind it as true. Can I zero in real quick?

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,200
Can we speak in metaphor and simile? Yeah, that's a literary thing.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
I just don't want you to say things you don't mean.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,080
But if I said, I'm a total baby, that's different than, I am a baby, goo goo gaga.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
I think Justin's on some The Giver shit, where it's like, you can't say,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,320
oh man, I'm really starving right now, because it's false,

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,520
and now we're going to turn you into goo, or whatever.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, just truth speak in this episode. Can I speak my truth for a moment?

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Yeah, please Travis. Stretch your legs.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,080
This is not just a joke I'm making to be funny on the show.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,200
You fucking don't have to clarify that. It is so obviously the premise.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
If someone offered to pay me a hundred thousand dollars,

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,640
I could not name who is playing in the big game this year.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Okay, this is interesting. I am in the same boat, Travis.

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,520
I was informed last night by my wife of who the teams are in it.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,960
I believe this one's going to be the four nines,

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
and I think it's also going to be the chefs in this one.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Great Googly Moogly. You remember that?

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
No, but if you remember Great Googly Moogly from-

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Justin, I want to play along with this bit,

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,880
but if I can't reference the Great Googly Moogly Snickers commercial,

46
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,400
what the fuck are we even doing here?

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
Okay, but I love that, but I do want to say, you said the chefs,

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
and I need to dial in and to see if you think the name

49
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
of the professional football outfit is the chefs,

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
or if you have violated our contract of speaking the truth.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
I also said the four nines, and I feel like-

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
That could be, that's debatable. Actually, it is a four and a nine.

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,880
Yeah, no, I got a buddy who's a diehard Chiefs fan.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,680
He's over the moon excited, so I'm trying to glom on to that

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
to give even the littlest bit of a shit about that Super Bowl,

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,440
but I will say, and this is my honesty, you know this,

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,000
the shine doesn't come off that holiday apple

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,840
as soon as my body stopped being able to process buffalo flavorings.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes. As soon as my tummy was like,

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,520
what's the plan for tonight, Chief? It's Sunday, big game.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,840
I'll be like, oh, I was going to go over to my friend's house.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,240
Ah, cool, cool, cool. Here's a list of rules.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
No ranches, no buffalos, no cheeses.

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,200
You may have a plate of ancient grains.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
You may have one bowl of quinoa.

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
I knew that it was over when during my Super Bowl planning,

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
I uttered the phrase, oh yeah, nice,

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,640
I think they have a cauliflower crust.

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,680
That is it, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done.

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
So anyway, I am looking forward to seeing the boys out there

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
throw an old hog ball around, trying to get,

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
it's so hard to be earnest for one whole 60 minute period.

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
You said you're looking forward to it,

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
but then earlier you said you didn't give a shit.

75
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
So which is it, Griffin?

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,040
I mean, I want to see the boys throw the hog ball.

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,640
I want to see that, I want to see that hog sack get chucked.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm gonna say that I like just an event where a lot of people

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,920
seem to be, you know, culture is so fractured now.

80
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,000
I like an event where everybody's just kind of

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
on the same page and watching the same thing

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
they don't really care about very much,

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
but at least we're all getting together and doing it.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
Who's doing that halftime show?

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
You know, I think, I think I don't know

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
and I haven't cared until now.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
We're being so honest.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,040
It's Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, holy hell.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,880
That one's gonna be good.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Pepsi's gonna do us right on that one.

91
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,080
I wonder if they'll use drones.

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,040
I bet they'll use drones.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
They've used drones the last couple of years.

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah, I mean, they'll probably both open their mouths

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,200
letting out a swarm of nano drones,

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,400
which will go into the audience

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,760
and give everybody a set of new AirPod Pros.

98
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Now, Griffin, do you think, do you honestly think

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
that's a real scenario that could happen?

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm just, do you think that that's a scenario

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
that could happen?

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
I think it, hey, it can happen.

103
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040
So that's gonna be a new thing that I'm working,

104
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,760
it could happen.

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,560
That's our obligatory football discussion.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
Far more earnest this year than past years.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
That's about where we're at with the Super Bowl.

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
I don't know if the audience enjoyed it, but I did.

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
I like not having to put up a front and pretend like I care.

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
Now that said, I'll probably tune in.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll probably check out maybe like a middle 14, 15 minutes.

112
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
The best bit, oh, that's the heart of it.

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah, I'll watch the seven minutes

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
before the halftime show.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
You don't wanna watch the last two quarters

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,400
when all the boys are so tired already.

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
So tired, and they're sending in, let's be honest,

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
second and third string players.

119
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Yeah, here comes fucking Dan Marino.

120
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,760
Do you think there is a player on the team

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,280
that knows they're the worst and is going into the game

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,920
hoping, just like wondering like, I might get,

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,600
there is like maybe three to four people on the planet

124
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
that are going to this game thinking like,

125
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
I might get to play in the Super Bowl, and I might not.

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,200
I actually don't know if I'll be participating

127
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
in this year's Super Bowl.

128
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
Here's what I'll say, J-Man.

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,800
If there are anything like me, having been the worst player

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
on a lot of teams in my life, they're probably thinking,

131
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
God, I hope I don't have to play in the Super Bowl.

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
Fuck, I hope my dad's not here.

133
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah, I'm fine sitting on the bench.

134
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
I have the best seat in the house, are you kidding me?

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Travis was sort of an anti-Rudy.

136
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Yes, please don't send me out there.

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
His whole team laid their jerseys down

138
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
on the coach's desk saying, seriously though,

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
have you seen Travis's body?

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
Holy shit, if you put him out there to wrestle.

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,680
Travis asked us to come in here and tell you.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
He said he was worried about, quote, being annihilated.

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
So here's my jersey, please don't put him in, coach.

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
Travis is just wearing jeans and a T-shirt.

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
He's watching the game on his phone on the bench.

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
Please don't put Travis in.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
He's holding a big sign that says, I got ringworm.

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,080
Yes, I do.

149
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
So I don't even think he's allowed to be on the court.

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't think Travis showed up.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
I think he just kind of Skyped into the game.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
Please don't put iPad Travis on the field.

153
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,640
Let's do our show.

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,760
This is our show.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Well, let's do the real stuff.

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,040
Get to the middle, mate.

157
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,600
I want to get to the middle 14, as Travis has called it.

158
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes.

159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,000
Where do I look when I'm being serenaded by my boyfriend?

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
For the exit.

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
The only options I could think of are

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,960
to stare at him dead in the eyes and smile awkwardly,

163
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,800
look at my phone, or pretend to be tired and fall asleep.

164
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,840
Each option sucks, but I really like his music.

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
That's from Creepily Staring in Washington State.

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Wow, that's actually a difficult question to answer.

167
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,960
It's a real one.

168
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm really glad you clarified that you do enjoy

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
the being serenaded experience, because otherwise-

170
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

171
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
They enjoy the music.

172
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,200
Ooh.

173
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
The serenading experience probably sucks shit.

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
I read your mind.

175
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
You're talking about a masked singer kind of scenario,

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
but maybe masked listener.

177
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Now we're talking.

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
There's that.

179
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Now we're cooking.

180
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah, imagine masked singer,

181
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,520
but Chrissy Teigen is the one in the mask.

182
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
Maybe she's paying attention.

183
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
Maybe she's not.

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,200
We don't know.

185
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
The nice thing about this is once you establish

186
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
your masked listener character,

187
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
you could maybe sub in your nephew or dog

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
if you get bored of the music.

189
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
Let me suggest this response.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
You kind of push your fingertips together,

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,520
a crease, make a triangle with your hands,

192
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
and you close your eyes and you kind of tell them,

193
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
yes, go on, go on.

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,640
And you nod along with your eyes closed.

195
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
You are just soaking it in.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
I gotta close my, I'm using too many of my other senses.

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm gonna plug up my dang nose and cover my eyes

198
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
so that my ears are like, hell yeah, baby.

199
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,160
We got more energy.

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,720
The ship has transferred more energy over to us, the ears.

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,220
Yes.

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
Maybe you can look at your boyfriend and say,

203
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
wow, this music is really cool,

204
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,520
and you know what that's got me itching for.

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,080
And then you put on some shades.

206
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Oh, okay.

207
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,960
So far, are all of these earnest answers?

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,000
No.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
Yeah, I mean, I think all of them will be good.

210
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
Maybe not the masked singer one,

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,840
but I would do the kind of steeple fingers.

212
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
Steeple fingers closing your eyes is very good.

213
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,120
I think sabotaging it, but in a loving way,

214
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
is also really good.

215
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Where just like as soon as he starts playing,

216
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
as soon as he starts playing Wonderwall,

217
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
you can just kinda like,

218
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
Yeah, man, yeah, that's great.

219
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
I love this.

220
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,080
If you do that enough,

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
then there's no way they're gonna be able to keep tempo.

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
This rocks, dude.

223
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
Yeah, you could do what my daughter does

224
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
and just say, no, no singing.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, that's not it, obviously.

226
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,800
My problem with the closing your eyes

227
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
and making steeple fingers

228
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
is I feel like if you do that exact thing,

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
when your boyfriend finishes playing,

230
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
he's gonna be very disappointed

231
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,840
if you don't open your eyes and are just like,

232
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
that's it, I've heard enough.

233
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah.

234
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
This is the sound I've been looking for.

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Sign this contract.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
Welcome to Superstar Records.

237
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240
I've been Randy Jackson the whole time

238
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
and I've been deep, deep undercover.

239
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Now, can you start clapping loudly

240
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
and tell your boyfriend to match your tempo?

241
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,240
Oh, that's great.

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
Maybe throw a cymbal at them.

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,280
Hit it on the one and the three.

244
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,840
Just really goof him up.

245
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
You're dragging.

246
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
You could focus really intently on his fingers,

247
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,040
like, how is he doing this?

248
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
Just lean in closer and closer.

249
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Do it, Santana, I'm loving this.

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Yes.

251
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,360
Okay, I'm trying to put myself in the position.

252
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
The closest I think I've ever been

253
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
is like when my friends were in bands

254
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,240
or were writing music or something,

255
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
mostly in college,

256
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,960
and would play me some of their stuff

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,080
and just like on their computer

258
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
and I had to be there.

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
And I think we can all agree,

260
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,320
the eyes are a non-starter.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
You cannot look in the eyes

262
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,960
because that's the window to the soul

263
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
and sometimes you're not ready to see

264
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
what is swirling around on there.

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,200
So most of the time,

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
I would just kind of look down at the ground

267
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,520
and then like after a few bars,

268
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,080
I just kind of get a smile on my face.

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Like, yeah.

270
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
And you just sort of nod my head like, yeah.

271
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,280
This is the 100% earnest answer.

272
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm just like, I can't look at you,

273
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
but you can tell from my bump in my head

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,960
and smiling that this is a great little

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
slice of Americana.

276
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Literally, Griffin, as you were,

277
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,400
even before you said like bopping the head,

278
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
I want you to know,

279
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
I started instinctively bopping my head

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,680
just picturing listening to music

281
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,640
because, and you're right,

282
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
because if I'm looking you in the eyes

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
while you play your music

284
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,920
and I'm bobbing my head,

285
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
it's going to be impossible for me

286
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
not to start to say things like,

287
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,280
oh yeah, oh, uh-huh, that's it.

288
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,160
You're doing it.

289
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
Like, there is no way

290
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
I could just make eye contact and bob my head

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,760
because here's the thing,

292
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
if you start that way,

293
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,680
at some point you have to look away

294
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
and no matter when that happens,

295
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,360
it's gonna be bad, right?

296
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,880
Because then it's like, and no more.

297
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,160
Playing guitar is a shameful thing

298
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
and it should be done in private.

299
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
I don't feel that way.

300
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
I actually think that there are many contexts

301
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
in which a little guitar music is nice

302
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
and obviously there's a lot of people

303
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
that make a living from guitar music,

304
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
so I don't actually think it's a shameful thing.

305
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,960
Carlos Santana, mentioned him earlier.

306
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
Joe Satriani.

307
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,520
Okay, two.

308
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,440
Bela Fleck plays banjo,

309
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,280
which is just around guitar.

310
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,400
Okay, to name three guitarists,

311
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,720
one of them had to play banjo for you.

312
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay, interesting.

313
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
He's a rural jazz banjoist.

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Robach.

315
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,840
Thank you, Graham.

316
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

317
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
who I'm gonna call Bela Fleck who asks,

318
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
how can I ask my friends to throw a pie

319
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
in my face on my b-day?

320
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
Oh, so my b-day, it's coming up

321
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,840
and I'm gonna go all out for drinks and food.

322
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Funny thing is, I've always wanted to be pied in the face.

323
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll be drunk, so it will be even more funny.

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,280
But I'm going to be wearing party slash going out clothes

325
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,800
and will def have makeup on.

326
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,280
So I wanna get messy to make it more funny,

327
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,680
but at the same time, not completely ruin my outfit.

328
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
I'll probably be wearing a leather skirt

329
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,720
and bodysuit IDK,

330
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
but I really wanna make this the b-day

331
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,960
I get pied in the face.

332
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
How do I go about doing this?

333
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
Like asking also what kind of pie

334
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
would be best to be thrown in my face?

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
I would like something that is comical,

336
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
like makes a splat sound when the pie hits me in the face.

337
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,360
Thanks.

338
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,880
Obbs.

340
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,400
Obbs, you want a splat sound.

341
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,920
You don't want like a pecan pie.

342
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
That would just hurt.

343
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,800
Fuck, that would be rough.

344
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,040
It's so good.

345
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
That's a dense pie experience.

346
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,160
Heads up.

347
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,840
Clang, boing, boing, boing, boing.

348
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,000
It just fell to the ground, unaffected.

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,760
It made a perfect mold of my face.

350
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,160
Like one of those pin toys.

351
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
That's no good.

352
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,920
You want like a, in fact, just a pie tin,

353
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,920
an aluminum soft like flexible pie tin full of whipped cream.

354
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,960
It's really all you need.

355
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,560
Yeah, I feel like it's funnier though

356
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,520
if it's got cherries and some crust.

357
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,840
Well, cherries are going to stain maybe like a custard.

358
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,320
Hey, this is maybe a perversion,

359
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
but now I'm just thinking about what it would feel like

360
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,440
to have your face sort of slowly pressed into a pumpkin pie.

361
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
Pumpkin pie is different.

362
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
Pumpkin pie is solid.

363
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,760
That would make us, holy, you want to talk about the splat sound.

364
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,840
Pumpkin pie is going to get you there, baby.

365
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
What about a cheesecake?

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
A cheesecake's going to make that same yucky splat.

367
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
Oh, shit.

368
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
Here's the problem.

369
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,520
I don't think, I think just to run it back to the very beginning of the premise,

370
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,680
I think that in the asking, you ruin it, right?

371
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Because then you're going to be like spending the whole evening,

372
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
like your anticipation,

373
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,600
this is one of those things where sometimes anticipation

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
makes you excited for something,

375
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
but knowing a pie is coming because you asked them to do it

376
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,520
removes all spontaneity of it, right?

377
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,840
Like it seems to me,

378
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,160
oh, I think it just makes it more delectable

379
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,440
because then you know that creepy surprise could come at any moment.

380
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
I think it's got to be reverse psychology though.

381
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
I think for weeks ahead of your birthday,

382
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
you have to say things like,

383
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I just, whatever we do guys,

384
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
I just don't want to get pied in the face.

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Am I right?

386
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,840
Huh?

387
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,960
That would be too silly for me to even deal with.

388
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,760
Turn on a fucking, turn on an episode of What Would You Do

389
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
with Mark Summers, not with John Quinones,

390
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,960
and just like every time anybody gets slimed or splatted or pied,

391
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,160
I'd just be like, oh, the indignity.

392
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
Oh, can you even believe it?

393
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,600
Did you see that?

394
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,040
He got pied in the face.

395
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,240
He could have gotten killed.

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
I would like to ask a request

397
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
on behalf of all of the restaurant and bar owners

398
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
that you may be attending on your birthday.

399
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
I would kindly request that you not do that

400
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
sort of in my business.

401
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
I would very much like to not have to sort of deal

402
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
with the repercussions of your pie mess.

403
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,040
Okay, here's what you do.

404
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
And Justin, I've taken your concerns

405
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,960
into consideration here.

406
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
That's a first.

407
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,880
And, well, okay, hey, we don't need to air that

408
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
in front of everybody, but,

409
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,000
and you're not going to mess up your outfit this way.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Oh.

411
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
But this is going to have to be

412
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
something executed by your friends.

413
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,880
So stop listening for a second.

414
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
Friends, listen, you're going to put the pie

415
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,800
on the table in front of them.

416
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,240
You're going to say, I worked so hard on this pie

417
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,760
and I put a little something extra special

418
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
in the whipped cream, smell it,

419
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
and see if you can guess what it is.

420
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
And then you're going to push their face into it.

421
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
No pie in face, face in pie.

422
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,520
It's going to control the whole splatter.

423
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
I tell you what, man, just start,

424
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,840
you could, if you want to do it Travis's way,

425
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
you could just slowly scoop spoonfuls of pie filling

426
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
and cream directly onto the areas of the face.

427
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
Almost like you're doing some sort of rejuvenative mask.

428
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,560
Because if we're going to,

429
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,680
if we're going to just sort of break the laws

430
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,120
as Travis has suggested,

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,720
you know that this is this person's yucky splat perversion

432
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
and that is not going to get the fucking job done, Travis.

433
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
They need the terror of it.

434
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
They need the horny fear of this pie.

435
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,040
What if you're so excited for this,

436
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,200
you think this is going to be the funniest shit in the world

437
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
and then your friends pie you

438
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
and suddenly you realize like,

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I fucking hate this.

440
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,480
Have you two boys ever been pie in the face?

441
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,840
Yes, I've been pie in the face.

442
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
I got pie in the face at church once,

443
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
not during even youth group,

444
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
during a Sunday sermon about gambling.

445
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
I don't think I have.

446
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
I got splatted right in the face

447
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
and folks let me tell you at home,

448
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,320
it's funny,

449
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,920
but you are being hit in the face with an object.

450
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes.

451
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,160
And that feels bad.

452
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
You have to come from the side, by the way.

453
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
It can't be direct at nose

454
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,840
because there is a plate in there.

455
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
Feels no good.

456
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
You gotta aim for the cheek.

457
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,360
Aim for the cheeks.

458
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
So maybe that's the secret,

459
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,560
but I definitely think that this is a nasty thing

460
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,440
that this person wants for sex reasons and sex purposes.

461
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
What's with all the judgment?

462
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm not judging, I'm stating a fact.

463
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
You actively said nasty.

464
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,880
No, they like that it's nasty, Justin.

465
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay.

466
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,800
Like when I call them a sick freak,

467
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,880
that's part of it for them.

468
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
Capital S, capital F.

469
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,760
They love that.

470
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,920
In the grand fullness of time

471
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
with everyone who's ever lived on the planet,

472
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,200
do you think that at least once

473
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
someone has died from getting pie in the face?

474
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah, absolutely, 100%.

475
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,880
I think probably half a dozen clowns have died for this reason.

476
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
Here's what I imagine happened.

477
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
A first-timer pies their friend in the face,

478
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,560
they leave it on there for two minutes

479
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,240
and they just keep their hand up there.

480
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
All of a sudden, their friend just collapses

481
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
in a bottle on the floor.

482
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,560
It's not funny anymore.

483
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,240
I could see that.

484
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,520
I could also see maybe getting, like I said,

485
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,080
direct on nose, direct nose hit,

486
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,680
but you come up and at an angle

487
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,240
like we're all afraid of when you get hit in the nose,

488
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,800
right in the brain.

489
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,360
That's it.

490
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
So I think let's just put out a PSA, folks.

491
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,920
Pie the butt, pie the crotch.

492
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
One of those two is going to be even funnier

493
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,920
and there's not going to be a lot of bad brain-based damage.

494
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm just going to say belly button pie, it's not bad.

495
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,320
That's funny.

496
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,960
That's funny.

497
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
A pie hitting you anywhere is funny.

498
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,080
A pie anywhere but being held in your hands

499
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
to be served at a table,

500
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
that's not where a pie should be.

501
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Comedy is all about the unexpected.

502
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,560
It's upside down on top of the head.

503
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,880
Don't do it right side up on top of the head.

504
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,000
You'd have to balance it.

505
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
Here comes another question.

506
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,800
I made a fuck ton of chili,

507
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
which I plan to freeze in batches

508
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
and consume over a long period of time.

509
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
However, I just lost my job.

510
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
So for the moment, all I have to eat is chili.

511
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
How can I spice up my chili eating

512
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
to make it a bit more diverse?

513
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
This is from Too Much Chili in Chile,

514
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,040
pronounced Chi-li-i, New York.

515
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,000
It's Chi-la.

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,040
Too Much Chili in Chi-li-i, New York.

517
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,600
It's so weird that you live there, by the way.

518
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,080
What a coincidence.

519
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Considering.

520
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
You have a lot of chili.

521
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
You don't want to eat the chili, but you must.

522
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
Yeah, because-

523
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,320
They did want to eat the chili, broadly speaking.

524
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
Yes, they wanted to eventually eat the chili.

525
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,160
Right, but in this economy?

526
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,160
I don't know what that means,

527
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,720
but I assume it means that you gotta eat the chili.

528
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
But how can you spice up?

529
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,800
All right, let's get all the bad Cincinnati-based

530
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
bullshit out of the way.

531
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,720
Spaghetti.

532
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,920
Gone.

533
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,920
Hot dogs.

534
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,960
Tiny hot dogs.

535
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,160
Little, little dogs.

536
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,520
Little Franks, if I may.

537
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,840
Can I make a point, though?

538
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,200
I do want to be clear.

539
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
If they had money for hot dogs,

540
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,320
this wouldn't be an issue.

541
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
This is not the question that is before us.

542
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,560
They are not buying other food.

543
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
They need to spice up just chili.

544
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Like, you can't say, like, put it on top of a burger.

545
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,560
That's not the option here.

546
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,520
I think we need to get kind of like a gastro pub.

547
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,000
Maybe take this molecular science kind of thing.

548
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Maybe we need to freeze dry some chili.

549
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,320
Okay, I was gonna say, I don't know.

550
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,800
I mean, okay, you freeze dry the chili trap,

551
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,200
but you don't have money to go out and buy liquid nitrogen.

552
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
So I guess you just put it in the freezer for a long time.

553
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Yes, these are my chili popsicle.

554
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,160
You grate that.

555
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
Ooh, chili popsicles is very, very good.

556
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,760
You can reduce it and keep reducing it until it's just gone.

557
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
And that can be a fun science experiment for kids.

558
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,160
Maybe like a chili mist that you just puff.

559
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,880
Chili volcano, spicy prank slime.

560
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
Maybe a chili IV, puff the chili.

561
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
Use its abrasive properties to cleanse your face skin.

562
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,600
Throw some chili and some ice cubes into a blender.

563
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
Make yourself a smoothie.

564
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
That only works if you've got a blender.

565
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
If you don't, stuff the chili and ice cubes in a big Ziploc bag

566
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
and just start stomping, baby.

567
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,000
Maybe rather than we spice up the chili itself,

568
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
we rather make the consumption experience more interesting.

569
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,560
Take the chili with you to different locations.

570
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,400
Enjoy your chili at the movies.

571
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Enjoy your chili while feeding the ducks.

572
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,240
Would you put you in a boat?

573
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,800
Hey, I want to give you guys an idea

574
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,440
and just tell me if it's anything, okay?

575
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
Because I'm not really sure right now.

576
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,840
Is it earnest?

577
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
But yeah, it is earnest.

578
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
This is something you could do.

579
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,600
What if you added a little bit of salt to the chili, okay?

580
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,920
And then you tasted it and then you added more salt

581
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,760
and you just tasted it again.

582
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
And then you kept repeating that process

583
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
until it was so salty that you couldn't,

584
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,760
you really just couldn't, you know what I mean?

585
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,880
And then the next day you do the exact same thing again

586
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
and with presumably more salt.

587
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
You build up a tolerance.

588
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
So yeah, so what I'm thinking is

589
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,920
at the end of this experience,

590
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
it will have been difficult for you

591
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
but you'll be able to brag like,

592
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,080
no matter how salty that chili is,

593
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,760
I'll be able to enjoy it.

594
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,880
I can take my chili saltier than anybody you know.

595
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,920
I can take the saltiest chili down, no problem.

596
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,680
Hey Terry, how are you?

597
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, it's been a rough month.

598
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,160
But the good news is no matter how salty a chili,

599
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm never going to send a chili back for being too salty.

600
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,240
A lot of people would try spice,

601
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
make it spicier and spicier and build up a,

602
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,880
I think that that reeks of a sort of false machismo.

603
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah.

604
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,960
I don't think you should do that.

605
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
You want the most brackish chili.

606
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
Give me the dead sea chili.

607
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah, Justin, you realize the other side of this

608
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,480
is that all chili is going to taste

609
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
absolutely fucking flavorless.

610
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,280
Yes, it'll be like eating chili

611
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,600
in a commercial for antidepressants.

612
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,680
Like you'll take a bite and it's like mm.

613
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,600
You'll look down and it'll be gray.

614
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Everything's all gray.

615
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,800
Yeah, but like you will have a fun personality

616
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,720
quirk of like, hey, I went to go eat chili with Derek

617
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
and this is going to sound insane

618
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,440
when he unscrewed the top of the salt shaker

619
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
and just dumped it right in.

620
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,040
Oh, you mean, you mean never pissed Derek?

621
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,720
You're talking about shriveled Derek?

622
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
The weirdest part was all the deer in his yard

623
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,320
looking to lick him.

624
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
That was maybe the strangest part

625
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
of going to Derek's house.

626
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
This is so, I'm really enjoying this

627
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,800
and that last one was kind of funny,

628
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,440
but I do think it's about the time in the recording

629
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
where we should stop for a moment

630
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
to read the messages from our sponsors.

631
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:12,960
All right, Travis, now do advertisements

632
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
without saying anything you don't mean.

633
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I love me undies.

634
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
All of my underpants are me undies.

635
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
All of my favorite.

636
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,760
Mariam, why don't you marry him?

637
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
There's no law on the books just yet

638
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,160
that says I can marry them, but we'll see.

639
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,200
That's what you say.

640
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,040
2020, now that was not earnest.

641
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,680
I don't think in 2020, there will be a law on the books

642
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,280
that will let me marry my underpants.

643
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,400
Who can say, with this government?

644
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,680
Fair.

645
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,720
This is earnest that if there was

646
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,560
a mandatory law that said I had to commit

647
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,640
to wearing one kind of underpants

648
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,680
for the rest of my life, I would choose me undies.

649
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
And here's the thing.

650
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,960
Not only do I love me undies, they love you.

651
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
And to show how much they love you,

652
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,480
me undies has not one, but three new Valentine's Day prints.

653
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,960
So you can match with your faves this year,

654
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,320
whether you're matching, well, okay.

655
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
Now me undies, you put even your dog.

656
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
Is that earnest, me undies?

657
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
Yeah, man, they got dog clothes.

658
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,160
Do you have dog underpants?

659
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,600
Yeah, dog buddy bands.

660
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,840
I want to match my pet.

661
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Hey, it was earnest.

662
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,520
And I earnestly apologize for questioning you.

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,320

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,600
Hey, can I say something earnest?

671
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,100
Yes.

672
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
Hey, you've earned.

673
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,280
There it is.

674
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Very good.

675
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,400
Yes.

676
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,360
Finally, you earned it.

677
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
Don't fucking do that to me.

678
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,040
Don't do that to me.

679
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
We've been doing this 500 episodes.

680
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
Don't do that to me.

681
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,720
I liked it.

682
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,440
I enjoyed it.

683
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,560
I liked it.

684
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,080
Stitch Fix is our next one.

685
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
Stitch Fix is great.

686
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,320
They send you a box that's going to be

687
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,400
just chock a block full of clothes

688
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,400
and those clothes are going to be picked out

689
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,560
by expert stylists at Stitch Fix

690
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,240

691
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,400
what you like, what fits,

692
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,280
what's going to feel nice on you.

693
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,640
What's your preference?

694
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,800
Is it a season coming up?

695
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
They'll keep that in mind.

696
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,880
They'll ship you a box of clothes, shoes and accessories

697
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
and then you're going to try it on

698
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520

712
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,000
You wept as we crafted the tragic tale of Jar Jar,

713
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
a Star Wars story.

714
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,280
Do you mean like he forgives Darth Vader?

715
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Mesa still love you, Annie.

716
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,320
You gasped out loud at the shocking twists

717
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,600
of Face Off 2.

718
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,560
Face is wild.

719
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,320
He takes his kid's face.

720
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,360
What?

721
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,560
We're writing an entire screenplay week by week

722
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,440
on StoryBreaks season two, Heaven Heist.

723
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
Hey folks, Freddie Wong here with some exciting news

724
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,440
about StoryBreak, the writers room podcast

725
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,120
where three Hollywood professionals have one hour

726
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,560
to spend cinematic gold.

727
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,480
We're shaking up our format by turning Heaven Heist,

728
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
one of our favorite ideas we've ever come up with

729
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
on the show into a full screenplay.

730
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,120
Heaven Heist is an action comedy

731
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,320
about a crew of misfit gangsters

732
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
robbing the celestial bank of heaven.

733
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
Think of Coco Meets Point Break.

734
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,600
Join us as we write this crazy movie scene by scene

735
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,680
and get an inside look at the screenwriting process

736
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,760
on our podcast StoryBreak every Thursday

737
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,840
on MaximumFive.org.

738
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,000
I want a munch.

739
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Squad.

740
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,720
I want a munch.

741
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,280
Squad.

742
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Pizza Hut will reward first set of twins born after Super Bowl.

743
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,600
What?

744
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,640
How?

745
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
How?

746
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,940
Why?

747
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,800
Pizza Hut's going for two

748
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,520
and hoping a couple lucky parents can convert

749
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
on Super Bowl Sunday.

750
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,120
They mean give birth to human life.

751
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,720
The pizza restaurant returns to Super Bowl live

752
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,520
for its second year as the official pizza sponsor

753
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
of the NFL on February 2nd.

754
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
This year, the family that welcomes the first set of twins

755
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
born after kickoff is going to get amazing prizes.

756
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Oh, boy.

757
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,320
The press release goes on to say,

758
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,440
a family has always been part of Pizza Hut's DNA,

759
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,160
which is why the restaurant will honor the MVPs

760
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,120
making their own special deliveries this Sunday.

761
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,520
The winning family will get a trip for two

762
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,480
to next year's Super Bowl LV.

763
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
Two years of free pizza

764
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,680
and in honor of its ongoing commitment to literacy

765
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,840
through its iconic Book It program

766
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,960
will also reward $22,000 to kick off the twins' education funds

767
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
along with a custom curated starter library

768
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
and handpicked by the Book It team.

769
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,320
So Pizza Hut's book experts will pick books

770
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
to send to your children.

771
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,640
Now, one thing that I find engaging about this

772
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,000
is that the people they have chosen to fly somewhere

773
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,320
to a football game for two,

774
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
they know for a motherfucking fact

775
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,920
have two 12-month-olds almost to the day.

776
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,400
Right.

777
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,240
Extremely close to that.

778
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
So there is, I would say,

779
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,560
a thin chance of the parents cashing this in.

780
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,080
I think it's kind of a foolproof, foolproof system

781
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,880
they've worked in.

782
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,320
The two years of pizza, they'll be gaga about.

783
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,520
No question about it.

784
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,040
The 22 large.

785
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,240
The 22 large.

786
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
That's all right.

787
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,160
That's damn decent.

788
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,660
Sure.

789
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,880
These people are not going to the Super Bowl.

790
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,240
They're not gonna do it.

791
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,080
They're just not gonna do it.

792
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,560
Who better to help Pizza Hut

793
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,480
welcome the first set of twins

794
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
on the biggest day in football

795
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
than Super Bowl lead champs

796
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,280
and identical twins Devin and Jason McCordy?

797
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
We know parents don't get an off season.

798
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,200
What?

799
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,320
You heard me.

800
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,880
Sorry, bud.

801
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,600
Shit, man.

802
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
As twins and parents ourselves,

803
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,080
we're pumped to help honor-

804
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,080
Wait, what's that?

805
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,120
We can't win?

806
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,620
Shit.

807
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,240
Dang.

808
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,320
We're pumped to help honor one lucky family

809
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
welcoming twins on Super Bowl Sunday.

810
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,400
We have awesome family memories

811
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,600
of Pizza Hut growing up.

812
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,960
Treasured Pizza Hut memories.

813
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Our dad's Pizza Hut would take us fishing.

814
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,040
We've always been passionate about food,

815
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,160
family, and football.

816
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,280
Those last two make sense,

817
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
but what does the first one have to do with Pizza Hut?

818
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,200
It feels great to be a part of Super Bowl campaign

819
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,720
that spotlights all three.

820
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
So here's what you gotta do.

821
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,680
Parents with twins born during the game

822
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,640
simply need to post a photo to Twitter

823
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,400
of their new baby,

824
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,360
including exact types of birth

825
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,480
with a hashtag P-H-T win to win

826
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,640
and hashtag promotion and tag at Pizza Hut

827
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,720
to be included for consideration.

828
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
There will be people who will spend

829
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,720
among the first moments of their child's life

830
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,480
at least a few seconds.

831
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
They will steal to stare at their phones to tweet.

832
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Hurry, doc, doc, give me that baby.

833
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,320
Give me that baby.

834
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
Don't wash it off.

835
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
There's no time.

836
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,960
You gotta be first.

837
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,200
Honey, there will be people who will have

838
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,040
some permutation of this fucking conversation.

839
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,480
Honey, please keep the babies in

840
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
for just another moment

841
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,160
so I can tweet a picture of them

842
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,080
to Pizza Hut after the game kicks off.

843
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,280
Please, I beg of you.

844
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
I gotta wait until I see that beautiful hog sack

845
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
flying through the sky

846
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
to indicate that football has begun

847
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,080
and then, oh, babe, you're screaming so loud.

848
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,600
I know, it's not good.

849
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,240
Once that big, beautiful ball arcs through the air,

850
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,080
then the baby can crowd

851
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,000
and our life together can begin with this child.

852
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
Now, if you'll excuse me,

853
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,920
I'm going to tweet a picture of our infant to Pizza Hut.

854
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,680
Don't forget the hashtags, honey, both of them.

855
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
Fuck, fuck, that's dire.

856
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
The least they could have done,

857
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
the least Pizza Hut could have done

858
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,320
is told us about this contest last April.

859
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes, thank you.

860
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,360
So that willing couples can mark it to the day

861
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,320
early May, pork down,

862
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
drink whatever kind of tea you need to drink

863
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,800
in order to make two of them happen

864
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
and try to aim your shot then.

865
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,240
You know what I mean?

866
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
Because there's a lot of people who are like,

867
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,280
oh, shit, my baby's due in like December.

868
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,680
Ah, shit, my baby's not due until April.

869
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,320
That sucks.

870
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
Tell me last April so I can take a fucking,

871
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
so I can line up my shot

872
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,840
and throw that dart and see what happens.

873
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,280
Can I tell you boys something?

874
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
We're missing a huge thing here,

875
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,040
which is, I don't know about you guys,

876
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,080
but Baby Dot was a scheduled C-section.

877
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,760
There is 1000% some parents out there going,

878
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,920
would you happen to have any slots on Sunday?

879
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
It's so grisly.

880
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,280
Oh, I can't, I'm watching the big game.

881
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,520
Shit, all the doctors are watching the big game.

882
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,640
Yeah, but if you try to schedule it during the big game,

883
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,920
the doctor would probably tell you,

884
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,560
no, thank you, I'll be enjoying the big game.

885
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,440
You can't schedule it.

886
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,360
You have to trick me into coming

887
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,960
with a series of riddles

888
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,960
that lead me to the hospital and then and only then.

889
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,280
What's that, you're throwing a party at this address

890
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
and I just need to show up?

891
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, wait a minute.

892
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,160
Wait a second, there's an OR here.

893
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
Not expecting twins?

894
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,080
No worries, there's still a chance to be a winner.

895
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,520
See if you can find another baby

896
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,120
that looks just like your baby.

897
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,840
I would argue that by not expecting twins,

898
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,240
I am feeling pretty much like a winner already.

899
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,440
Thank you very much, Pizza Hut.

900
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,520
I don't need you to prop me up, but no worries.

901
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
I will still have worries, Pizza Hut, thank you.

902
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,880
Keep an eye on the Pizza Hut Twitter handle

903
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
throughout the game on Super Bowl Sunday

904
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
for a chance to win great prizes.

905
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,080
We'll be giving away two babies.

906
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,360
Yeah, keep an eye on, did you mean to say

907
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,960
keep an eye on this fucking hashtag

908
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
to see the adults that tweet a picture

909
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,480
of their twins to Pizza Hut?

910
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,760
Because I am gonna be doing that for sure.

911
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,240
Hey, just real quick, just checking in, Pizza Hut.

912
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,040
What if it's triplets, but I only take pictures

913
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,000
with two of the babies?

914
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
It's not called going for three,

915
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
it's not their field goal challenge.

916
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,340
Damn it.

917
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,480
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

918
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,080
Yeah, I like that.

919
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,840
Here's one sent in by Emma Cant.

920
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,640
Thank you, Emma, for also emailing us

921
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,200
and letting us know about the-

922
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,680
Wait.

923
00:38:59,680 --> 00:38:59,920
What?

924
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,680
I think it's-

925
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,720
No, it's not.

926
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,200
No, I received an email saying,

927
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
from Emma, thank you, Emma.

928
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,440
Sorry, I goofed it up so bad so many times.

929
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,240
It's from Yahoo Answers user Trickster, who asks,

930
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
I was at a zoo today and I have my backpack open.

931
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,080
When I got home, I realized a small animal

932
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,440
had flown inside.

933
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
Should I return it to the zoo?

934
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,940
What?

935
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,920
The subtext.

936
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,800
The text of this question is that they have stolen

937
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,640
an animal, a small bird.

938
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,880
Or flown might mean, they may say like flown

939
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
like when I say, ooh, that beautiful hog sack

940
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,400
is flying through the sky after being thrown

941
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,680
by, you know, Brett, Brett, whatever.

942
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,360
Can we just for a moment agree

943
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,800
that whoever wrote this question,

944
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,040
not specifying the animal is perhaps-

945
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,600
So wild.

946
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,800
It's one of the weirdest parts about it.

947
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,880
Like, if it's like, it's a squirrel or a sparrow,

948
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,440
like, no, just let it go outside.

949
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,920
But if you're like, it's a, I don't know,

950
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,000
baby hippo or some shit, yeah.

951
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,400
I think we've talked about this before.

952
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Correct me if I'm wrong.

953
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,600
But when a bird, like a pigeon, flies into a zoo,

954
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,160
a city zoo, and it's just like chilling,

955
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,480
it's not part of zoo at that point, right?

956
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,960
It has not become a temporary sort of floating exhibit

957
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,840
for zoo.

958
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,280
That has to be true.

959
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,760
I mean, sometimes though, I do see kind of more like,

960
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
there's a lot of zoos that I feel like

961
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,880
just let their peacocks just wander around

962
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,120
because they think they're not gonna hurt anybody,

963
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,560
but they're so big.

964
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
And when they spread their tails out,

965
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,280
I feel like they're very scary

966
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,560
and are capable of anything.

967
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
There's gotta be a couple peacocks

968
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,600
that just wandered in off the street.

969
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,720
Are those zoo now?

970
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,100
Huh.

971
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
Now you say wandered in off the street,

972
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,320
which would leave me to wonder,

973
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,440
where is this zoo?

974
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,880
Oh, New York City, baby.

975
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,360
Home of peacocks.

976
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,960
The big apple.

977
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,200
The natural peacock home.

978
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
So I stole a penguin from the zoo

979
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,480
because I read a cool autobiography

980
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,280
about a penguin haver that I really liked.

981
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,480
And so I thought I would get one for myself.

982
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,600
And how do I get it back into the zoo though?

983
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,440
Because you know they check your bags.

984
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,760
Here's what you're gonna have to do.

986
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,280
You're gonna have to go back to the zoo and say,

987
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,520
I would like to donate my animal to this zoo.

988
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
And then they'll look at it and be like,

989
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,640
that's little Jeremy.

990
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,160
We know, we know this bird.

991
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,920
We know, we're a zoo.

992
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
We know which one is Jeremy.

993
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,720
You have put a mustache on Jeremy.

994
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
Yeah, we know him.

995
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,640
We know him.

996
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,360
Oh, that would be kind of fun actually to Jeremy

997
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,800
to put like kind of sunglasses and fun shoes

998
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,120
and a tank top on him and just walk him into the park

999
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,200
and say he's your nephew.

1000
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,320
He's my nephew Jeremy.

1001
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,360
I want to show him the zoo.

1002
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,480
And then as soon as you're through the threshold,

1003
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,640
you 180 walk out and then it's just a small penguin boy

1004
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,080
waddling around the park.

1005
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
Somebody's gonna pick him up no question

1006
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,960
and get him back where he belongs.

1007
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,120
At the end of the day, he is still a penguin.

1008
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,960
Before you go into zoo,

1009
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
that's your nephew whose feet makes loud sounds

1010
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,440
when he walks.

1011
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes.

1012
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
Although you did already pay the ticket price

1013
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,920
to get you and your nephew in.

1014
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,640
You could at least-

1015
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,760
Just enjoy your day.

1016
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,240
Just show them around.

1017
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
Just enjoy your day first.

1018
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
Show them around as the concession stands

1019
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,720
if they have any fish and go look at the tigers

1020
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,640
and be like, you'll never fuck with one of those.

1021
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,920
Jeremy, don't even trip on it.

1022
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,720
Well, that's a great point

1023
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,480
because that's the thing when you think about birds.

1024
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,040
Birds, when you're a pigeon, right?

1025
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
You might not be part of zoo,

1026
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
but you get to consume all of zoo.

1027
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,800
But when you're a penguin,

1028
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
can you imagine if a penguin,

1029
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,400
you just took it over and said,

1030
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
hey, look at that animal.

1031
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,080
And it was like, whoa, hey, elephants exist.

1032
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,720
What the fuck?

1033
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,440
How does it feel?

1034
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,760
I think that if I'm at zoo

1035
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,680
and I ask one of the animals

1036
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,320
if it wants to come home with me

1037
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,000
and it says it indicates that it does.

1038
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,600
Okay.

1039
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,640
I don't think it's right

1040
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
that the zoo would be able to stop it.

1041
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,920
I think that's fair.

1042
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,200
I think if I go to the penguin exhibit

1043
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,320
at the St. Louis Zoo

1044
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,800
and I walk up and those penguins are so close

1045
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
and I see a cute little rock hopper.

1046
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,680
He comes right up to me.

1047
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
He's like, and I'm like, oh shit.

1048
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,200
Oh shit.

1049
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,400
Are you feeling this?

1050
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,760
And the rock hopper is like,

1051
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
I'll be like, hey little bud,

1052
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,400
my house is not really set up for it,

1053
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,840
but I can get like a little freezer

1054
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,600
or I can like figure something out for you

1055
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,800
and keep you in fish.

1056
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,560
But I like, I'm feeling this

1057
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,320
and I know it's not make-believe.

1058
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,400
This is like the beginning of before sunset.

1059
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
Like you seem pretty chill.

1060
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,040
Do you want to come home with me?

1061
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,600
I should be able to take him home

1062
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,960
or else it's not zoo, is it?

1063
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,680
It's jail.

1064
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,800
That's fair.

1065
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,120
I think zoos should be more like a library

1066
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,320
than a zoo.

1067
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,720
Yeah, I'll return it.

1068
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,680
I will check this hyena out

1069
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,600
once I have tired of it

1070
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,720
and learned about it

1071
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,480
and grown with it, if I may.

1072
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,240
I will return it in the slot

1073
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,440
that you have provided outside for hyenas.

1074
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Yeah, I'll put it right in the hyena hole.

1075
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,240
Now to be fair,

1076
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,680
you only use the hyena hole

1077
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
if it's after hours.

1078
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
And also if it's a hyena,

1079
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
don't put little Jeremy in the hyena hole.

1080
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,040
No, no, no, no.

1081
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,760
Oh my God, no.

1082
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,840
He's got his own little penguin boy hole.

1083
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,960
That's where he goes.

1084
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,720
Put him in where the penguin boys go.

1085
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,200
Yikes.

1086
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,360
I'm just saying,

1087
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,480
if nothing else,

1088
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,720
I should be allowed to check animals out of the zoo

1089
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,720
for Instagram.

1090
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,600
Okay.

1091
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,160
Interesting.

1092
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,040
This is actually,

1093
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,560
you should be allowed to.

1094
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
It's actually kind of a denial of your rights

1095
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,240
as an American

1096
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,560
that you can't check an animal.

1097
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,320
Hey, if the zoo, okay.

1098
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,440
If the zoo came to you and said,

1099
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
you have to check out an animal for a week.

1100
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,160
Again, Ernest,

1101
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,440
what animal would you check out for a week?

1102
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,720
You will be solely responsible for its care.

1103
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
I would take a fennec fox.

1104
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,920
You didn't even fucking hesitate

1105
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,520
to bring a carnivore into your home with an infant.

1106
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,520
It is smaller than buttercup.

1107
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,600
Buttercup is like,

1108
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,960
yeah, buttercup eats meat.

1109
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,080
You know what I mean?

1110
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm not worried about her eating my baby.

1111
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,280
Well, I am, but only a little.

1112
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,760
So has the fennec fox been,

1113
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,680
let me think,

1114
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,640
bred genetically over millennia to not eat your baby?

1115
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

1116
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,960
I didn't know you were a fan of eugenics.

1117
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,200
Whoa, Kate.

1118
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,560
No, absolutely not.

1119
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,240
No, incorrect.

1120
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,120
It's GMO.

1121
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,520
It's different.

1122
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
With foxes, it's more GMO.

1123
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,720
I'm reading here it eats mainly insects,

1124
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,320
small mammals, and birds.

1125
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,400
And shits.

1126
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,160
Well, you don't fucking know, do you?

1127
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
Okay, what's your answer then, smart-o?

1128
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,520
What?

1129
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,680
Obviously a fish.

1130
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,720
You put it in water and fuck off for a week.

1131
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,280
Who cares?

1132
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,720
Yeah, but what's the benefit?

1133
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,240
You're saying-

1134
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,880
What's your benefit?

1135
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
You're saying that this is like a punishment

1136
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
that the zoo is enforcing on you.

1137
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,760
I barely want my cats.

1138
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,920
Like, and I'm supposed to watch a fox?

1139
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,040
No way.

1140
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,680
Griffin, what animal would you-

1141
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,800
You guys are thinking of the least worst animal.

1142
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,840
And I like the least impact.

1143
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,560
That is what I'm doing.

1144
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,480
I'm trying to enrich my life.

1145
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
You know I'm taking home a Dunstan.

1146
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,240
Oh, boy.

1147
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,840
Griffin, that's gonna go so bad.

1148
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,720
Griffin, you have no idea the help that will be elation your house.

1149
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,680
Because I've got a Faye Dunaway that I need to perplex and bamboozle.

1150
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Oh, Griffin McElroy.

1151
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,200
I've got a fucking Jason Alexander that I need to pull one on.

1152
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,240
There is no amount of setup you could do in your home to be ready for a Dunstan.

1153
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,320
Who will repair you for Dunstan?

1154
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,680
That's why the sequel is called Nothing Will Repair You For Dunstan.

1155
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
Nothing can stop this madness.

1156
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,240
Nothing Will Repair You For Dunstan is the sequel to Dunstan Checks In,

1157
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,800
which is for 90% of our audience.

1158
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,760
A movie about...

1159
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,120
I don't even want to say it.

1160
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,760
Can we have...

1161
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,960
Okay, can we have a word that's like both monkey and ape?

1162
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,720
So you don't have to fuck with it every time.

1163
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,600
We'll just say orangutan.

1164
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,960
He is an orangutan.

1165
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,000
So we'll just say that's every monkey and ape.

1166
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,880
That's gorillas, that's monkeys, we're good.

1167
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,120
But if I had a Dunstan, I could do funny pranks to Jason Alexander and Paul Reubens.

1168
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,760
And also, he could help me with stuff.

1169
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,560
Like your homework?

1170
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,720
No, Trav.

1171
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,080
I'm being earnest.

1172
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,920
He could help me with the cooking.

1173
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,040
He could help me clean up.

1174
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:53,920
Okay.

1175
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,400
He could help me hurt Faye Dunaway.

1176
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,680
If I wanted to...

1177
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,400
I'm not saying I want to hurt Faye Dunaway, but if I did,

1178
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,400
I think that this is the monkey slash ape slash whatever for the job.

1179
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,040
Oh, you know what?

1180
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,920
I changed my answer.

1181
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,480
You know what animal I would take home from the zoo?

1182
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,680
Man.

1183
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,360
So you'd take a human person home.

1184
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,680
I know my house is already set up for them.

1185
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,000
You know that this is not the zoo's policy.

1186
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,840
You're not going to fucking...

1187
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,600
They're not Rumpelstiltskin.

1188
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,320
You're not going to trick them with this bargain, okay?

1189
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,840
You have to take a real animal, not man.

1190
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,280
The most beautiful, perfect animal.

1191
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,720
You know what I'm going to do?

1192
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,760
I'm going to wait until one of you two picks an animal,

1193
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,760
and then I'm going to pick an animal that is effective against it.

1194
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,280
Oh, like a Pokemon.

1195
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,780
Okay.

1196
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,580
Yeah, say Justin gets a hippopotamus.

1197
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,080
Uh-huh.

1198
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,820
I'm going to...

1199
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,500
No, the problem is, Justin, if you get a fish,

1200
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,660
most animals are pretty effective against fish.

1201
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,300
Yeah, you just have them.

1202
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,340
You just have the fish.

1203
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,700
I want to make a quick announcement.

1204
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,260
Normally when we talk about animals, people who know more about animals

1205
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,220
than us decide to saddle up and come on over

1206
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,380
and tell us the things we said that are wrong.

1207
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,140
Please save your time.

1208
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,780
Unless...

1209
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,900
We know all the...

1210
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,340
Unless you're Jeff Corwin.

1211
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,180
Because I've been meaning to hang out with that fool.

1212
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,100
If Jeff, if you want to get at us with your animal info,

1213
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,620
or just Travis, I am not familiar with your stuff.

1214
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,820
Oh, Jeff Corwin had a great show on Disney when I was growing up.

1215
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,820
It taught me a lot about how to pick up snakes

1216
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,860
with a big hooked red low cane.

1217
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,060
I learned how to pick up snakes from mystery like a proper gentleman.

1218
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,420
He taught me about negging snakes.

1219
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,940
That's our show.

1220
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,860
Thank you so much for listening to the podcast.

1221
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,180
My brother, my brother and me is an advice show

1222
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,060
and we're so happy that you spent some of your time with us.

1223
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,580

00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,620
and you would like to come see us perform,

1225
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,100

by heading on over to bit.ly forward slash 20 funny

1227
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,300
and you can get tickets to our shows on February 19th and 20th.

1228
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,340

1229
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,580
The 20th will be The Adventure Zone.

1230
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,260
So please come see those shows

1231
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,340
if you have not already purchased tickets.

1232
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,020
If you can get on over there, we would sure appreciate it.

1233
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,820
Oh, thank you.

1234
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,460
And we'll just go ahead and say, I can't give any specifics,
