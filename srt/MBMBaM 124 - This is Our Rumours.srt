1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:45,120
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era,

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,720
where we're about to find out what's in the box. What's in the box? I got a box, and now

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm opening it, and I want to know what's inside. Griffin, what's in the box? I'm using my car keys,

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,680
and it's not good. Let's take guesses what's in the box. Is it an exciting product from extreme

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,400
restraints? A dead fish. Nope, because I'm afraid of my penis. I'm afraid of what it might do one day.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,480
Your penis is a dead fish? Man, you're taking people on a sonic journey with these box cut

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,320
noises. This is like that thing at Cosi where you put the headphones on and sat in the dark

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,600
room and listen to the people walk through the haunted house. This is like Radio Lab,

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,720
but instead of talking about emotional science, I'm opening up. Oh, it's a high definition webcam.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,440
That's not interesting. One of the bad things about using Amazon Prime for all your purchasing

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,840
is that every once in a while you'll excitedly open a Downy Ball. That's something I learned

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,120
today when I excitedly opened a package to find that I had ordered a triple pack of the Downy Ball.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,240
Let's play what is the most humiliating thing that you bought on Amazon just so

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,720
you wouldn't have to go to the store. Justin, I'm assuming your answer is Downy Ball.

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,720
No, for me, the answer is a 40 pound bag of cat litter. That was only because I was afraid my

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,360
spindly, reedy arms wouldn't be able to lug the shit dirt out of the store.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,680
Was that just for the novelty of like, if I didn't have Amazon Prime,

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
this would cost me like $400 to ship.

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
And they ship it in a box and it's a giant box and you get home and you're like,

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,600
oh my God, that's either the ventriloquist dummy I ordered or a big bag of shit dirt.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,760
Or possibly Jimmy Hoffa.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh man, it's the other one, the one I don't want.

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
What? I ordered Centrum chewable vitamins.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,960
But that's, I just didn't, when I'm at the grocery store, I don't think,

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,560
like when I think about getting my VITES at the grocery store, I'll buy a fucking orange.

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,160
Yeah, right. I won't get tablets.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,200
No, you guys are, there's a lot of you guys, 10 million strong and growing.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,520
That's what the ad set tells me.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, it's adults, it's adults, it's like adults chewable vitamins for adults.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Sure, right.

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,480
They do not taste, they do not taste good.

37
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
Why don't they make adult chewables taste, I have these chewable gummy vitamins,

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
not the super fruit gummies that I used to be on, but I have these chewable adult vitamins

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,520
and they are gummy vitamins and they taste terrible.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:32,320
Yeah, it's because things that are good for you can't be good for your senses.

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,560
Right.

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,960
You know what I mean?

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,200
When I was a kid, I once ate like a whole jar of Spider-Man vitamins

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
and they were fucking delicious.

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Fuck, man.

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,560
Wait, what?

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,400
How are your, how is your liver and just, how is all of you after that?

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
He just shit a rock.

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,240
He had so many minerals.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
Yeah, I just shit nutrition.

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
It was amazing.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
Where were our parents during this?

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,240
They were upstairs and it was my Saturday morning snack.

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
This is an advice, did we do the name thing where we said our names?

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
We went straight into box adventures.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
And guys, it's Max Funday.

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Max Funday all day.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
Is it just me or is Max Funday not like way better than Columbus Day?

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
Well, it's because Monsignor Maximum Fund didn't come to a country

63
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
and then kill everybody in it.

64
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Do you think that like, are the people who assigned Columbus Day

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
to be like a national holiday, like deeply regret it

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
once history came to light and they were like,

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
oh shit, well, we can't take it back now.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,640
Now, wait, do you think that they didn't know it first?

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,360
Do you think there were like, it took them a few years to be like,

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
hey, wait a minute, there aren't that many Native Americans.

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
No, I think that what they realized was like,

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
oh, Columbus wasn't the one who discovered America.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
It was a Viking.

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
Well, we'll just keep it Columbus Day

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
because who wants to celebrate Viking Day?

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Wait, that sounds awesome.

77
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,640
Yeah, it sounds actually way better.

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,960
Mutton and what and whatnot.

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,640
Today is Max Fund Day.

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,400
It's the first Max Fund Day.

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,240
It's a, like you said, better than Columbus Day

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
or basically any other holiday.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
What we're trying to do is get some new members

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
to the Maximum Fund family.

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,480
We're going down to the adoption agency.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,880
We are looking through the windows, into the cages

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,440
where they keep the children.

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
And we're gonna take home some babies.

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
We're gonna take home some babies today.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
I wanna walk into an adoption agency and just yell,

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm ready to take home some babies.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
Can I tell you guys something?

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
Seriously, no biscuits here.

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,640
I thought, like for my formative years,

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,160
I really did think the orphanages were like pet stores

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
where like you would go in

97
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
and there would be kids behind glass.

98
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, these fucking babies are priced to move.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,880
And in your mind's eye-

100
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
There's just like sawdust and wood chips at the bottom

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
and the babies are like falling all over each other.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,920
And in your mind's eye, they're all babies too.

103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,240
Cause if they turn five and they don't have a home yet,

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,520
I guess they burn them or something.

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,600
So today we encourage you to go to-

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
We go to encourage you to go to maximumfund.org

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
forward slash maxfundday.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
If you can throw us a $10 a month donation,

109
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
I know it doesn't seem like much money at all,

110
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
but we do some amazing things with that cash.

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
We make Judge John Hodgman.

112
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
We make Memory Palace.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
We make this show.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
We make Throwing Shades.

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Origami Flowers.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
Origami Flowers.

117
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,800
What?

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
Origami Flowers.

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
We make origami flowers from your money

120
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
and then throw it in the garbage.

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
I take wishes

122
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,480
and I put them inside those origami money flowers

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,560
and I set them out onto the lake.

124
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
The Asian lake.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
And then we fire arrows at them

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
and have a Viking burial for your money.

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
So donate, won't you?

128
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,080
We're always adding new shows to the family.

129
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Always adopting new babies.

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,480
This time last year, did we have international waters?

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,960
Did we have, I guess we had JJ Ho.

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
Did we have, we did not have Throwing Shades though.

133
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,040
We certainly didn't have Memory Palace

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,080
and we didn't have Risk.

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
Those are only made possible,

136
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
those shows are made possible because of your gift.

137
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
And we are going to put out,

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,600
as you might be suspecting if you are an existing donor

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
or a new donor,

140
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,360
you're gonna get a special episode

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
of My Brother, My Brother, Me

142
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
that we recorded last night

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
that is, I think it is fair to say,

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,640
unlike any other you have ever experienced.

145
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
It was the super silliest.

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
Here's the tease.

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,640
We gave each other advice.

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
And we were kind of drinking a little bit.

149
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
And so sleepy.

150
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,520
So it got a little tazy.

151
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
It got a little crazy in there.

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
So go to Maximum Fun Day.

153
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,920
Go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Max Fun Day.

154
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,200
And if you're already a member,

155
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
you know, you're already giving, that's great.

156
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
Tell a friend, tweet it out.

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
Tweet that URL out.

158
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
Get into some, we're gonna,

159
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Griffin and I are gonna do a Google Hangout today.

160
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Okay, you wanna go get all the details there.

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
So MaximumFun.org forward slash Max Fun Day is the address.

162
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Please go and help us build something great.

163
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
And now let's get into the advice.

164
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm ready.

165
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm ready.

166
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Do it.

167
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
I guess I'm ready too.

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
Okay, well, you gotta be ready.

169
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
You have no choice.

170
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,480
Fuck.

171
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
About a year ago, he moved into my father-in-law.

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,640
Ow.

173
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
How did he get, hey, get out of there.

174
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,480
He's roomy and spacious, and we encourage others looking for a shelter to join us in his need.

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,520
We knocked out a wall, we turned two rooms into one room, really opened the place up.

176
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Hey, if you're in there, don't knock out any walls.

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
Almost all of them are essential.

178
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
They moved your father-in-law across the country before.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,480
That time he had asked me to call him dad, which was very sweet, meant a lot to me.

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
The issue now is that he's here and it's kind of weird.

181
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,200
I love him very much, but he's not my dad.

182
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,280
So every time I try to make myself call him that,

183
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,600
it just feels wrong and I can't do it.

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,640
At this point, I'm using his first name to talk about it with other people,

185
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,720
and a mishmash of hey, grumpy, and assorted mumbles when I address him directly.

186
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
I can't get past how wrong it seems to call anybody but my actual dad.

187
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Dad, help.

188
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
That's from Who's My Daddy in Cincinnati, which is a nice little bit of-

189
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,080
I like it.

190
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Yeah, a little bit of rhyming, which I appreciate.

191
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,400
You know, in acting, there's this idea of like,

192
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,760
if you try to do an emotional moment and it feels weird,

193
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
it's probably because you did not earn it up to that point.

194
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
So maybe you're just not earning calling him dad.

195
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,680
Maybe you gotta earn it.

196
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
Like go fishing with him and ask him to teach you to whittle.

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Stuff that dads do.

198
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Can I ask why you think grumpy is an acceptable alternative?

199
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
Yeah, grumpy seems like a weird pick.

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,080
Maybe he's grumpy because you call him grumpy.

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
Instead, like, I don't mind if you don't call me daddy,

202
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
but can you please not call me grumpy?

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,920
When I had a friend at church who used to call pooping,

204
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
he would call that grumpy.

205
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
He was gonna make grumpy.

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
The logic being that the face that you make-

207
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,360
It's very much-

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
It's a grumpy face.

209
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,080
That's a very childish thing to say, but I can't hear that word

210
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,720
without thinking of, yeah, I'm getting grumpy.

211
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
Anyway, were we doing a show?

212
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
I'm sorry, did we have a thing we were talking about?

213
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Can you upgrade it to daddy or sweetums or-

214
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Sweets Parappa.

215
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Sweets for fruit.

216
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,440
Sweets Parappa.

217
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,040
And then-

218
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
Hello, Sweets Parappa.

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
If you can stick with that for 48 hours,

220
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
and then when you downgrade it back down to dad,

221
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
it's gonna be great.

222
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,900
Yeah.

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,760
I mean, you've got to let it come naturally.

224
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
If it feels weird to you, then you may not have that relationship.

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
That's what I'm saying.

226
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,520
I didn't call my in-laws mom and dad for quite a long time.

227
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,360
I don't think I've ever heard you call them that.

228
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,160
Yeah, it's something that I call them when I'm feeling very close to them.

229
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,920
When no one's around in the secret times.

230
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,280
No, no, it's something I call when it feels appropriate.

231
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
It doesn't always feel appropriate.

232
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
Sometimes it feels weird, but sometimes it feels appropriate.

233
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
I mean, we're very close now.

234
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,640
We are more like family, and it feels natural,

235
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
but don't try to force it.

236
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,080
I don't even feel comfortable calling Teresa's parents by their first names.

237
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,120
Yeah. There's something about being like, hey, Mike, what's up?

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,280
Something about it seems so informal and disrespectful.

239
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,600
I know that I do call them that,

240
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
but it still is always a catch before I do it.

241
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
It doesn't feel natural yet.

242
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
What we need is an English usted, right?

243
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,400
We need the formal term.

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,840
Usted in Spanish basically means hey you,

245
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,320
which is basically like, hey, you person that is better than me.

246
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,880
You're better than me, and this is me addressing you free of gender.

247
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
That is what we need.

248
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
That is what we need in the English language.

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,920
Hey, you might work, but it feels a little imperative to me.

250
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
Yeah, imperative?

251
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah, it's like your shot.

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,640
It might be, it seems to have an urgency to it that may not always be applicable.

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Yeah.

254
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,160
What we need is just a, just a, like, oh, God, boss, now boss doesn't work.

255
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
Boss man?

256
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,600
I want to, at this point, I rarely, we rarely reference culture on this show.

257
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,640
Your honor.

258
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,240
Your honor, your excellency.

259
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
Ooh, my liege.

260
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,120
But I, this song, this brings to mind a classic country tune,

261
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
the only number one hit for Doug Supernaw.

262
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,520
And the chorus of it goes a little something like this.

263
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.

264
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,960
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh, don't worry, dad, you know it don't matter what we do.

266
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
Cause I don't call him daddy.

267
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
He could never be like you, be like you.

268
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Now, now if you're going to sing that song to your dad with a straight face,

269
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
you don't want to be a liar.

270
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,200
Doug Supernaw did not go to his father and sing that song at his deathbed

271
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
as his stepfather looked on in sadness.

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,080
He did not do that with a heavy heart.

273
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,600
He did it with a clear conscience.

274
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,720
Is it possible, is it possible, Justin, that he did not-

275
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Anything's possible.

276
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,600
Okay, but is it probable that he did not do that at all?

277
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
I am not that close with the Supernaw family.

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,520
Now, was it originally recorded by Kenny Rogers?

279
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes.

280
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,200
Could that, could Kenny Rogers have done that?

281
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,840
Perhaps.

282
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,400
Was he saying that he doesn't call Kenny Rogers daddy?

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,280
No, yes, I'm going to record your song, but I'm not going to call you.

284
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,720
It's not technically Kenny Rogers song.

285
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,440
It was, of course, written by the power duo of Nielsen-Pearson.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
This is like a book on tape of Wikipedia.

287
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,880
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,480
Actually, the guy who wrote it was the first point at which I had to use Wikipedia.

289
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
I know a little bit about country music because this song was really big

290
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,960
at the time when I was a country music DJ named Justin Tyler, so.

291
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Can you permanently just change it to that?

292
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,120
What?

293
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
Justin Tyler.

294
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
It sounds just- We want you out of the family.

295
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not, I don't have shame about my last name.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Just that one sounds a lot better.

297
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,280
If you had some way of tapping into it, there's little in my life I'm embarrassed about.

298
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm not actually embarrassed about this either, but if you had the wherewithal,

299
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,920
you could probably find tapes of me speaking excitedly about the exploits of Tim McGraw.

300
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
Oh, fuck, please, please.

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,800
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody.

302
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
I do remember a news story.

303
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,640
I said where Tim McGraw was talking about Faith Hill's new record and he said,

304
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,840
I think it's sonically the best record she's ever made.

305
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,120
Visually, it's lacking.

306
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,800
Visually, it's lacking.

307
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
Sonically, it's one of her best records ever made.

308
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
And he actually said, I think this is her rumors.

309
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,140
Wow.

310
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
Absolutely perfect.

311
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,000
Christ.

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,520
Can we do everything in our power to make this episode of the podcast Our Rumors?

313
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,840
In fact, we should call this episode Our Rumors.

314
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo?

315
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,520
I do.

316
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,560
You know what I was just thinking about?

317
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
One of the names we almost went with for the show is Bro Your Own Way.

318
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,320
That's true.

319
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah, so good.

320
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
Alt reality.

321
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,200
It could have been.

322
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
This Yahoo was sent in by Steve M. Romaine.

323
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,120
Thank you, Steve M.

324
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Baelin.

325
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:17,760
Baelin, who asks, if horses were people, who do you think they'd vote for?

326
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
My eight-year-old is the more dominant one.

327
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
I think she would try to vote herself as the president.

328
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
My 11-year-old, she'd probably be too lazy to get up there and vote.

329
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,960
But if she could, she'd choose the one with the better tie, XD.

330
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,520
What about your horses?

331
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
Fucking kidding.

332
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Who would you vote for?

333
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,440
I think they'd vote for Ralph Nader.

334
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,840
You damn shit.

335
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
At least I waited until Griffin finished the question.

336
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
I sat on that one for like half an hour.

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,400
You know what?

338
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,360
I appreciate that.

339
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Now, let me just go ahead and tell you that it seemed like a half an hour to you

340
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,200
and your millisecond long attention span.

341
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,720
I think that it is insane to think that horses, if given the ability to vote,

342
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
would vote for different people.

343
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,040
They would be so oppressed that I am almost positive they would be voting as a block.

344
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,000
You would have to woo the horse vote because you would go to whatever candidate is more friendly

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,760
to your cause.

346
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,960
Can I suggest that if a horse could vote, it would probably vote for Salt.

347
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Or, if you will, if we want to make this functional, the saltiest of the two candidates.

348
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,280
Whichever would happen to be holding a crunchy apple at the moment of voting.

349
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,000
Who do you think, if licked, which presidential candidate

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,800
do you think would provide the most flavor?

351
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't think there's a way to not like this about race.

352
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,440
I think that there is and the fact that you just said that is kind of racist.

353
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Okay.

354
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
Here's my deeper question about-

355
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
You know, horses really care about race.

356
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,400
Yeah.

357
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,680
Here's my deeper question about this-

358
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,360
Hold on, because Travis, Travis, Travis, because horses like to race.

359
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
I got you.

360
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,360
God, there's a fucking Laffy Taffy joke in there somewhere.

361
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
If you could find it, people at home.

362
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,360
I want to know what the personality is of this person's 11-year-old horse that makes

363
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
them think that their decision would be based on the tie.

364
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,800
What is it about ties?

365
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,240
Does this horse in his everyday life choose paisley over stripes?

366
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,480
Sure.

367
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,680
Is it, maybe it tried to eat his tie once.

368
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,280
There's no way that we can discuss this without becoming the kind of like sickening whimsy

369
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
that sort of characterizes the Yahoo Answers service.

370
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Griffin, just keep it open mind.

371
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,120
Let's just talk, the horse, like maybe the horse likes to wear ties.

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
Maybe he puts like horse ties on him.

373
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Oh, Christ.

374
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
You can't go into Yahoo Answers with an open mind.

375
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,760
That's how they get you.

376
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
That's how they get you, you have to go and close-minded to protect yourself.

377
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,040
How to touch.

378
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,960
Maybe, you gotta be careful.

379
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
Maybe he's a real close horse.

380
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,920
All right, all right.

381
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Okay, Griffin, what are the answers?

382
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
I will flip the fucking kill switch.

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
Here's, here's what's great.

384
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,080
The top answer is a link to a November 2011 Washington Times article.

385
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,040
And I'd like to read you the lead, if I can.

386
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,120
President Obama last month quietly signed into law a spending bill

387
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,560
that restores the American horse slaughter industry.

388
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,520
Yay!

389
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,960
So Romney?

390
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,720
I guess Romney, but more importantly, yeah, I think that quietly is the only way

391
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
to sign that kind of bill into law.

392
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
He dropped a banner from behind him.

393
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,800
It's not gonna end up in the-

394
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,560
Mission accomplished.

395
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,600
We got him again.

396
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah, I got Obama.

397
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Osama bin Laden.

398
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
You know who else I got?

399
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
All the horses.

400
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
Yeah, Mr. Ed, more like Mr. Dead.

401
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
Peace out, horses.

402
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,480
I hate you.

403
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
Obama, 2012.

404
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,560
Answer three.

405
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,600
That's a tough one.

406
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,840
On the one hand, my horses would fit better with the Republican

407
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
just leave me alone and stay out of my business mentality.

408
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Oh my God.

409
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,840
But on the other hand, they'd like to be taken care of by the government,

410
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
like Democrats.

411
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,040
Oh God, horses are a generous people, you know?

412
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I don't think that, I think that it's a fallacy to think that horses

413
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
wouldn't also want to take care of people.

414
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,920
Am I wrong?

415
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,800
Am I wrong about this?

416
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
Horses are free.

417
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
When you ride a horse, it's like borrowing wings from God.

418
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,520
Two riders, one heart is basically what I'm saying to you.

419
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Sure, yeah.

420
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,960
I think, I think they would probably go GOP.

421
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Yeah, gallop an old party.

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
Because I'll tell you why, because they hate donkeys, I guess.

423
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Sure, sure, yeah.

424
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
That joke, I got about 20% of the way through making that joke.

425
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
And then I started googling stuff and instead.

426
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
Did you say you started googling stuff or stuffing?

427
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,440
Because I myself would like to know how I'm going to save everyone without resorting to

428
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,240
water chestnuts.

429
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,920
It's impossible.

430
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,760
Hey, I have a question.

431
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,040
I'm in my third year of college and I'm looking for funny movie plots I can turn into short

432
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,240
student films.

433
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
Any suggestions?

434
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
And this is from Hoosh.

435
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,440
Now guys, this isn't a typical question that we answer.

436
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,200
And I just want to take a moment to say you're better than this, Hoosh.

437
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,960
How?

438
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,720
So you put this question, I want to make it clear here.

439
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,560
You, you composed the question list this week.

440
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,440
You put this in strictly to shame Hoosh.

441
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
I wanted to shame Hoosh because Hoosh, you're better than this.

442
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,240
You're, I, you do not think you can come to our door with your, with your hollowed out

443
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,640
pumpkin, knock on a door, trick or treat and get us to throw the fun sized baby Ruth of

444
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,160
our inspiration into your, into your bucket.

445
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,640
It's, it's unfair and it's hurtful, Hoosh.

446
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
And you're better than it.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,320
Plus, I am not going to crack open my black and white notebook to give you all of my hilarious

448
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,840
short student film ideas.

449
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,600
The other reason I added this question is because I thought Travis probably had a few

450
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
that he could spare.

451
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,200
I, I every day, I burp and a movie idea comes out.

452
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,760
Yeah.

453
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,400
It got to the point when, when Travis is younger, where I told him that in order to, in order

454
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
to listen to more of his plots for movies, he had to make one.

455
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
I remember that.

456
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Just one.

457
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,240
And once he made one movie out of one of these plots, I would listen.

458
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
It could cycle forward.

459
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
The cue had failed.

460
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,240
And it was like he had attended the Dawson Leary School of Cinematic Conceptualizing

461
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
because he'd be like, tell me your idea, please.

462
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,160
And you'd be like, witches?

463
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
You're like, ah, cool, cool.

464
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,040
I, I, that's not fair.

465
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
Some were quite good.

466
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
Travis did, in fact, write the entirety of Inception.

467
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,600
That's true.

468
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,440
And it got, it got taken from him.

469
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,760
Ironically.

470
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,160
But my, my ending was quite different.

471
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah.

472
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,680
Good.

473
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,520
In his ending, the top just fell over.

474
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
There was a, there was a sense of finality to it.

475
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,120
And then there was like a Benny Hill type chase scene.

476
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,040
And then Leo walks over and picks up his top.

477
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,240
He's like, thank goodness.

478
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm glad this isn't, glad to be home with my family.

479
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,280
That's good.

480
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
Travis, Travis hates ambiguity.

481
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
That's his, that's his bugaboo.

482
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,600
I do.

483
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,040
I hate, I do legit hate any movie that you're supposed to walk out of going,

484
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,320
God, I just don't, I'm not sure.

485
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
I think so.

486
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
What do you, I want to know.

487
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,160
I want me and the person next to me to know the same thing about the movie.

488
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm going to walk out being like, yeah, so it was the dad, right?

489
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,960
It was the dad.

490
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,440
Yeah, cool.

491
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,920
Cool.

492
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,760
So in your version of No Country for Old Men, Tommy Lee Jones is sitting there

493
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,080
and he's talking to his wife about the dream that he had about the man with the fire.

494
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
And then he picks up the local paper and he says,

495
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
oh, it looks like somebody else got Anton Chigurh.

496
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,880
And then, then the credits roll.

497
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
That sounds like a better movie in fairness.

498
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,040
That does sound actually very good.

499
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
That sounds pretty good actually.

500
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,480
At the end of Benny Hill music played.

501
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,720
Yep.

502
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
I got another question for you.

503
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,720
Quickie, how long into relationship do you think it becomes weird to not say I love you?

504
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
My boyfriend and I have been going out for a year and have not said it.

505
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Even though I know the feeling is there.

506
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,920
That's from anonymous.

507
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you, are you waiting for him to say it?

508
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
Why haven't you said it?

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
Ooh, you think it's a chicken situation.

510
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,520
I, I, I could see that being a real possibility of both people feeling it.

511
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,160
If you know the love is there, both people feeling it,

512
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,200
but being afraid to say it and not wanting to be like, oh, we're in love, right?

513
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
Like that's awkward.

514
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
So maybe just say it.

515
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,920
And if after a year he's like, oh, what?

516
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,280
Oh, then it's probably best you find that out.

517
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,080
If you don't go ahead and say it, this is going to turn into a thing where

518
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,560
you're going to wake up one of these days.

519
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,600
And it may, I may not be tomorrow, but it's going to be soon.

520
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,560
You're going to wake up and realize that it would be weird to say it at this point.

521
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,040
Yeah.

522
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Mm hmm.

523
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,120
Oh, I can't.

524
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,320
I mean, I can't do it now.

525
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
If I wasn't going to do it before, like I can't like say, I love you now.

526
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,200
It would be weird.

527
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,920
This is a conversation I've had and heard many times that,

528
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
how long did you guys wait before you said it?

529
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
Can you imagine being at a party and someone asks you that question right now?

530
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,600
And you both like knew that you had never told each other.

531
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,440
That's going to ruin the relationship.

532
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,480
Can I tell you something?

533
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Just say, I love you.

534
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
Just say, I love you.

535
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,960
I love you.

536
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,760
You love the person.

537
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
You've been with them for a year and you haven't put a steak knife through their neck.

538
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
You love them.

539
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah.

540
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640
That's love.

541
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Maybe you could start out by saying things that sound like I love you

542
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
and see if you like how it feels.

543
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,520
Elephant shoes?

544
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Or maybe like, even step, step back even further from that and be like, Danny Glover.

545
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,280
And then see if, see how that treats you sonically.

546
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,200
If it's sonic, if it, if it is the rumor.

547
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,480
Is it your rumors?

548
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,520
If it's your rumors of talk of words that you've shared.

549
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,280
Saying I love you is my rumors.

550
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,080
Hey guys, I'm, I don't say this enough.

551
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,120
And I want you to know, I really, I don't want to bring things down, but I really do mean it.

552
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
Danny Glover, you both.

553
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,960
Thank you, Griffin.

554
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
Danny Glover, you too.

555
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
Danny Glover, you too, Griffin.

556
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,080
Danny Glover, everyone.

557
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,920
Guys, I do not Danny Glove that joke.

558
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,720
Me neither.

559
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
I'm not, I'm, I maybe Donald Glover it.

560
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,680
Yeah.

561
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,560
I don't, I don't.

562
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,280
Unrelated.

563
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,080
Can you believe it?

564
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,120
Can you believe it?

565
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
Now, wait, hold the phone.

566
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,680
I know how you're going to, I know how you're going to spin this.

567
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,560
But that's not what I meant.

568
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,640
No, no spinning required.

569
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
Just shove it a little bit forward.

570
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,840
Wait, what are we talking about?

571
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,000
Travis just said that everyone, he says that all black Glovers should be related.

572
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
I don't think that, I don't think.

573
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
I did not say should be.

574
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
I assume it's Hollywood.

575
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,720
I assume nepotism.

576
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
That's the only reason I thought it was weird.

577
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,760
That's exactly what it was.

578
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,080
Okay.

579
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay.

580
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,440
When I found out Adam Baldwin wasn't related to the Baldwins, I was surprised.

581
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank you.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,200
Was I racist?

583
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,040
That's a great, thank you, Travis.

584
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,240
Yes, that is a fine point.

585
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,280
That's not racist.

586
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,760
But the Baldwins have a history of nepotism.

587
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Danny Glover, Danny Glover's worked hard to get where he is.

588
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
And so has Donald Glover.

589
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,960
That's all I'm saying.

590
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
The only thing I, listen, you don't have, we don't have to fight about this.

591
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,560
The only thing I'm saying is that you're a horrid racist.

592
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,760
I am not a horrid racist.

593
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,920
And on the off chance that Donald Glover hears this bit, I want him to know how much I respect

594
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,480
him deeply.

595
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,240
Well, fuck that guy.

596
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,720
You know what?

597
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,200
You know, there's only one God I serve.

598
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Who's that?

599
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,640
Money.

600
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
I love him.

601
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
Danny Glover him so much.

602
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
I want to talk about Origins of State.

603
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
Origins of State is a performance company in Brooklyn.

604
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,080
They are holding a ritual dinner, a dinner ritual based on the Passover cedar about the

605
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,360
story of America.

606
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
And that runs before and after the weekend at Max Fun Con East.

607
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,400
You can dine and remake America from the company Jesse Torn once dubbed the quote greatest

608
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,760
theatrical experience of all time.

609
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
Now seating is, I know seating is super limited.

610
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,800
They have nine seats per night.

611
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,040
Jesus, I have but I've got I've got nine friends and I want to go.

612
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
You can't go to kill one of your friends.

613
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah, there is.

614
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
Yeah, there's nine seats at the table per night.

615
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,920
So it's it is basically the most limited seating there can be.

616
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,680
But it looks let's change that.

617
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
Let's change that word to exclusive.

618
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
Oh, I like that.

619
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,040
And while we're changing inclusive say there while we're changing things, let's go back

620
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,120
to when Justin said Cedar and let's change it to the correct pronunciation.

621
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,440
Cedar Cedar is a delicious smelling wood.

622
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Cedar is like a super it's like a super delicious religious dinner.

623
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,040
Is it Cedar?

624
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,160
It's Cedar.

625
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,480
Cedar is the wood.

626
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:59,680
Yes, the greatest theatrical experience of all time and the basically also the best wood

627
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
have finally joined to present the wood.

628
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,840
I take that back.

629
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,640
The table might be what the chairs might be what I don't want to assume.

630
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,840
There you go, dipshit.

631
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,120
So go to you want to go to tickets dot organs of state.

632
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,880
That's O-R-G-A-N-S-O-F-S-T-A-T-E dot org.

633
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,800
And and look into that because it sounds fascinating.

634
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,720
It sounds like something I'd love to go to.

635
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,480
If you're anywhere in the Brooklyn area, you're going to want to check that out.

636
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,480
You sound like a real student of Hebrew traditions.

637
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
Yeah, all right.

638
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,360
Just for the record, by the way, that's October 19th, 20th, 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th,

639
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
and then November 1st to the 4th.

640
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
So there's a lot of opportunities to see it.

641
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,280
Don't miss it.

642
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,080
Don't pass this one over this event.

643
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,880
Fuck.

644
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,280
Got it.

645
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,320
Nailed it.

646
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,440
And for Henry from Alyssa, we have some goodwill to you.

647
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,040
Henry's a wonderful boyfriend.

648
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,160
He introduced Alyssa to my bim bam and everything else worth knowing,

649
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,480
including one presumes his body.

650
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,160
He is sassy and smart and attractive.

651
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,000
And all he asked for as a birthday gift was a message on this very Jumbotron.

652
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Don't worry.

653
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,640
I got him extra things anyway.

654
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
And some of them are sexy.

655
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh, I love you, Henry.

656
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,360
Gravel?

657
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,840
Graveal?

658
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,360
Greenville?

659
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,880
It's actually pronounced Sater.

660
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,760
Sater!

661
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
Happy birthday.

662
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,560
Justin, in all the time, 124 episodes, I have never been made sad by a thing you said

663
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,160
until you said his body.

664
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,160
Then I was made sad.

665
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
That was your thing, huh?

666
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,280
That was the one thing that Griffin-

667
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
It was the tone of voice that you had said it in

668
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
and the way that you took this wonderful birthday message

669
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,160
and spun it into what's the opposite of gold?

670
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,920
You spun it into evil crap.

671
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,760
I truly am surprised that we managed to take something sweet and innocent

672
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
and then corrupt it into something bad.

673
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Yeah, it's a first ever.

674
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,720
It's a first ever.

675
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,680
Oh, no, wait.

676
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,840
We're a fucking conveyor belt that goes through a cardboard box

677
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,920
and the cardboard box is bad on it.

678
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,240
And then there's a special robot there and he's got a shaker

679
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,840
and inside that shaker is concentrated bad and he puts it on there.

680
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
Let's not ruin Mark Little's message in the same way.

681
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Okay.

682
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,640
Griffin, hit me, damn it.

683
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
Okay, fuck.

684
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,520
This one's for Mark Little from Eric Harmony and Rebecca who say,

685
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,800
happy birthday.

686
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,840
This isn't as good as a jet pack, but we hope it will do.

687
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,680
We love you tons from your brother, your wife, and your sister-in-law.

688
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
Wait, who says this isn't as good as a jet pack?

689
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm tired of people downplaying the importance of the Jumbotron as a gift.

690
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,440
First, Alyssa went and got Henry other things,

691
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
which, how do you think that makes us feel?

692
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,960
You know?

693
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
Pretty, pretty good.

694
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Well, we can't-

695
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,040
Thank you for getting him material goods.

696
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,800
Let's, well, it may, it's sexy.

697
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,000
You know what I mean?

698
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
It's also good for the economy.

699
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,720
We can't give him that.

700
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,200
We can't.

701
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
I can't be that for you, Henry.

702
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,440
We can't, you know, we can't grab Rod Stewart and never let go.

703
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
You know what I mean?

704
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Rod Stewart is the name of his penis.

705
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,360
When I buy sexy things, you know where I turn?

706
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
Did you guess Extreme Machines.com?

707
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,480
Well, if you've listened to this show at any point for the past two months,

708
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,640
I bet you did guess Extreme Machines.com.

709
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,040
You probably saw that segue coming, felt it in your way down deep.

710
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,200
You might have said it along with it.

711
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,320
Yeah, you probably, yeah.

712
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,720
It's like a, it's like a romper room bit at this point.

713
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
You're just, the kids at home are shouting along with you.

714
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,840
Go to Extreme Machines!

715
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
That's right, kids.

716
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,160
Coupon Code Middle East!

717
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,600
There is nothing that makes me happier than the fact that our show is now,

718
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,640
I, how do I put, synonymous?

719
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,520
Is that, is that overstating the point?

720
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,600
It's definitely a symbiotic relationship.

721
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,800
You may be hearing this thinking,

722
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,280
I already bought a dildo from Extreme Restraints.

723
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,000
Why don't you go buy another one and then you got Lummi Stix?

724
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,120
Oh, God bless.

725
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,080
You know, if you want to treat your cyborg right,

726
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,960
I just, I'd entreat you to go to the Electro Sex Gear section of the site.

727
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,600
They got that Zeus Electro Sex Torpedo Plug.

728
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,760
They got the Zeus Electro Sex Clamps.

729
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,400
I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, Justin,

730
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,920
but for the past, I would say three episodes, maybe more,

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,800
whenever you have to turn to anecdotal sex toy,

732
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,800
suggests you always go to electricity.

733
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,240
It's very-

734
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,280
You got a Tesla thing?

735
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,160
Yeah.

736
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,840
Yeah, I guess I just get a charge out of it.

737
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,400
Oh no, why is this show so bad?

738
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:49,760
When you do things, do you like alternating or direct current?

739
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
This show is so bad, it's shocking.

740
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,680
Holy fuck, can we stop the shallotry?

741
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,600
Can we put the shallotry to bed?

742
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,480
I actually used inferior sexual electric toys

743
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,600
to shock pets in my neighborhood

744
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,800
and killed them to show how dangerous they were.

745
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,240
Oh, okay, for a second there,

746
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,040
I thought this was like a fun story from your childhood.

747
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,040
No, it was a reference to something that Edison did

748
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,920
because he was a creep.

749
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
He's a cock.

750
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,640
Yeah, don't shock the local kitty cats.

751
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,680
What you do is you shock the monkey.

752
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,960
Shock the pussy.

753
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,040
No, wait, yes.

754
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Shock the pussy, come on now.

755
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,880
You should do that, but not in that tone of voice.

756
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
Shock the pussy!

757
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,880
Justin is gonna single-handedly take that word back

758
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,800
from whom I do not know,

759
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
but when he does it, he's gonna be armed

760
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,360
with that pronunciation.

761
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't know who has pussy.

762
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,200
I need to go to the copyright office.

763
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Now when you say it like that, it makes me uncomfortable.

764
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
Pussy.

765
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,520
When you add like an O or two into the word.

766
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:11,440
It sounded like you were playing some sort of pussy theremin.

767
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
Fucking say the link right!

768
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,320
Fuck with the giant rubber electric dildo.

769
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,200

There it is.

Explode your pussy.

775
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
Explode your pussy.

776
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
Do yourself a favor.

777
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
With the power of Zeus.

778
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
Explode your pussy.

779
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,920
And don't forget to go to maximumfun.org forward slash maxfunday

780
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,800
right now when you're having this much fun.

781
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
Where else can you hear the word pussy 5,000 times in 10 minutes?

782
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,480
It'll explode your pussy in another way.

783
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,600
A more altruistic way.

784
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,800
Your mental pussy.

785
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Did we mention that every $10 and $20 new donor,

786
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,760
they're gonna give food for enough food for 20 meals

787
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,000
at the local Los Angeles food bank.

788
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Did you know that?

789
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,000
I bet you didn't know that.

790
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,240
Go explode your pussy.

791
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
It's not all about pussies and dildos, you guys.

792
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,360
It's about helping people.

793
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,280
If my donation's going to the Los Angeles food bank,

794
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,080
there is a good chance that Harlan Williams

795
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,280
is gonna be eating off of your generosity tonight.

796
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
And Griffin Ozen big.

797
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,160
Hey, my pregnant wife just ate 18 bagel bites for lunch.

798
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,240
Should I be concerned about how this will affect her

799
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,360
and my unborn child?

800
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,200
That's from pizza blasted in the peach state.

801
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Oh no.

802
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Honey?

803
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,720
Honey?

804
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,600
Should you stop?

805
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,240
Okay, okay, okay.

806
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,560
Were some of those supposed to be for me?

807
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
Did I miss my window?

808
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,800
Do you think that this is the person's real protest?

809
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Baby, should you have heated those first?

810
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Your teeth are broken.

811
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,200
Is it bad that when I heard you read that,

812
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,720
the first thing I thought of was the little pizza bites.

813
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,880
Pizza rolls.

814
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,600
Pizza rolls.

815
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,480
That's what I initially thought of and I got yucked out.

816
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,000
But then when I made the realization

817
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,680
that we're talking about bagel bites here,

818
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,800
I was like, well, okay.

819
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,600
Well, the reason is because the bagel bites are so flexible.

820
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,640
Hold on, hold on everybody.

821
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,320
Justin's singing the pizza, the pizza bagels song.

822
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,960
Let me try again.

823
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,800
Do you want to do it in chorus, Justin?

824
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,200
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
We'll just start and we'll do harmony.

826
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,600
Justin just decided that he wants a good eight seconds

827
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,520
of the show where nothing funny happens.

828
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,840
Go on.

829
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,640
You ready?

830
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
All right.

831
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
I don't call him daddy.

832
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
He didn't scare me.

833
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
When you pick me up on Friday,

834
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
are you going to bring me bagel bites?

835
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,920
Oh, don't worry.

836
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
Dad, you know, it don't matter which flavor.

837
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't call daddy because he doesn't have bagel bites.

838
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,480
Okay.

839
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,880
I love.

840
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,920
There definitely needs to be a version of that song

841
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
where his allegiances change so quickly

842
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,160
based on which hand is feeding bagel bites down his throat.

843
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
It could be even more mundane things.

844
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,040
I don't call daddy.

845
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
He didn't take me to the mall.

846
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,880
What you saying earlier?

847
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
You wanted to go to the mall.

848
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
I don't call him daddy.

849
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,000
But if you don't get me some fun dip, I'm gone now.

850
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
And I'm going to start calling you Jeff.

851
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,000
Do you want to be demoted to Jeff?

852
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,920
Do you want to be fun dip Jeff?

853
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,240
You guys know that every country music song

854
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,440
has to have the word twang in it somewhere.

855
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,280
I don't call him daddy, but I could sure use a sugar glider.

856
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,560
They're like mice, but they can fly.

857
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,960
And they really need all your love.

858
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,360
Sugar gliders will die if you don't pet them every 30 seconds.

859
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,240
Did you guys know that?

860
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,000
That was told to me by a man at the West Virginia Pumpkin Festival today.

861
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
They're selling sugar gliders for $400.

862
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,520
Fuck, that's a lot of money.

863
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,240
That seems like a weird impulse buy at the Pumpkin Festival.

864
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Thank you, Travis.

865
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,800
That is specifically what I said.

866
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,160
Thank you.

867
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,560
You didn't-

868
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,440
You just walked into the Pumpkin Festival like,

869
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,040
ooh, jar of pumpkin butter.

870
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,520
Oh, okay, I can get that little scarecrow, man.

871
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,200
Ooh, $400 sugar glider.

872
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,000
I just happen to have $400 cash in my pocket.

873
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,960
Because if there's anything I know about Justin

874
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,600
and his reaction to small animals

875
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,360
that shouldn't be in places where they are,

876
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
your initial reaction when you look at a rat is,

877
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
man, I wish that thing could get airborne.

878
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's just get that up in the sky.

879
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,000
Can I get you closer to my line of sight?

880
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,720
Can I get you up in my eyes and face region?

881
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,800
That would treat me so right.

882
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
If you could just do that for me.

883
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,200
You bought it, right?

884
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,160
I bought four.

885
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,120
They're gonna be a family.

886
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,520
They can pet each other,

887
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,040
keep each other alive through the winter.

888
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,560
Alvin and the Chipmunks and his other stupid brother

889
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,520
ain't got nothing on me.

890
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
I got four sugar gliders.

891
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,320
They run in a circle and shit.

892
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,120
Wait, hold on, hold on.

893
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
What other stupid brother?

894
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,160
What?

895
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,320
Well, no, because I bought four.

896
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,040
There's only three.

897
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,880
I bought four gliders.

898
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,920
There's three Chipmunks.

899
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,400
So they gotta get a fourth one to even get in the game with me.

900
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,200
They gotta recruit a non-singing, like, regular Chipmunk.

901
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,560
This is our brother, Steven the Chipmunk,

902
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,720
and he just does all of our electric work.

903
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,520
The Chipmunk version of bonus Jonas.

904
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,040
Oh, bonus Jonas.

905
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,160
I hope he's doing okay.

906
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
I haven't heard about him in a while.

907
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,480
Yeah, exactly.

908
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
You wanna Yahoo?

909
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,100
Please.

910
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
That's your cue to do that.

911
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,280
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.

912
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,800
This one was sent in by JP Grant.

913
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
Thanks, JP Grant.

914
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,120
It's almost identical to the last question.

915
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,420
Okay.

916
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,240
Theme show.

917
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,560
I hate-

918
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,520
It's by Alvin and his user, Devin, who asked,

919
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,400
I hate my life because I just ate 17 bowls of oatmeal.

920
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,200
What should I do?

921
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,920
It's actionable, this advice, because it's direct questions.

922
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
If the wife had said, I just ate 18 bagel bites.

923
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,240
What's my next step?

924
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,040
What's, yeah, what's my next thing?

925
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,520
This guy, he done did it already, and he needs to know where to turn.

926
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,200
He adds, I thought it would be fun.

927
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,720
Now I just hurt everywhere.

928
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,280
Please help.

929
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,600
What?

930
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,900
What?

931
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Wait, I think, I know how, can you imagine how those last few bites must have felt?

932
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,540
Just slopping it in.

933
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,660
This wasn't fun at all.

934
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,700
What have I done?

935
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,820
I imagine from bowl eight on, it was like that scene in Matilda.

936
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:41,940
Yeah, right.

937
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,420
With no kids chanting.

938
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,500
No kids are chanting for you to eat the cake.

939
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,980
The horrifying cake the old woman put her blood in, I think.

940
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,500
Now for real, you guys, this, what we're seeing here is the direct negative influence

941
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,260
that is man versus food.

942
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,660
You think this is a man versus food?

943
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,980
Oh, people aren't really making their own MVF challenges at home.

944
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,460
All the kids, they watch the man versus food, and they just think it looks so cool,

945
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,500
and they think, why not me?

946
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,340
This week on Dale versus food, I'm gonna eat all my DVDs.

947
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,980
And that's how people die.

948
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,040
Yeah.

949
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,100
That's not the only way people die.

950
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,740
That's it.

951
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,220
It's the number one cause.

952
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,940
Until now, death had never been introduced into the cosmos.

953
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,460
It's the number one cause.

954
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,580
It's the number one cause of death among men named Dale.

955
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,100
I have never been tempted.

956
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,940
I don't call him Dale, because everybody I know named Dale is dead.

957
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,140
They ate something in their house.

958
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,580
It wasn't technically food.

959
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,820
How bored do you have to be to look at a table with oatmeal on it and be like,

960
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,260
yeah, this is gonna be fun.

961
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,300
Yeah, here we go.

962
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,860
Buckle up.

963
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,900
This is what I'm doing today.

964
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,580
I do want to make a point though about, I wouldn't eat 17 bowls of oatmeal,

965
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,100
but can we just agree that those packets, the suggested surfing sizes-

966
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,060
It's two at once.

967
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,220
At least, at least two at once.

968
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,580
You gotta do two, right?

969
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,540
It's a joke.

970
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,020
Yeah.

971
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,700
If nobody eats that much oatmeal-

972
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,420
It's three.

973
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,620
It's a three packet day.

974
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:18,660
Wow.

975
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,020
I mean, super early, and it's like 5 AM, and I know I'm not gonna eat lunch till two.

976
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,980
I need three packets.

977
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,580
That third one's gonna kick in like the red logs and back to the future three,

978
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,340
and it's gonna burst me through the day.

979
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,060
I've managed to...

980
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,500
I've actually cut back to one pack and a patch.

981
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,460
I'm deeply impressed, Griffin.

982
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,500
An oatmeal patch?

983
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,380
Mm-hmm.

984
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,620
Is Cream of Wheat oatmeal, technically?

985
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

986
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,020
It's actually, its technical, like its scientific Latin name is slor.

987
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,100
It's technically what it is.

988
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,300
Cream of Wheat is wheat, and oatmeal is oats.

989
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,420
They're two different families, and they are both loved by horses.

990
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,540
Where's Cocoa Wheats falling?

991
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,340
Cocoa Wheats are fucking wallpaper paste.

992
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,180
No, Cocoa Wheats, Cocoa Wheats can't be beat.

993
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,140
How many more jingles can we do?

994
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,900
Let's do 10 more jingles till the end of the show.

995
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:22,420
Oh, worst review ever on the AV Club.

996
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,100
They kept singing jingles.

997
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,140
No stars.

998
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,100
AV Club out.

999
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,140
I don't call him daddy, because he brings me Cocoa Wheats.

1000
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,860
I don't even sell those anymore.

1001
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,620
It's like Bosco.

1002
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,620
That's not even a product that's for sale.

1003
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,540
They just accidentally left the commercials on.

1004
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,020
I saw Ovaltine at the store yesterday.

1005
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,460
I checked it to see if there was a picture of Ronald Reagan on it somewhere.

1006
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,260
Give me a thumbs up.

1007
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,020
I endorse this.

1008
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,180
I endorse this milk powder.

1009
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,620
Oh, you know, that's not half bad.

1010
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,100
I was going to say, that might be the best impression you've ever done on the show.

1011
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,700
Let's stop it.

1012
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,180
Maximumfun.org forward slash Max Fun Day.

1013
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,820
Come join our family.

1014
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,100
Help someone in need and get that bonus episode,

1015
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,300
because I bet after listening to this, what you're thinking is,

1016
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,980
God damn, I wish there was more of that.

1017
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,820
If it makes you feel it hurts, not just us,

1018
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,020
you'll get episodes from other Max Fun shows as well.

1019
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,060
Oh, yeah, but they might make sense.

1020
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,380
Yeah.

1021
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,460
Or not be covertly racist.

1022
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,060
So what's the point?

1023
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,140
Don't waste your megabits on that.

1024
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,060
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1025
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,940
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1026
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:47,860
Thank you.

1027
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,860
Thank you for the gift of your music.

1028
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,900
Can we say that?

1029
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,020
Is it weird to say that?

1030
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,860
No, it's a beautiful gift.

1031
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,060
Thank you, Daddy, for your gift of music.

1032
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,460
Thanks.

1033
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,900
I don't call him Daddy, because he's any musician, John Roderick.

1034
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,740
But I do appreciate him loaning us his tune.

1035
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,900
Can we thank all the Twitters?

1036
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,660
Yeah, people have been tweeting about the show a lot lately.

1037
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,220
I think people-

1038
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,340
And by lately, you mean the two days that have passed since we last recorded the show.

1039
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,860
Oh, my God, I can't even think about it.

1040
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,620
I want to say thank you to our favorite fan.

1041
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,940
Well, our favorite fan this week, Lin-Manuel.

1042
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,140
Oh, you might know him as the Tony Award-winning musical producer.

1043
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,780
It's no big deal.

1044
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,180
Why are we bragging?

1045
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,220
What?

1046
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,740
Oh, I don't know, it's not a big deal.

1047
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,340
It's just like, you know, if Lin-Manuel Miranda just tweets a video at you that says,

1048
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,140
hey, you got to check this out, it's like, makes me feel pretty good.

1049
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,860
Which, by the way, was the coolest video I've ever seen.

1050
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,820
It was a really good video.

1051
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,540

00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:54,580
Oh, Daniel Corsetto, who's another webcomic artist that I'm a fan of,

1070
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,260
started listening to this show.

1071
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,900
We are joining the army of webcomic.

1072
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Guys, why don't we just stop doing the show?

1073
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,100
Why are we even doing this?

1074
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,740
We can crowdsource all of our shit out to webcomic artists.

1075
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,900
And if somebody wants to do like an MBM webcomic, go for it.

1076
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,780
No theme.

1077
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,340
No, don't.

1078
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,420
They got to do like licensing deals.

1079
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,700
Oh, OK, so like license, whatever that means.

1080
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,260
License it.

1081
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,980
Get a license.

1082
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,740
OK, Travis, you're just you're just losing it.

1083
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,140
You're losing your mind right now, Travis.

1084
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,220
We're watching it.

1085
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,340
We're watching you lose it.

1086
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,540
You're losing it right now.

1087
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,700
This, all kidding aside, and I know we like to have some fun here,

1088
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:43,620
but it really does mean a lot to us that you guys listen to the show and support the show.

1089
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,540
I don't know, it just it makes me feel really good when people that are so cool,

1090
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:57,620
like Danielle Corsette or so many others, and even commenters who don't have a lot of followers,

1091
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,780
when you guys support our show and listen to our show week in and week out,

1092
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,260

1093
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,420

But probably not.

1102
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,660
Probably not.
