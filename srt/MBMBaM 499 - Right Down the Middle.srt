1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, welcome to My Brother, my brother and mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and this one's going right over the plate,

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
right in it, right over the middle of the plate. Oh, like it's a perfect strike?

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
This one's going to be a perfect strike. Well, no, because even that sounds like it

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,680
takes a lot of effort. This one's going to be by the books, huh?

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
Oh, okay. Second base.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
This one's going to get you to second base. This is a ground rule double. I don't know

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
what that means. A lot of people are like,

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,160
four, nine, nine. There must be ramping up and it's like, nah, we're not evil Knievel.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,560
You know what I mean? We don't need an approach game. This one's going to be right over the plate

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,800
and then the next one's going to be fucking wild.

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,200
We're walking this bat. This is the batter where-

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
This batter is going to walk.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,280
We're going to walk this one because we know the next one's an easy out, but this one,

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,160
oh, this is the big slugger who scares us because earlier in the season,

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,080
he got that grand slam off of us to lose the big game and now we're a little nervous around him,

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,480
so we might walk him. But what's that? Oh, Travis is coming in here and he's not ready to walk him.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,920
He's got blood in his eyes. He might kill this batter.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,880
I guarantee you will finish this episode of the podcast and say out loud, fine.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Yeah.

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
They recorded audio into microphones for an hour.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Anybody can do that. I don't want it to say it's going to be bad.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Okay.

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
It's going to be fine.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
It's going to be an episode.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Juice, it might be great, but I'll tell you this much.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
It's going to be a lot like the other episodes.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,640
Yeah.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,240
This one's going to get-

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,400
This is the big unit that Travis's analogy was perfect.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,040
This episode's Mark McGuire. We're going to pass on him.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
We're going to let him go on to first so he doesn't do a lot of real damage

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,200
before fucking Big Papi gets up here on 500 and slams one.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,120
This is the thing is like, no matter how well we did on this,

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
this might end up being our greatest episode yet,

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
but I think it would be rare to find somebody who would look at 500 episodes,

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
like the 500th episode even, and say,

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
oh yeah, but the most special one was 499.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,400
No, that's not-

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
I just think that-

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,600
That's weird.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Here's what I'd say.

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's what I'd say, okay?

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Okay, yeah.

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,880
498 perfect episodes, okay?

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,440
Yeah.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,120
Certainly, certainly, dear listeners, I think you would agree, we've earned one.

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Right.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,560
For us.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,960
I can't believe-

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,280
Not bad. Just for us.

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,800
It's just- Go listen to episode 361.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
This one's going to be like that.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,560
I just assume it's not a live show or whatever the fuck.

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
This one's going to be like episode 127, right?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,240
It's just going to be a fucking episode.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,840
Close your eyes and picture your platonic ideal of a my brother,

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
my brother and me episode.

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,320
This is going to be it.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,680
This is the Venn diagram of normal episodes, and this one is going to be one circle.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
We're going to do yahoos, we're going to have fun.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,400
But like, don't expect us to set some shit up.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
No.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
This is not the Rosetta Stone you need to understand episode 500.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,000
This one's Mark McGuire MLB former home run record holder.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,240
But now Griffin you ran-

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,560
Don't lower your expectations either.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,960
No.

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
No, it's going to be fine.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
It could be good.

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Griffin, you randomly pulled the 361, and I think that this episode,

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
I would like to do this a few times.

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm going to just click out a random number generator and return to some great episodes.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
I don't want to play clips from them.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
I just like this.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,120
So in 361, see if any of this.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
Hashtag Mambo number five.

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,840
Nope.

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
Nipple shrapnel.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,400
No.

88
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
A frequency situation.

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
No.

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Fondue rules.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Fondue rules.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
That rings something of a bell.

93
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Navy Beans, Frials, and Nasier.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
It sounds like one of the-

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,760
Oh wait.

96
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,800
Frials and Nasier.

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
That sounds like one we talked about Frasier in that one.

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,600
Yeah.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
That's got to be, yeah.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
Hey, but we don't normally reminisce on this show.

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,920
This one's got to be by the books, Jews.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,160
So.

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Well, no, I want it to be by the books.

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Yeah.

106
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
We've never made a call back before, Griffin.

107
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,560
Never successfully.

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,120
No, no, no.

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,200
We're not, see a call back implies that we're just recycling bits.

110
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,080
Uh-huh.

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,560
I want to just return to the randomly selected episode 141,

112
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,120
Dan the man with the flan plan.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh no, I know that one.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Fun to say.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,680
February 2013, so young, favorite Oscars.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Squatting.

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,400
Okay.

118
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,960
Eye butt.

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,200
That sounds like a fruitful period.

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Big city living.

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay.

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Dansexual.

123
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Now that one I remember.

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,120
How rich, what a rich tapestry we were weaving.

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
What a rich time that was.

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,280
Did you say, did you say eye butt?

127
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Was that lowercase I, big B butt, like it was from Apple?

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,640
Lord almighty, that's good.

129
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,760
An eye butt is one, is one that was in here.

130
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,720
That's a very powerful, that's a powerful turn of phrase.

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
What might be a fun game is what is the most recent episode

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
that I can't remember a fucking lick of a thing about?

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,360
Cause I bet it's pretty, I bet it's shockingly recent.

134
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,680
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,040
Yeah.

136
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,400
466, just pulled that out of my butt.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,880
That would have been 23 episodes ago, right?

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
We'll think of a journey back to 466, Griffin.

139
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
That was the food train.

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay, I remember food train.

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,560
Okay.

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,040
Okay.

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,760
We're good, we're good.

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,400
So 466.

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
Food train was smart actually.

146
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Food train was a smart, good idea.

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,480
But let's go to 439.

148
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,000
439, I bet you know it's a completely different

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
three boys hosted that show.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
Okay, 439.

151
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:41,840
Yeah.

152
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Well that was, that was candle lights 2018.

153
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
So you definitely do remember that.

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
The memories are there, the memories.

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
So then you probably stand with your arm like,

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
oh, but this year's number blah, blah, blah.

157
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Which is an excuse for us not to do our usual jokes.

158
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
437 to take it back to before that.

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
A silent chug.

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
Huh.

161
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,200
That's business paintball, wishbone brutality,

162
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,800
big candies.

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Oh.

164
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
The fast food arms race, serious Zapdos,

165
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
and horny radio Disney.

166
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
Horny radio Disney, I remember.

167
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
Okay, I got, I got, I got, I locked that in.

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
Is this fun for anybody other than us?

169
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Probably not.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
It's barely fun for me.

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,760
Yeah.

172
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,880
I work for a food delivery service.

173
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,760
Congratulations.

174
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,320
We can all agree this is a classic start.

175
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah.

176
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,600
You know what I mean?

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
This is right down the hump.

178
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
And I tried to follow it up to you by doing the thing

179
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,680
where I pretend like,

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
even though I know Justin's reading the question,

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
like it's that Justin is saying that thing about himself.

182
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah.

183
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
Classic, that's classic.

184
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
Classic, classic.

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm gonna miss these bits in the new era.

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,040
Yeah, right?

187
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,480
Of five, in the light of 500 when things change so dramatically

188
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,960
that it's scarcely recognizable as a podcast.

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
That's when I'm gonna stop phoning it in.

190
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
500 is our goop.

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
This is what I'm saying.

192
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
What, really?

193
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,760
Listen, I wanna get back to this question for sure,

194
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

195
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,040
Although I bet that when I started with,

197
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
I work for a food delivery service,

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,200
there were probably at least 75 people listening.

199
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,960
They're like, yes, they did mine.

200
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
All right, here we go.

201
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,320
I thought you were gonna say 75% and I was going to agree.

202
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
That number might also be accurate.

203
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,920
I would, yeah, anyway, 500 is our goop.

204
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,400
And what I'm saying is we're gonna transition

205
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
from pure comedy to more lifestyle brand.

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
I like that.

207
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
That's where the money is, is a lifestyle brand.

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,780
Yep.

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
And then we can, I've got my new bit called Exfoliation Station.

210
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Yes, yeah.

211
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,600
Everybody's been clamoring for me to have my own segment.

212
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,480
So I'm gonna be talking about all kinds of crystalline rubs.

213
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm gonna be talking about peels.

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm going to be talking about acids.

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,400
Abrasive, acidic, but your skin is either gonna look

216
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,840
but your skin is either gonna look great or-

217
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Be gone.

218
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
Be completely now your bones.

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
And even that, maybe we can talk about that.

220
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
Yeah, how to beautify your bones.

221
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,920
Everyone's focused on such surface level stuff.

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm talking about like what's inside that counts,

223
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,160
which is how pretty are your bones?

224
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Make those fucking sinews pop.

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
Let's talk about the deep tissue.

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
That in skin, but dazzling.

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm gonna do a new segment called What Not to Wear

228
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,280
and it's W-H-E-R-E.

229
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,040
And it's all about which vacation spots are out this season.

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
Loving that.

231
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,640
Thank you.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm gonna do a segment called Toxic People in the Trash

233
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,960
for me now and it's about relationships.

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,040
Oh man.

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,840
Are you in some way implying that that's Groven and I?

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,680
No, no, no.

237
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Not in any way.

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
You guys are bringing some incredible stuff.

239
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
Exfoliation, the vacation stuff.

240
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,400
I love it.

241
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
What not to wear, please.

242
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
Sometimes when I pick up food from a restaurant,

243
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
I ask for a drink.

244
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, wait.

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
Let's run it back to the beginning of the question.

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,400
I work for it.

247
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
Okay, but that is actually applicable to me.

248
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,040
Sometimes when I pick up food from a restaurant,

249
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,760
I ask for a drink.

250
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
About half the time, they just give me a drink.

251
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
But sometimes they ask for payment

252
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,480
and then I'm forced to pay for the drink

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
because I'm not gonna tell them I don't want it now.

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,440
That's true.

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,080
They already fucking got you right where they want you.

256
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Thirsty.

257
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,600
Brothers, how can I get a free drink from these restaurants

258
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
or decline the drink after the fact?

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
And that's from no such thing as a free drink.

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,320
You can't.

261
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
This is so fucking wild.

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
This is such a wild like fast food hacks

263
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,480
keep an empty cup from every fast food restaurant in your car

264
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
so you go in for free refills level of you asking us

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
how to fucking cheat the Burger King.

266
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
How to personally cheat and bamboozle the Burger Man.

267
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Okay, counterpoint though.

268
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,400
I get it.

269
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,840
Cause like you are thinking like,

270
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
oh, long day, huh?

271
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,920
We're both in the food service industry.

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,560
Woo.

273
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,800
Yeah.

274
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
Just picking up another order for those bags of bones

275
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
who can't come in and get it.

276
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,080
Am I right?

277
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,000
Anyways, I'd love a Mr. Pibbs.

278
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
But if that's the sort of spectrum we're going off of,

279
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
when I worked at TCBY,

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,280
I never walked into the Baskin Robbins down the street

281
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,680
and said like, oof, ice cream days.

282
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,720
Tell me about it.

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
These hot times.

284
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
Oh, when the hot times are here,

285
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,680
ice cream days get rough, right fam?

286
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
Anyways, Sprite for free please.

287
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
But what have you had and it worked?

288
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
That's what I'm saying is this question asker,

289
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
there's already some proven proof in the pudding here

290
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,280
that they have received free drink.

291
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,600
They're not asking, can I go do this?

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Half the time this works, right?

293
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
So here's what I would do.

294
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
Here's what I would do.

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
When the person, when you're like,

296
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
oh, can I grab a drink while I'm here?

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
And they're like, yeah, for money.

298
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
You say, oh, no moneys.

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
And pull your pockets out and they're empty.

300
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
And if you can, have a moth in there.

301
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Moth in there, that's good.

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
That will sell them like, oh, no moneys.

303
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
And then you might still get the free drink,

304
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
but at the very least it's like,

305
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,640
I delivered for let's say a sandwich chain

306
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,080
known for their rapid deliveries.

307
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,920
And a lot of the times people would tip me cash

308
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
and I was so thankful because I needed that money

309
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,840
to put gasoline into my car to get back to the sandwich chain

310
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,480
that I worked at.

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
And so it's not that far off if someone was like,

312
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,960
it's gonna be 2.99 for this large soda or whatever.

313
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,320
And I was like, no moneys.

314
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm probably not lying at that point in my life.

315
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,800
And you did have that trained moth

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,040
that you used for this exact scenario.

317
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
Well, the moth would wet its beak too.

318
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,360
You know what I mean?

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
It would get a little Mr. Pippen there as well.

320
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Here's what I would try.

321
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,080
Hey, I'm really, hey, I hate to bother you.

322
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,640
Thanks for the food.

323
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm really, really thirsty.

324
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
Do you mind if I get a drink?

325
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
And they're like, that'll be a dollar.

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
And you look at them dead in the eye and say,

327
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,720
I just meant from the sink in the bathroom.

328
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
I was just gonna get one.

329
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,960
I was gonna make my hands into a cup

330
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,200
and then drink from the sink in your bathroom.

331
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
I was just gonna lap up that muddy, dirty puddle outside.

332
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,520
Sorry.

333
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
Wow, I didn't know.

334
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,520
I just meant the puddle water and then they'll feel so bad

335
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
that they'll maybe just comp you.

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,880
Okay, just don't do that on my way.

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,400
Have a cold, refreshing nickels worth of syrup and cardboard

338
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
and enjoy this soda.

339
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
Ooh, what about this undercutting?

340
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Okay, that'll be a buck 50.

341
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
You're like, okay, how about this?

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,920
How about I give you a dollar

343
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
and we both shut the fuck up about it?

344
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
That's like a discount.

345
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay, you're right.

346
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,400
Right, that's even worse now that I'm saying it out loud maybe.

347
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,240
Yeah, higher chance of getting fired.

348
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
That's kind of Sprite embezzlement

349
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,640
if you think about it.

350
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,960
You could just turn around and resell it to another customer.

351
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,400
Be like, oh shit, really?

352
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
Okay, hold on, wait.

353
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
Anybody want a Sprite?

354
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,040
Normal price.

355
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,400
I did taste it.

356
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
So you know it's good.

357
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
Why did I just say like,

358
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
oh, I was hoping for an employee discount

359
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
and they're like, what?

360
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm like, I deliver food for you.

361
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
I'm an employee.

362
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
And then if they're like, no, you're not.

363
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,600
I was like, okay.

364
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
And then you take the food and you deliver it somewhere else

365
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,520
and you never talk to that person again.

366
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,880
Yeah, sorry, I got confused.

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,880
I thought I worked here

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
because I'm here picking up food that I'm not going to eat

369
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
and I'm taking it to someone else who is going to eat it

370
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
and they pay me.

371
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
I am here more often than you are.

372
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,920
Do you know who I am?

373
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you know who the fuck I am?

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,200
Do you know who the fuck I am?

375
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,040
They say, you have to pay for your drink.

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Just take the bag of food and up into the floor.

377
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,120
I quit.

378
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
Take this job and shove your job.

379
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,760
Please don't call my boss, which I think is you.

380
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
Or the app.

381
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
Can you call an app?

382
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,760
It would be, if they say, try to charge you,

383
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,120
just pull a sandwich bag out of your pocket

384
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,520
and say, I don't actually need a cup.

385
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,040
I don't know if you have a cheaper rate

386
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,000
if you just fill up this soda bag for me

387
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
and then I'll be on my way.

388
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
Put a soda bag.

389
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,760
Just fill up this soda bag.

390
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
I have a Yahoo here.

391
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,960
This one was sent in by Daisy.

392
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,600
Thank you, Daisy.

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,760
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Anthony J.

394
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,800
Who asks, you know such flavors?

395
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
Huh?

396
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,760
You know such flavors as chocolate cake

397
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,200
and marble vanilla, strawberry, lemon and such.

398
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,160
Right?

399
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,640
Yeah.

400
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,080
Like cake flavors.

401
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,560
Cake flavor.

402
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,760
I know such flavors.

403
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

404
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Would anybody be interested in a grape flavored cake?

405
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,040
And I, boys, the last thing I want to do

406
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
is relitigate hot grapes, right?

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
That is the last sort of predicament I want to get into.

408
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,640
Griffin, can I say something?

409
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah.

410
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
Didn't cross my mind till you said it.

411
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,040
Okay.

412
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,520
Well, maybe my bit recall is actually better

413
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,120
than I'm giving myself credit for.

414
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
But let's talk about this.

415
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,200
Where's the grapes cakes?

416
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,080
Well, here's the thing, Ditto.

417
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah.

418
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,960
Is that there's two different grape flavors,

419
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,280
as is true with a lot of fruit flavors, I would say.

420
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,080
We have the grapes that one might eat off a vine

421
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
and then we have the grape flavor that one might get

422
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,200
and say a pouch of Big League Chew, right?

423
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,720
That doesn't taste like that.

424
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
They don't taste like each other.

425
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
It's purple.

426
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,600
It's purple.

427
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,400
It's a different flavor.

428
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,960
It's purple.

429
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,600
It's purple flavor.

430
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah, but if you taste that weird Big League Chew grape,

431
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
you're like, that's grape.

432
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,080
I know what this tastes like.

433
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
And you'll eat a grape and you'll be like,

434
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,880
this tastes like grapes, right?

435
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
But the twang do not meet.

436
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
There's really not a good middle ground

437
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
of both grapes, is there?

438
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,920
No.

439
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
And if you made a flavor that tasted like grape grapes,

440
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
it would be weird as fuck.

441
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
It would be really good though, right?

442
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,320
It would be good.

443
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
Grapes is good though, actually.

444
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Travis, I'm coming back around.

445
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
I'm not saying it would be bad.

446
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Didn't say it'd be bad.

447
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,320
Said it'd be weird.

448
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,640
But they're not making cakes of this stuff.

449
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,200
Yeah.

450
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,000
They're making cakes of virtually every other flavor, right?

451
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
I've had so many, I've had more lemon cakes

452
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,280
than you could shake a freaking stick at.

453
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't know.

454
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
I could shake a stick at a lot of cakes.

455
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,920
And I've seen a lot of shows where they make,

456
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
they're making stuff like this.

457
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560
Oh yeah.

458
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
They make weird shit.

459
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,080
I watched it.

460
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
I've seen it on the Nailed It,

461
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,200
on the Great British Bake Off,

462
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
on the Zumbos.

463
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,680
Where's my Grape British Break Off?

464
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,120
My Grape British Break Off.

465
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
Let me, fuck.

466
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
My Grape British Bake Off.

467
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,720
Where is it?

468
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
I want to take a second.

469
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,520
I went ahead and Googled it.

470
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
Grape cake, right?

471
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,320
I Googled grape cake.

472
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,040
And the first result is a Food Network offering

473
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,320
from chopped judge Alex Guarnaschelli.

474
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,640
Yeah.

475
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
And here's what she has called this.

476
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
It is warm grape cake.

477
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,160
Okay.

478
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
And Alex, that's, don't tell me the temperature

479
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,040
at which this cake will arrive to my guests.

480
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,440
Because I would say you probably have a,

481
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
at best, 10 minute window of warm, right?

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,400
Before you hurdle past out of hot into cold.

483
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
Now it just challenges us.

484
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Why does she say, Alex knows this.

485
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
She's a foodie.

486
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
Why would she call it warm grape cake?

487
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
And I think it's because Alex,

488
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,920
Alex read the words grape cake

489
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
at the top of her paper guitar band

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,880
and thought, that looks fucking crazy.

491
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
I can't call it grape cake.

492
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,000
That's insane.

493
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Absolutely can't do that.

494
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
It's also entirely possible that Alex included,

495
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,040
well, at some point in the recipe.

496
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,520
So at some point you're going to have to cook these grapes.

497
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
And then she was like, I got to warn people

498
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
about what they're getting into before.

499
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
This is a sin against God.

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,320
I got to give them a heads up

501
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
before they start mixing flour and what have you.

502
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
Yeah, okay.

503
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,520
Here's what I think it is, boys.

504
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
Here's what I think it is.

505
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
Wait, wait, hold on.

506
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
I want to say something else.

507
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
The second recipe is from Once Upon a Chef

508
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
and it is called Harvest Grape Cake.

509
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,000
Fuck off.

510
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
They need something in there, huh?

511
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
Just, you got to get something in there

512
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,320
because it's just, okay.

513
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
Martha Stewart is the third result

514
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
and hers is called a Winemaker's Grape Cake.

515
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,560
Just have some strength in your-

516
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,640
Let it stand on its own merits.

517
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay, to be fair, Justin, right?

518
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,160
Someone walks up to you

519
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,320
and they're somehow balancing three trays, right?

520
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
And they say, this is a chocolate cake.

521
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,800
And you think, ah, I know what that is.

522
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
This is a strawberry cake.

523
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, yes, I understand.

524
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
And this is a grape cake.

525
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
It's the next result after that is from Kitchen

526
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,800
and it's called Fresh Grape Cake.

527
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Just, I'm having to go to the second page of Google now

528
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,560
to see if there's somebody who had the power

529
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,120
to just stand in their fucking truth.

530
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay, fine dining lovers, soft white grape cake.

531
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,040
So the cake is soft and white.

532
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,400
It's weird how not every other fucking cake recipe

533
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
has to say it's soft.

534
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah, that's not a thing.

535
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
Hey, how was the cake?

536
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,320
Soft, warm, harvest, winemakers.

537
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,720
Rock Recipes has a sunken grape almond cake.

538
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,200
Oh boy.

539
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
Come on, that sounds bad.

540
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
That sounds haunted.

541
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,720
Here's, okay, picture this, right?

542
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
The cakes I described earlier.

543
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
I hand you a strawberry cake, you cut into it.

544
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,040
What color is it?

545
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,840
Pink.

546
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay, I hand you a lemon cake, you cut into it.

547
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
What color is it?

548
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
Yellow.

549
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
I hand you a grape cake, you cut into it.

550
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
Is it purple?

551
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
But grapes aren't necessarily, oh shit, Trav.

552
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah, you better be prepared to stand next to your cake

554
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
for each person that comes up and they're like,

555
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
what's this?

556
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,560
And you have to tell them, it's a grape cake.

557
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,280
I know it's not purple, but it's not a purple cake.

558
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
It's not purple flavored.

559
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
It's not purple, it's great.

560
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
This is a grape cake.

561
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah, but shouldn't the bread be purple?

562
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
No, grapes don't dye things purple.

563
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
Like, cut open a grape, rub it on something.

564
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
It doesn't make it purple.

565
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,080
It's kind of clear on the inside, isn't it, Paul?

566
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,580
Yeah.

567
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,020
Coming over here talking smart about my grape cake.

568
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,500
I don't think this flavor's gonna be good in your cake.

569
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,660
Well, Paul Hollywood, have you ever had a fucking grape cake?

570
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,300
No, actually, why are we making cakes out of these little guys?

571
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,800
You win.

572
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,900
These little nature's gushers.

573
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,940
I love these things.

574
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,820
I love these guys.

575
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,860
I eat them all the time.

576
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,140
You're right.

577
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,780
I've never even made a cake with these guys.

578
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,980
And I make lots of cakes.

579
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,980
This is weird.

580
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,780
But then imagine Paul Hollywood gets on TV and they're like,

581
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,060
so Paul, what do you make you for us?

582
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,500
And he has to say, grape cake.

583
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,060
Paul's grape cake.

584
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,340
So it's just grape cake, Paul?

585
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:54,820
I mean, it's a Paul's fresh harvest cake featuring also grapes.

586
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,380
I bet that there was in history at least once that someone said

587
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,780
grape cake and they said, did you say great cake?

588
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,420
I hope so.

589
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,620
I was like, no, grape cake?

590
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,260
Oh, thank you.

591
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,300
I just bought it at the cape store.

592
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,980
No, I didn't say great cape.

593
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,220
What?

594
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,740
Just call it Paul's grape cake.

595
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,580
Just call it Paul's finest grape cake on the market today.

596
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,660
I work at a hardware store, specifically in the paint department.

597
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,620
I worked here for four years and I am a seasoned veteran.

598
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,860
So I know my way around the color spectrum.

599
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,060
I can make over 30,000 different colors.

600
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,560
Jesus.

601
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,780
Yeah, I mean, come on.

602
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,460
How many colors do you two think you can make?

603
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,940
How many can I make or how many can I name?

604
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,660
Wait, can I finish?

605
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,860
Yeah, can I finish?

606
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,420
Can I finish?

607
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,740
Right.

608
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,300
Who is that?

609
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,780
Who is that?

610
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,140
Is that fucking Ross Perot?

611
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,500
That is funny.

612
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,620
Fuck, that's funny.

613
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,660
Fuck, that's funny.

614
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,820
But today a customer asked me a question I've never heard before.

615
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,900
Which color is best?

616
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,380
Well, brothers, what is the best color?

617
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,860
And that's Trent from, okay, Cupid, Oklahoma City.

618
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,340
Yeah.

619
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,980
Okay.

620
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,660
Did you get, oh, you got a little confused.

621
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,460
It's okay say.

622
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:07,700
Yeah.

623
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,340
It's okay say.

624
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,140
Oh, I know, I know.

625
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,060
Yeah, your brain got scared and confused of the truth.

626
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,920
Blue.

627
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,520
Blue?

628
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,420
No, blue is a sad color.

629
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:18,920
Green.

630
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,320
Okay.

631
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,540
If we sit here and talk about our favorite colors.

632
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,500
Not our favorite best.

633
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,140
Okay, but I'm talking about what we're currently doing,

634
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,900
which is talking about our favorite colors.

635
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,340
It's not going to be fun or entertaining.

636
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,140
The bias has already, like we've been at this for 0.0 seconds

637
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,580
and the bias has already fucking crept in and polluted the game.

638
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,660
So let's take a step back and we'll take blue and green off the table for a minute

639
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,900
until we can talk about it like scientists and adults.

640
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,460
Okay, I will be a scientist then and I'll tell you.

641
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,420
The answer is, unfortunately, in the context with which I imagine this question is being asked,

642
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,980
which is like paint for either the inside or outside of a home or office or business of some sort.

643
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,180
The answer is like eggshell or off-white or something, right?

644
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,680
Yeah.

645
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,620
Because then it's like, hey, we're not going to make a choice with this color,

646
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,140
but it's not going to be white either.

647
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Oh, we're not going with white.

648
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,500
This is going to have a little life to it.

649
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,460
Well, you are, right?

650
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,700
You are though, right?

651
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,260
What do you mean?

652
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,780
You're saying, I just wanted to clarify that you're saying white's the best color.

653
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm not saying white, I'm saying off-white or eggshell.

654
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,900
So, yeah, but those are white.

655
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:35,140
So you're saying like the best Travis McElroy podcast says white is best.

656
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,940
I said in the context of paint for a room inside or outside.

657
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,700
I don't have room for that in my tweet.

658
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,940
Listen, I love all this stuff.

659
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,140
I think that's really going to help with the TMZ article and everything.

660
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,740
But what about pale gray?

661
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,300
How's that?

662
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,580
We're getting close.

663
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,620
All right, I'm going to take it in a different direction.

664
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,780
With red, you can scare a bull.

665
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,220
Yeah, but-

666
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,540
But a bull's charging.

667
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,500
Okay, Travis, let's play in the fucking space for like a minute, scientifically, okay?

668
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,820
Let's hypothesize in the space.

669
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,740
Bull is charging at you.

670
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,300
What color do you want your little handy towel to be?

671
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,100
I mean, red, but I don't think the customer's asking, what color should I paint?

672
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,780
I'm asking, what color should I buy to paint my handy towel, Griffin?

673
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,860
The color, Griffin has said the bull is scared of red.

674
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,500
So is the way the bull fighting works is the scene is red and the bull has to be like,

675
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,860
that's really fucking scary, but I'm not going to be cowed by this.

676
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,100
I want to show that he's the boss, even though I'm fucking terrified of this town.

677
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,740
No, yeah.

678
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,220
You know, red was the color that every bull's gym coach wore is the thing.

679
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,980
And so the bull's like, I will not be bullied, that's where the term comes from,

680
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,260
by the color red again.

681
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,020
Yeah, so I'm trying to think of like practicality, right?

682
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,580
Yes, I think, what about this?

683
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,380
Camouflage.

684
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,660
That's a few colors though, isn't it, Travis?

685
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,060
Well, you say that, but I see those videos on Facebook where people like dip a helmet.

686
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,820
They don't dick a helmet, that'd be weird.

687
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,500
They dip a helmet into water that has that camouflage paint sitting on top of it.

688
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,660
Those are, dude, and those videos are badass, like we can all agree on that,

689
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,020
but it's so far from being a-

690
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,860
The way they, that and the ones where people dig out like a pool in a house and stuff.

691
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,540
And they just like live there?

692
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,620
Whoa, I can watch that with the sound off for days.

693
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,940
What about the ones where they make cakes, but they're like clear jello cakes?

694
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,500
Oh yes, the ones where they slowly make stuff out of like colored pencils and,

695
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,900
you know, it's like, oh look, I'm going to recreate like a thing to sharpen pencils

696
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,820
and I'm going to do it in like a thousand steps.

697
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,500
I fucking love that, dude.

698
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,180
That's a good color.

699
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,900
I think so far, if we're doing it with an unbiased stance,

700
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,340
my Red Scares the Bull argument is still sort of in the lead because it's the one,

701
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,900
it's the only color you're going to want if a bull's coming to get you.

702
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,180
Okay, okay.

703
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,700
So unless anybody has something that can beat the Red Scares the Bull.

704
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,900
The Red Scares the Bull.

705
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,740
What's a color that bees don't like?

706
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,500
I was just thinking about bees, Travis.

707
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,940
Yeah, you were thinking about bees?

708
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,660
But I don't think they give a fuck about color, do they?

709
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,900
Well, what if you painted your whole house to look like a big bee?

710
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,340
That's multiple colors.

711
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,140
I don't think if you paint-

712
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,260
It's two colors, it's two.

713
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,900
Yeah.

714
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,220
Do you know that bees can see colors we can't?

715
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,860
Yeah.

716
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,220
Oh, so it's probably, the answer is probably whatever color that bee is seeing.

717
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,420
Bees can see UV fucking tripping 24 hours a day.

718
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,060
That makes me mad that there's a color I can't see.

719
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,780
Okay, thank you.

720
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm glad they're gone.

721
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,820
Well, when you look at the color spectrum, right?

722
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,780
And let's put it on here.

723
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,820
Let's do, sometimes boys, I like to be a little bit nerdy.

724
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,060
And I like to really geek it up.

725
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:08,100
It's like just past like indigo, purple, ultraviolet, right?

726
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,900
So like, I just imagine it keeps going and then it's like ultra ultraviolet.

727
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,260
It gets purpler and purpler and purpler.

728
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,460
So like bees, they see all the cool colors that we can see,

729
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,060
but they can see the dankest fucking purples that are so purple,

730
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,100
like our brains can't even think about it.

731
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,100
And what if, hey, you guys, what if one day all the bees looked up

732
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,540
and God had written in like ultraviolet in the middle of the air,

733
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,340
everything's fucked, you guys need to get out of here.

734
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,460
But we couldn't see it and the bees did.

735
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,980
And they're like, oh, we better go.

736
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,420
Can I talk more about bees for one second?

737
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,700
Yeah, I'd love that.

738
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,780
Bees cannot distinguish red from black.

739
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,660
So I think if bees could talk, the first thing bees would say is,

740
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,020
you have got to explain checkers to me.

741
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,700
What the fuck are you guys doing?

742
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,260
Come on, you're just moving these tiny plates?

743
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,980
I don't know, y'all, but it is wild.

744
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,780
That's why we left, because y'all are doing checkers so much.

745
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,940
We're like, this is fucking nothing.

746
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,740
Okay, so just to clarify, bees can see colors that we can't,

747
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,940
but they also can't see colors that we can?

748
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,820
Yeah, baby, it's a trade-off.

749
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,780
I hate that.

750
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,620
That's why we're so different, huh?

751
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,940
It takes all kinds, it takes a whole village to pollinate a flower.

752
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,580
Everyone should have a bee paired with them.

753
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,700
The bee will tell us about all the ultraviolet stuff we can't see.

754
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,940
And we can be like, hey, let me explain to you

755
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,140
why this can of Mountain Dew Red looks so cool.

756
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,260
I'm gonna make a point about bees, all right?

757
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,220
Everybody's pretty upset.

758
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,780
Everybody stand back.

759
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,900
So many of them.

760
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Let's just, real quick, it's red, it scares the bull away.

761
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,460
And now let's go, now we can go on-

762
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,260
It's red, it's settled.

763
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,760
Yeah.

764
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,620
Everybody's complaining about the bees leaving, and they're upset about it.

765
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:01,860
Yeah.

766
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,660
And I get it, right?

767
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,420
And it's because bees pollinate flower, right?

768
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah, bees pollinate flower.

769
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,460
Here's what I would say, if bees cared about us,

770
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,100
they would probably just tell us how to do it, right?

771
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,820
How to pollinate a flower?

772
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,540
If the bees would tell us how to do the pollinating, we could do it.

773
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,900
And then they could leave.

774
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,740
They could have told us before they left,

775
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,100
here's the secret, you give it a special little billy tickle,

776
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,060
and then you slip the pollen.

777
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,340
I'm guessing, I don't know.

778
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,940
Well, the answer would probably be like,

779
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,900
well, you rub your bits on it, and then you take your bits,

780
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,140
and you rub it over here on this other flower.

781
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,660
There's a lot of bit dipping.

782
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,140
They've been-

783
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,700
They could have just taught ants, right?

784
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,980
What are ants doing?

785
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,780
Well, they're not flying, Justin.

786
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,740
Listen up, ants.

787
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,300
First things first, you gotta get out of the ground.

788
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,500
Sucks to live down there.

789
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,140
What are you doing?

790
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,340
It's dirty as hell.

791
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,700
Second, I want to talk about having a wank in the garden,

792
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,860
because that's how we do things around here.

793
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,060
You're bees now, ants.

794
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,020
I'm just saying bees could be ants.

795
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,340
Well, yeah, obviously, obviously.

796
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,500
But without wings, and the bees like,

797
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,540
you gotta get up there,

798
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,700
and you gotta rub your bits on that flower.

799
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,380
Every time the ant gets up there, it's like,

800
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,300
all right, let's do this.

801
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,100
And it's gotta like climb up the flower stem,

802
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,300
and then it gets up there, and it's like,

803
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,500
well, I don't want to rub my bits on there.

804
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,380
Or maybe it gets up there,

805
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,860
and somebody's already rubbing their bits on the flower.

806
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,500
And it's, I mean, also, ants are just so strong-juiced,

807
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
so when they get up there and they try to crank off,

808
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,900
they're gonna rip their members, dude.

809
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,580
Yeah, dude, that's actually true.

810
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,060
Yeah, dude.

811
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,460
Hey, let's take a break.

812
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,100
Rip them right up.

813
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,340
Punch a hole right through their thorax, dude.

814
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,660
These ants aren't gonna be cranking.

815
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:56,820
Uh, yeah, so we forgot to record the freaking ads, man.

816
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,900
And I don't have an excuse for it.

817
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,660
If you're looking for excuses,

818
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,420
go somewhere the hell else,

819
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,660
um, because we just forgot.

820
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,380
Uh, we recorded like a bunch of my bim-bams.

821
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,820
This, no, you know what?

822
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,060
This, this ain't over the plate, is it?

823
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,500
This one's pretty far off the plate.

824
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,620
So, uh, I'm just gonna do the ads real quick,

825
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,460
and we'll pretend like this never happened.

826
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,260
I mean, pretend like you heard the ads and act on them,

827
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,660
because that makes us look, like, really good.

828
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,980
But anyway, our first sponsor is Away.

829
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,020
Away makes very good suitcases.

830
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,700
We have an Away suitcase,

831
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,340
and I recently purchased a second matching Away suitcase,

832
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,620
because I like it a lot.

833
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,540
It's got lots of dope pockets.

834
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,460
It's got these four 360-degree spinner wheels

835
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,220
and a TSA-approved combination lock,

836
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,420
so don't even worry about that.

837
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,900
Uh, and also there's a 100-day trial on everything Away makes

We are also sponsored by Warby Parker.

851
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,900
Warby Parker, I know, scary name, right?

852
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,660
It's got war right in there,

853
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,260
but you don't need to be scared because it also has park in there.

854
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,780
And parks are great.

855
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,300
They have grass and birds and trees and stuff.

856
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,020
Warby Parker doesn't deal in grass and trees,

857
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,780
they deal in glasses.

858
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,620

868

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,300
and those lenses have anti-glare and anti-scratch coatings.

880
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,180
It's good stuff.

881
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,580
warbyparker.com slash my brother.

882
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,660
Hi, I am Lori Kilmartin.

883
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,940
And I'm Jackie Kishan.

884
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,260
Together we host a podcast called

885
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,540
The Jackie and Lori Show.

886
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,540
We're both stand up comics.

887
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,780
We recently met each other

888
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,540
because women weren't allowed to work together

889
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,660
on the road or in gigs for a long, long time.

890
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,700
And so our friendship has been unfolding on this podcast

891
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,500
for a couple of years.

892
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,340
Jackie constantly works the road.

893
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,300
I write for Conan and then I work the road in between.

894
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,900
We do a lot of stand up comedy.

895
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,580
And so we celebrate stand up and we also bitch about it.

896
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,700
We keep it to an hour.

897
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,820
We don't have any guests.

898
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,340
We somehow find enough to talk about every single week.

899
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,060
So find us.

900
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,580
You can subscribe to The Jackie and Lori Show at maximumfun.org

901

902
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:32,420
Okay, bye.

903
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,900
I want a munch squad.

904
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,060
I want two munch squads.

905
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,020
I'm standing up.

906
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,260
Whoa.

907
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,620
Right down the middle.

908
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,820
This is one that's usually here.

909
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,860
And now it's here again.

910
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,700
Munch squad.

911
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,900
This is a little late.

912
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,260
So we may have missed this promotion, folks.

913
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,300
But I'm sure plenty of you took advantage of it.

914
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,780
Boston Market selling baby back rib bouquets for $29.99.

915
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,660
Holy shit.

916
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,460
Yeah, I think we missed it.

917
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,260
I don't think they're gonna do it on Easter.

918
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,020
Show that.

919
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,860
No, then they just sell crucifixes.

920
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,980
It's two ribs.

921
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,860
It's two.

922
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,380
And a crucifix.

923
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,940
Same price.

924
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,700
The same price.

925
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,740
Still $30.

926
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,020
It's all about the experience.

927
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,820
It's experiential eating at Boston Market.

928
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Hey, we're kind of taking kind of an avant garde approach

929
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,340
to what it means to be Boston Market.

930
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,860
Boston Market is bidding farewell to flowers

931
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,180
and chow to chocolates this Valentine's Day

932
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,060
with a new one of a kind gift.

933
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,980
A romantic bouquet made of its newest menu offering.

934
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,020
Fall off the bone, baby back ribs.

935
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,980
That term has never sounded good to me.

936
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,940
I need it to be on the bone at least

937
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,260
until it reaches the mouth quadrant.

938
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,820
Well, sir, and certainly if your plan is to deliver

939
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,900
a bouquet of them to your lovers,

940
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,500
you wouldn't want them to stick to your ribs, right?

941
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,540
To your ribs, ribs.

942
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,180
With a pile of meat on the floor and a bunch of bones.

943
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,740
Hey, this Valentine's Day, how about a dozen

944
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,500
fall off the stem roses?

945
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,060
Right, it's beautifully assembled with one dozen

946
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,180
tender Boston Market baby back ribs.

947
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,820
The limited edition and sure to be coveted.

948
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,180
Fucking pull up an imaginary store

949
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,340
and then get a seatbelt on your imaginary stool

950
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,420
and strap yourself into it,

951
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,500
because this is about to blast you right out of the water.

952
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,140
Are you ready for this?

953
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,180
The sure to be coveted bay B-A-E

954
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,380
be back ribs bouquet.

955
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,900
The bay be back ribs bouquet will be available

956
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,100
for purchase on Friday, February 14th

957
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,380
in all Boston Market restaurants nationwide

958
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,580
while supplies last for $29.99.

959
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,140
Hey, fuck, it's one day.

960
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,220
So there are people, other humans,

961
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,540
you know, like us people on earth,

962
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,780
that had to spend their life minutes

963
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,060
learning how to make a tasteful rib bouquet

964
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,860
for this fucking punchline of a promotion

965
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,300
that lasts one day.

966
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,060
Hey, Justin, can I just dip in real quick

967
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,740
for a second to touch on that thought?

968
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,660
Because when you say beautifully arranged,

969
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,460
tastefully arranged,

970
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,060
the idea to execution gap that exists there for me

971
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,820
is insurmountable.

972
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,580
I'm going to take these dozen bones

973
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,060
with meat and drippings on them

974
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,140
and arrange them so that a human being

975
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,220
would look upon them with their eye jellies

976
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,980
and say, beautiful.

977
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,380
Well done, well arranged.

978
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,700
These have certainly been touched

979
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,460
more than the usual ribs.

980
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm crazy about them.

981
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,540
And even more so that then another human being

982
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,140
with their eye jellies would look

983
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,460
at the new human being holding this

984
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,860
and say, I wish I had that.

985
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,900
And imagine the light in your lover's eyes

986
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,060
and the shame in yours when you admit to them

987
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,380
it costs $30 for this fucking punchline.

988
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,860
When we first toyed with the idea

989
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,020
of adding baby back ribs to our menu.

990
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,100
Wait, wait, wait, they don't even normally

991
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,620
do baby back ribs?

992
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,540
It's a newer offering.

993
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,300
When we first toyed with the idea of adding-

994
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,060
I love the phrase, toyed with the idea,

995
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,340
like, how playful.

996
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,380
Hey, guys, wouldn't it?

997
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,540
I just want to put the tiger on the table

998
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,300
and fucking just yell at it.

999
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,500
Wouldn't it be so funny?

1000
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,820
Baby back ribs, so cute and sweet.

1001
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,420
Oh my God, baby back ribs to our menu.

1002
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,140
We knew we wanted to focus on flavor and quality,

1003
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,620
says Chef Tony Fialho,

1004
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,700
Director of Culinary Innovation at Boston Market.

1005
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,940
That's why we had to put them in a fucking crazy shape.

1006
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,740
Nothing says quality like pretending

1007
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,300
like baby back ribs are flowers to try to sell them.

1008
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
That's why we're slow cooking our ribs

1009
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,220
to fall off the bone perfection again

1010
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,420
before smothering them in sweet baby Ray's

1011
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,100
famous hickory barbecue sauce.

1012
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,140
We just launched baby back ribs a few weeks ago

1013
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,980
and our guests are loving them.

1014
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,300
On their own, our baby back ribs

1015
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,180
are sure to delight barbecue enthusiasts everywhere.

1016
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,340
But when packaged in a delectable bouquet,

1017
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,380
they're the picture perfect Valentine's Day gift

1018
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,260
to help anyone delight and feed that special someone.

1019
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,740
That is one of the things is you have to sit there

1020
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,460
and watch your lover consume the entire bouquet.

1021
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,380
That is part of the gift.

1022
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,380
Boston Market is also inviting guests

1023
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,420
to celebrate their bae over a shared plate

1024
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,100
of baby back ribs, making it the perfect date night spot

1025
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,860
for some Valentine's Day loving.

1026
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,740
Oh my God, wait, read that last sentence again,

1027
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,580
but slower and deeper.

1028
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,620
Boston Market is inviting guests to celebrate their bae

1029
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,420
over a shared plate of baby back ribs,

1030
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,220
making it the perfect date night spot

1031
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,700
for some Valentine's Day loving.

1032
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,260
Yes, friends, Boston Market is encouraging you

1033
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,140
to fuck in the booth.

1034
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:24,580
Come on in, eat some cornbread and fuck in the booth.

1035
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,900
You know, I'm never my most ready for sexual intercourse

1036
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,620
than after consuming a bunch of ribs and bread.

1037
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,060
In public.

1038
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,860
At a Boston Market.

1039
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,500
For $30.

1040
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:44,180
On February 14th, pork isn't the only pork at Boston Market.

1041
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,180
It's a double entendre.

1042
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,860
On February 14th, couples can enjoy a romantic dinner for two,

1043
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:57,220
featuring two half orders of ribs, two sides per person,

1044
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,540
and two pieces of cornbread for only $20,

1045
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,140
with a coupon available online at Boston Market.

1046
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,660
So you're telling me,

1047
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,860
I can get a dozen ribs plus extras plus some bonuses

1048
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,380
and then arrange them myself and saved a 10 spot

1049
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,340
is what you're telling me?

1050
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,780
Yeah, I don't know how much you're in the portion.

1051
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,820
10, half rack is like, it's gotta be more ribs for 20,

1052
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,900
but they're upcharging you, although you know what?

1053
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,580
This is the $10 question.

1054
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,740
How do you arrange these ribs?

1055
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,500
Well, that's a great question, Griffin.

1056
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,340
I'm gonna share with you an image.

1057
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,060
Oh, cool.

1058
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,900
Of what it looked like, and it is troubling.

1059
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,660
And this is a promotional image.

1060
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm sharing it in Slack now.

1061
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,220
It should be noted that this is not an image

1062
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,460
of like someone at home got this,

1063
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,380
or this is what it looked like in their perfect-

1064
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,460
I wish, I'm gonna need to tweet this one out

1065
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,620
because the way these ribs descend to the stem

1066
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,540
does not make sense.

1067
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,100
It can't possibly be anything.

1068
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,740
It also kind of looks for this promotional image.

1069
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,700
Like they took kind of like big hunks of like wet newspaper

1070
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,260
and dipped it in like mud and chocolate.

1071
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,340
Chocolate and said, delicious.

1072
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,660
This next part isn't germane to the story,

1073
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,980
but it is, they've thrown it in here.

1074
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,860
Boston Market fans can also spread the love even further

1075
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,940
when enjoying the new baby back ribs

1076
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,460
or any of their other favorites

1077
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,380
thanks to the recently launched Rotisserie Rewards program.

1078
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,860
The loyalty program available via the new Boston Market

1079
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,260
mobile app for iOS and Android online at bostonmarket.com

1080
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:46,900
or inRestaurant.

1081
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,100
Are you doing that intentionally?

1082
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,700
What?

1083
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,260
The ellenbarkinrestaurant.com.

1084
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,860
Bostonmarket.com or inRestaurant

1085
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,580
allows customers to earn one point for every dollar

1086
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,980
they spend in restaurant or online.

1087
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:09,540
Can you guys imagine what it would be like

1088
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,260
to order your food at Boston Market

1089
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,660
and then say, hold on a second.

1090
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,140
I'm a member of the Rotisserie Rewards program

1091
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,940
and I want to make sure I'm credited the points

1092
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,180
for these ribs I'm buying.

1093
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,260
I'm not eating these ribs for my enjoyment.

1094
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,540
This is work to me.

1095
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,100
I need these points.

1096
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,620
You probably recognize me.

1097
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm part of the club.

1098
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,300
So anyway, Boston Market is making a truly delectable

1099
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,420
Valentine's Day mistake.

1100
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,460
I'm sorry we missed it.

1101
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,740
I'm sorry we couldn't get out there

1102
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,620
and warn people about it ahead of time.

1103
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,940
But here's a quick Yahoo.

1104
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,460
And this one was sent in by Toasty Feet.

1105
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,180
Thanks, Toasty Feet.

1106
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,780
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1107
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,020
I'm going to call him Blaze asks,

1108
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,420
corn with a K, future Super Bowl halftime show?

1109
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,260
Oh boy.

1110
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Will corn, with a K, ever be selected to do a Super Bowl halftime show?

1111
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,620
And then first response here three days ago,

1112
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,060
Conley 39 says, it's possible, but unlikely.

1113
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,380
Well, that's true of anyone being announced.

1114
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,220
They could say we're doing a live my brother,

1115
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,460
my brother and me for the, it's possible?

1116
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,340
I just side note, I'd rather see corn.

1117
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,700
Yeah, no fucking kidding, man.

1118
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,020
Corn, corn rips ass, dude.

1119
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,500
Okay, here's where it was at, here's where it was at.

1120
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,820
If corn did the halftime show, here's how it would go.

1121
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,540
The first two or three minutes,

1122
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,420
you'd be laughing your fucking brains.

1123
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,740
It would be so fucking hysterical

1124
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,220
that corn was doing the halftime show.

1125
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,100
And then like five to seven minutes in,

1126
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:57,460
they'd probably do like a really obscure cover of some cool song.

1127
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,940
And I think, I feel like by the middle of it,

1128
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,100
you'd be like, hey, this kind of rips ass, hey, weird.

1129
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,540
Maybe I fucking love this.

1130
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
Actually, this kind of fucking rules,

1131
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,380
like this kind of rips ass, doesn't it?

1132
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,700
Wait, did we all forget that maybe Freak on a Leash

1133
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,220
wasn't like a bad song?

1134
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,140
Like this, it's kind of fun with your friends

1135
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,700
when you're all palling around and having a few laughs

1136
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,980
to be like, but when he does it in the context of this song,

1137
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,900
it actually kind of beats ass.

1138
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,660
Okay, this is a real Yahoo for adults.

1139
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,620
Grace sent it in.

1140
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,700
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user, I'm gonna call JJ, asks,

1141
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,220
what would happen if I trolled a poker game in Las Vegas?

1142
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,340
Say that I'm in a Las Vegas strip casino

1143
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,780
and I go to the bar on the casino floor

1144
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,300
and order the largest beer they have.

1145
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,460
Then I walk over to the poker room

1146
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,660
where people are playing poker

1147
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,820
and I fling the beer out of the mug at the table.

1148
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,660
Then people are playing poker one moment

1149
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,380
and all of a sudden a tsunami of beer comes splashing down

1150
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,620
all over the table, the cards, and the chips.

1151
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,580
Then I make a run for it, beelining for the nearest exit.

1152
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,420
And in some casinos, the nearest exit

1153
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,780
is not far away from the poker room, lol.

1154
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,660
What would come of that?

1155
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,180
Okay, can I just say, I love that this person

1156
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,020
asked the question, what would happen?

1157
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,180
And then describes what would happen.

1158
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,980
I throw it and then I have to run away

1159
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,820
because I assume people will be chasing me

1160
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,660
because I'd be very much in trouble.

1161
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,700
Lots of people play poker.

1162
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,940
Lots of people play poker and it's a pro sport

1163
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,100
and a lot of people are playing poker these days.

1164
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:38,180
But I feel like there's a lot of room left at the table,

1165
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,140
the gambling table where they play poker,

1166
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,020
for advanced stratagems like this one.

1167
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,220
Obviously, this is like 90% of what poker is.

1168
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,740
People will tell you it's about how you bet

1169
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,260
or how you play the card, no.

1170
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,180
It's about the showmanship.

1171
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,740
It's like, maybe you've partnered

1172
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,340
with the beer throwing person.

1173
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,100
Oh, this person's on a hot streak.

1174
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,980
I gotta ice them.

1175
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,820
I'll signal the Bobby to throw some natty light on the table.

1176
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,020
Oh, what's that?

1177
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,420
And that's, I mean, this person has obviously

1178
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,940
unlocked the door for us and ushered in a new era.

1179
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,580
And that's great.

1180
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,820
But I can think of like a hundred different ways

1181
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,900
we could just go ahead and bump it up.

1182
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,620
We can escalate it to the next level.

1183
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:27,300
So you're playing and you've got pocket rockets, baby.

1184
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,340
And the flush, the flop comes out.

1185
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,100
It's like two, two, three.

1186
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
And you're like, fuck, yeah, I got this all in.

1187
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,100
The other person's like, I'm all in.

1188
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,180
And then they flop a four of a kind.

1189
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,860
And you're stuck there with your pocket rockets

1190
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,380
like a real dipshit.

1191
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:46,180
And then the poker champ, the poker umpire, yeah.

1192
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,860
Devilfish.

1193
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,700
Well, the umpire, you're playing against Devilfish.

1194
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,060
And the poker umpire is like-

1195
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,100
I just wanna make sure he's in the mix.

1196
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,500
Yeah.

1197
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,140
Devilfish is there.

1198
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,580
And also Richard Kind is there.

1199
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,540
Richard Kind is there.

1200
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,140
He's having a fucking great, he's losing a lot.

1201
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,820
But he's having the time of his fucking life.

1202
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,860
I lose to Devilfish with my pocket rockets.

1203
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,580
And they're like, oops, oh, sorry, Griffin.

1204
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,100
You lost with your pocket rockets.

1205
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,700
I think I should be like, ah, but like I don't,

1206
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,380
but like I'm not gonna give you my chips this time.

1207
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:19,540
Yes.

1208
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,140
Because the cards I had were really good.

1209
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,380
And the cards you had were really good also.

1210
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,540
But I'm gonna hold on to my chips this time.

1211
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,820
And like, I don't think there's much you can do about it.

1212
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,660
Well, this is where the old double or nothing maneuver comes in.

1213
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,380
Oh, nice.

1214
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,180
You lose, but then you just yell, double or nothing.

1215
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,980
And no one really knows what that means.

1216
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,220
But if the person agrees and you win,

1217
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,100
then you don't have to give them anything.

1218
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,900
I think it's out.

1219
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,260
Or you get double.

1220
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,780
I'm not really sure.

1221
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,780
Can I tell you what my go-to maneuver is?

1222
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,780
My go-to, because I, you know, I play the rooms.

1223
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,420
You know what I mean?

1224
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:56,900
I'm out there.

1225
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,460
I'm on the felt.

1226
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,300
I'm kind of a felt jockey, you know?

1227
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,660
I'm playing the green felt.

1228
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,940
You'll flip the ponies.

1229
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,900
Yeah, I'll flip the ponies.

1230
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,540
You know what I mean?

1231
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,300
Like, I'll dig with the spades.

1232
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,860
You know what I mean?

1233
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,020
I'll eat the clovers.

1234
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,460
I'll break some hearts.

1235
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,900
I'll cut some diamonds.

1236
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,540
You get it.

1237
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,900
Well, these are all card terms.

1238
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,700
These are what people say.

1239
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,380
You'll put some dice in your butt.

1240
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,420
Yeah, exactly.

1241
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,780
Thank you, Griffin, right?

1242
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,100
I'm a chipper.

1243
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,500
And if I look at my cards, right?

1244
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,380
I've stuck in.

1245
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,900
I've called every bet.

1246
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,900
Then I realize I'm losing.

1247
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,580
And there's no way I could win.

1248
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,500
I pull a deck of cards out of my pocket,

1249
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,540
and I start dealing them.

1250
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,580
Oh, man.

1251
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,100
And I deal them out to everyone else, right?

1252
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,300
And now we're playing simultaneous hands of poker.

1253
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,540
And maybe they've forgotten which cards

1254
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,980
are going with which game, you know?

1255
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,740
And I can just flip flop.

1256
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,340
And that's where the term flop comes from.

1257
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,340
Exchange my cards for other cards from my other hand,

1258
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,980
and I win both hands now.

1259
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,020
There's a lot of silly stuff you could do at the table

1260
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,580
to get everything all scrambled and mixed around.

1261
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:56,820
Yeah.

1262
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,460
You know, you could also a big fan.

1263
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,660
A big fan, guys.

1264
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,300
Big fan.

1265
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,860
Like no one's even thought of a big fan yet.

1266
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,300
And you don't even need electricity.

1267
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,580
It could be like one of those like big just hand fans.

1268
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:08,740
Yeah.

1269
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,420
And you could blow the game away.

1270
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,060
Sometimes I also will just take my hand on all my chips,

1271
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,420
and I'll put them at the front of my shirt

1272
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,460
and pretend like I'm pregnant.

1273
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah.

1274
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,780
Or I'll dribble someone else's chips like behind their head.

1275
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,140
Yeah.

1276
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,820
And I'm like, oh, what's that?

1277
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,940
I've got extended arms.

1278
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,740
Do you ever palm a real chip

1279
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,620
and then raise one of the poker chips to your mouth

1280
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,780
and then secretly eat the real chip?

1281
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,180
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,300
Just be like, get it?

1283
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,940
And that's a great strategy.

1284
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,820
You could also just like when you're the short stack,

1285
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,660
you could just be like, I'm all in.

1286
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,940
And then you pick up all your chips

1287
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,580
and you throw them into another player's chip pile.

1288
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,300
And then you point and say, hey, some of those are mine

1289
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,900
and they don't know how many.

1290
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,460
Yeah.

1291
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,500
And here's the thing.

1292
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,980
If anybody gets too mad at you about any of these stunts,

1293
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,180
there's a new secret life hack

1294
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,260
I've been working on right here, okay?

1295
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,060
If anybody gets too mad at you about any of these stunts,

1296
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,340
here's a foolproof plan

1297
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,060
that'll get you out of almost any situation once.

1298
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,740
Once you look at them and you get embarrassed

1299
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,260
and you say, I'm sorry, we're filming in Xenoman 2.

1300
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,820
And then you point, see, there's the camera over there.

1301
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,220
And when they look at the camera, you run away.

1302
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,100
That would work pretty much anytime

1303
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,460
you've done something embarrassing.

1304
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,220
Because like, of course, this caveman,

1305
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,740
I mean, I've barely laid the groundwork for it.

1306
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,420
But yeah, unless, I guess, unless what?

1307
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,380
Imagine this, Justin.

1308
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,500
You do something embarrassing.

1309
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,660
You say, I'm filming in Xenoman 2.

1310
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,500
Oh no, the person you're embarrassed in front of

1311
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,540
is Brendan Fraser.

1312
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,620
And he's like, I know you're not filming in Xenoman 2

1313
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,540
because I get first look at Xenoman 2.

1314
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,580
No one showed me a script for Xenoman 2.

1315
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,700
Hey Trav, hey Trav.

1316
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,180
Or he's like, or he's deeply wounded.

1317
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,940
Wait a minute.

1318
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,820
Are you, wow, okay.

1319
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,700
Ouch, this one hurts.

1320
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,700
I guarantee he got last of my refusal on that one, right?

1321
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,060
When they tried to book him originally,

1322
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,740
they got Sean Assin, we got the weasel.

1323
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,780
And now we need to get the phrase.

1324
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,100
And he was like, I'll do it on one condition

1325
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,860
for any future Xenomans, I get right of last refusal.

1326
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,740
And last rights.

1327
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,340
I don't think poker players should get to think

1328
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,660
that they're cool as they are.

1329
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,820
I think poker players wear the upside down visors

1330
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,020
and sunglasses and they smoke big stogies.

1331
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,900
And they have cool names like Devil Fish.

1332
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,980
And they drive big, cool, loud cars.

1333
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,300
And they think they're so big and cool, right?

1334
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,260
Hey guys, you're playing board games.

1335
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,620
You're basically playing a board game.

1336
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,060
Like, you know what I mean?

1337
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,140
Yeah, but we have a whole show

1338
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,580
where we play Dungeons and Dragons.

1339
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,700
And I like to walk around with those

1340
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,180
upside down visors and sunglasses inside and stuff.

1341
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,900
I'm just saying.

1342
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,460
Pauly Shore wants to make Xenoman 2.

1343
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,620
I found this story from 2014, he's in.

1344
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,140
Okay, we got the weasel.

1345
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,220
The weasel wants to do it.

1346
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,500
It's probably so picky too.

1347
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,060
Xenoman 2, let's do it, he said.

1348
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,300
My agent and I are talking about it.

1349
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,460
Looks like the writer, Sean Sheps of the 1992 original,

1350
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,780
quote, already has an idea for the story

1351
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,980
but hasn't written it yet.

1352
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,140
So that's a roadblock.

1353
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,980
Do you think the idea for this story is

1354
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,820
there's a caveman of some sort

1355
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,580
and he's doing something in Encino?

1356
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,300
He's got kids and one of them is half caveman.

1357
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300
He's giving the kids caveman disease

1358
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,060
and he can't live with himself.

1359
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,100
I'm sorry, Justin.

1360
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,580
If you remember correctly, at the end of the movie,

1361
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,060
there's also a cave woman who appears

1362
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,260
and she and caveman appear to be happy together.

1363
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:50,580
Maybe.

1364
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,860
He's Encino man, the first of the Geico cavemen.

1365
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,260
So it sounds like we've got an idea for the story

1366
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,620
and haven't written it yet.

1367
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,180
So one might say our little small corporation

1368
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,140
also is ready to make Encino Man 2

1369
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,820
and is as close as Mr. Sheps.

1370
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,940
We've been talking about it.

1371
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,580
Can we start the episode over

1372
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,500
and just make it kind of storyboarding Encino Man 2?

1373
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Just really nailing these beats down.

1374
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,660
Now we know what episode 500 is gonna be.

1375
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,340
Sir, it's just gonna be us perfecting our pitch

1376
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,620
for Encino Man 2.

1377
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,940
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1378
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,980
my brother, my brother and me.

1379
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself

1380
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,300
and we hope that you are having a good day.

1381
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,860
I don't know if we ever say that, but I feel that.

1382
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,420
I feel that.

1383
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,700
I hope you're having a good day.

1384
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,740
I don't know when this episode is posting.

1385
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,540
So it's kind of hard for me to articulate much more than that.

1386
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,220
But gosh, I hope it's a good one.

1387
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,140
I can do big general announcements.

1388
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,780
One, tickets went on sale last week for our new live show tour.

1389
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,860
Maybe they're sold out, but if they're not,

1390
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,340
you should go to McElroy.family, click on tours,

1391
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,100
get tickets there.

1392
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,180
A bunch of shows, some stuff in Norfolk, Virginia,

1393
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,820
stuff at Foxwoods Casino.

1394
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,300
It's all there.

1395
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,740
There's a bunch of dates.

1396
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,940
Go check that out.

1397
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,740
Also, the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

1398
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,740
Three Pedals to the Metal, it's coming out in July.

1399
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,900
If you haven't pre-ordered yet, what are you waiting for?

1400
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,340
It's gonna be our best one yet.

1401
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,020
I'm not just saying that to be cute.

1402
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
It's really good, and I'm really proud of it.

1403
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,260
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

1404
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,500
and pre-order it now.

1405
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,580
That helps us a lot.

1406
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,260
Everybody's so supportive of the book.

1407
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,860
And when it comes out, people are always showing their support

1408
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,860
and showing that they got it and shared it with their friends.

1409
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,300
But the pre-order stuff really does help us out in a major way.

1410
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,060
So think about it if you haven't done it yet.

1411
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,940
And you can also, as always, go check out McElroyMerch.com

1412
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,140
to see all of our fun merchandise stuff there.

1413
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,340
It's great.

1414
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,940
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1415
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,100
for the theme song, It's a Departure,

1416
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,780
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1417
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,380
And that one's been there for us.

1418
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,340
That one's right down the fucking middle.

1419
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,100
That one's right across the plate.

1420
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,060
And we are just so appreciative.

1421
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,540
Maximum Fun is also on the play, and we love them for it.

1422
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,180
Speaking of, Max Fun Drive is coming up

1423
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,540
middle of March.

1424
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,660
We're gonna have a lot of cool-

1425
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,580
Can we say what our episode was?

1426
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,020
I feel like we should talk about it.

1427
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,820
Yeah, go for it, Griffin.

1428
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,300
You know what?

1429
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,580
I'm gonna make the call and say yes.

1430
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,300
I mean, we do crank calls.

1431
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,340
Yeah, we do crank calls.

1432
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,900
And it goes super good.

1433
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Yeah, we're really good at prank calling.

1434
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,060
It's not, you may hear that and think,

1435
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,900
but these boys wouldn't be good at that.

1436
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,180
That'll be a rough listen.

1437
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,260
It's, y'all, it's a fun time.

1438
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,300
And we can say that.

1439
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,660
We say it's crank calls.

1440
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,020
Really, we're just having fun.

1441
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,260
And you'll like it too.

1442
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,740
And you can get that if you are a donor

1443
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,540
or you can become a donor during the Max Fun Drive

1444
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,900
or you can be an upgrading donor.

1445
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,420
All those things, middle of March,

1446
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,180
we're gonna have a lot of fun bonus content,

1447
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,180
both for donors only and a lot of stuff

1448
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,980
that's just gonna come out on our YouTube

1449
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,340
and in our thread.

1450
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,380
And yeah, it's gonna be great.

1451
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,500
We're gonna have a great time.

1452
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,020
I haven't told you boys this yet,

1453
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,180
but I edited our crank call episode

1454
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,820
and we didn't record, we recorded quite a bit

1455
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,420
and it did end up being about 35 minutes long.

1456
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,860
So that's about the hit rate we were working with.

1457
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,820
But it's 35 minutes of pure good cranks

1458
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,500
and how about a final Yahoo?

1459
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,300
Yes.

1460
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,340
This final Yahoo was sent in by a bunch of folks actually.

1461
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,460
Thank you, everybody.

1462
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,220
Another anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1463
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:38,420
who I'm going to call Schneider asks,

1464
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:43,300
why are chihuahuas so expensive when they're so little,

1465
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,820
not really getting your money's worth?

1466
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,500
My name is Justin McElroy.

1467
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,460
I'm Travis McElroy.

1468
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1469
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,260
It's been my brother, my brother,

1470
00:58:54,260 --> 00:59:09,460
may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.
