1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,160
Hi everybody, welcome to- Hey Justin, what's wrong?

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
My brother and my brother and me, whatever. What's the matter?

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,720
Vice show or something. I want to look at the calendar.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah? You see-

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,000
You see, if you look at the my brother, my brother, and me calendar, you see how, um,

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,920
Sunday, February 26th was like, circled, and there's a smiley face. You see,

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
I put like a bunch of happy face stickers on it and stuff.

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Uh-huh. You drew three people sitting on a couch, and they're eating popcorn,

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
and they're laughing and jesting with each other.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,920
Right. That was us watching the Oscars, and it was great. Billy Crystal was just so funny,

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
and such a minch.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Billy Crudup was in rare form.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
Billy Zane was pretty awesome.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,800
Yeah.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,000
Billy O'Connell was Irish, and Billy D. Williams was there.

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,120
I got P.O.D.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,200
Hmm?

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,440
Yeah. I got post-Oscar depression. It's a clinical thing. It's a real disorder,

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,280
and I'm living with it. I'm not dying from it.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,680
Yeah.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,720
Symptoms include just the sorrow that comes from knowing that you're just not

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,000
going to see Billy Crystal again for another, ah, four or five years.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
I mean, at best.

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Justin, can't you self-medicate by watching the SAG Awards, and the Golden Globes,

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
and the Grammys, and the Kids' Choice Awards?

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
And City Slickers, and City Slickers 2.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,560
That's like going to the methadone clinic, though. It's good. It's definitely a way

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
towards healing, but I don't want to kick this addiction.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,200
I just want to—there are no after-effects. There are no side effects of this addiction

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,760
to glamour, this addiction to suspense, the anticipation, the drama, the pomp,

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
the circumstance, the tradition.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,640
Hmm.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,360
To say nothing of the—the gowns.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,920
Yeah.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,520
You could do what I do, Justin.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,240
What's that?

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,320
Live every day like it's a red carpet show.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
A red carpet show, you say?

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
Yes. And as you're walking down the street, just walk up to people and go,

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
who are you wearing?

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,040
Yeah.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Yeah.

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
I've been arrested a couple times.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Who am I wearing? A smile, because I'm living my life on the red carpet right now.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,480
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,520
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to live my life on the red carpet,

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,240
and next year, when the Oscars come on, I'm going to TiVo it,

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm going to watch it minute a day.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,320
Because the problem is, I use it up all at once. I mainline a whole big chunk of Oscar magic,

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,880
when I should be spreading it out as part of my morning prep, morning get-ready ritual.

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,600
Slow drip it.

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,480
Slow drip it. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. Guys, Vegas odds. What are we putting our money on?

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,320
Best pick. Best pick.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,720
You mean for 2013?

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
Best pick for this... Well, yeah, I guess by the time this episode will come out,

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
we'll have missed it.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
I think it was Titanic again.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah, I think Titanic 3D is going to win handily.

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
If you think about how hard it swept.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,960
Can 3D remakes actually win Oscars? Because if so, that's probably not right.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
You just took the movie and you stretched it out, so that it come towards the audience a little bit.

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
When they have the power to move you, which I think Titanic 3D will do.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Right, but Titanic 2D also had that power. Only now it's like,

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,960
well, this ship's coming at me. All right.

73
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,160
But I think because of the economic collapse, it's going to be especially relevant.

74
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm saying I have to put their glasses over my glasses, which are already pretty big,

75
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
and I'm not sure I want to pay money to do that.

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Now, why does that have any bearing on its awards?

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
You've lost me a little bit.

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Movies should be a pleasant experience, right?

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
The movies that win Oscars, the critics, the academy, the people,

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
when they walk out of the movie, they say, ugh, right?

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
They say, oh, man.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,000
Is that a good uh?

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Yeah, yeah, they say, or maybe a bad uh, but I think-

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
That sounded like somebody who had super bad gas.

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
Yeah, nobody walked out of No Country for Old Men with a fucking spring in their step.

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,920
They walked out either confused or kind of lonely.

87
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,280
Yeah, reminded of their eventual ever approaching extermination.

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,200
So it can go, I mean, it can go both ways, but you can't get that experience when you have to

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,760
put a pair of glasses over your fucking glasses so you look like a dad on vacation.

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
You know why No Country for Old Men got people so hard?

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,960
It's because you hear the author's name and it's Cormac McCarthy.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,920
Boy, does that sound like a cheery guy.

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,760
He sounds jovy.

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,120
He sounds like maybe a pub owner who gives you a free bacon with your beer.

95
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
Like a festive jolly, and it's just not that.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
That's not his style at all.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Justin, the name of the movie is No Country for Old Men.

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Yeah.

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Like there are no words in that title that are pleasant.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
Well, then again, it could-

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,760
Unless you cut half of them off and put grumpy at the beginning,

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,720
and then it's like, oh my, this is very funny.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
I guess Travis is an idiot.

104
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,160
Also, No Country for Old Men could be describing like a spring break vacation, right?

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
This place is not for old men.

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,720
No, you're thinking of No Old Men Allowed, which was a much different movie.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
I'm starting a young Shia LaBeouf.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm thinking of Co-Ed Explosion, Shark Attack.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Who would be in No Old Men Allowed?

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
It would probably be Shia LaBeouf and in his final performance, Mr. Pat Morita.

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,480
I would think would be the cast.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Oh, and like Shia LaBeouf dresses up Pat Morita like a young guy to sneak him in.

113
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Hey kids, I'm here.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Wow.

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
Surf's up, wax on.

116
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,580
Great.

117
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
I've just been dumped.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,760
Do you have any suggestions for getting over an ex?

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,360
More importantly, how can I make my ex-boyfriend jealous and or regret leaving me?

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
That's from dashed lines.

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
Now I feel like we've answered the first half of this question a lot, recovery sandwich,

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
but I really want to delve into the second half of this question.

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,720
Or how can I make my ex-boyfriend jealous and or regret leaving me?

124
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,360
The problem is you can't do the second thing while also doing the first thing and vice versa.

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
Wow, that's so true.

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,520
Your heart has got to let go of him and you've got to move on to the next man.

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,880
You see that report that they just came out from all the scientists that said that love

128
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,760
and hate in your brain is like the same part of your brain.

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,680
So when you hate somebody so much because they hurt you, guess what?

130
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
You might as well still love them.

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,880
Yeah.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,380
Yeah.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,600
And the thing is too, like if you're trying to make him jealous and trying to make him

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,840
regret leaving you, you're doing the opposite.

135
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
Yeah.

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,080
Wait.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
And what?

138
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
I don't understand.

139
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,640
Hold on.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,480
I would say that if you are actively like, hey, look how happy I am now,

141
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,400
you're confirming in his mind that he made the right choice.

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,760
Oh, you're saying that by moving on, you're removing one of your best regret weapons and

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,400
that is guilt?

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,040
Guilt.

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,000
So you, she needs to hang on to loneliness and just look like super, super lonely all

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,400
the time.

148
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,840
That's not, I feel like that's not, that's not what Beyonce would do.

149
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,440
No, no.

150
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
What would Beyonce do, Griffin?

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,320
Beyonce would just get a new man and the new man would be incredible.

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah.

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,200
He was at the gym every day and every night he's in front of the stove making up the finest

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,600
cuisine.

155
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,240
He's not wearing a shirt and he's hugging her from behind, he's hugging her from behind

156
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,280
and they're standing in a window and the wind is blowing into the room.

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,960
Now you have to be careful because if you're looking for a man that's not wearing a shirt,

158
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
it could go either way.

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,960
That could go one of two ways, but this man, oh boy.

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,520
This man is impossible.

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
It's impossible for a man to be like this.

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
You've heard of a six pack, he has a 30 pack, it's disgusting.

163
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
He has a cube of abs.

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
It looks like bubble wrap down there.

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,040
He's got a microbrewery inside of him.

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,880
He's got a whole papst inside of him, but he is all man.

167
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,520
That's the quintessential thing, right?

168
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,600
I guess you could hit him up style, blue can trial style.

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,280
You mean steal his credit card and run up a bunch of bills.

170
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
I mean petty theft.

171
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,040
Petty theft, right.

172
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,400
Identity theft.

173
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,040
I always wish that song had ended with her getting locked up.

174
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,200
And then having her ramp it off of a cliff Thelma and Louise style.

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
It'd be quite the caper tune.

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
There aren't enough caper songs.

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
I love caper tunes.

178
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,560
They really do seem just like the purview of the Dixie Chicks.

179
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm saying that Beyonce has had a much more illustrious career than blue can trial.

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
So maybe you should take her advice.

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
Get a man who is just psychedelic to look at.

182
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
If Beyonce is so much better than blue can trial,

183
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,400
maybe you can tell me why she named her baby after her.

184
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, man.

185
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah.

186
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,880
Get Beyonce to name her kid after me.

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Now you're jealous.

188
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
Didn't think I could pull this off.

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
It took 10 years.

190
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Yeah.

191
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
Man, I miss blue can trial.

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,520
That's the longest con blue can trial.

193
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
That's a pretty good con on her part.

194
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Quite a grift from blue can trial.

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
You gotta let it go.

196
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah.

197
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,640
Because what I was about to say was that this is what Facebook is for, but it's not.

198
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
It shouldn't be.

199
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Oh, no.

201
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
You block him.

202
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
He can't see your shit anymore.

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
That's the thing.

204
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,200
I think anything that you do, you're just digging yourself in deeper.

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,840
Like you need to let go of this on so many levels.

206
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Like, yeah.

207
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
The regret will come just like naturally, I think.

208
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah.

209
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
You're great.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
You're awesome.

211
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
He's going to realize it.

212
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
And then he's going to be like, what'd I do?

213
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,320
I did it so wrong.

214
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
And then he's going to feel bad.

215
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,440
You've got to make sure your, you know, your Facebook is full of pictures of you

216
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
and impossible Dave, the impossibly handsome man.

217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Just like skiing while like he's reading Bible stories to local orphans.

218
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Just having the time of your lives.

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
Standing in a window without a shirt, maybe.

220
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah.

221
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,080
Just like the sun's rays.

222
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,160
His muscles rippling in the breeze.

223
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
He's ordering your drink at Starbucks.

224
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,160
That's so big.

225
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,440
They don't even put it on the menu.

226
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,440
He knows about the name of it.

227
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
And he's the only one.

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
It's a really special drink and he's sharing it with you.

229
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Let me get a Gordo.

230
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
Can I a Gordo, please?

231
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Gordo drip.

232
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey, I recently started Griffin.

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,560
No, you know what?

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
I was about to read the next question, but I'm going to do an executive order here until

235
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm going to tell you to read me a Yahoo question from the Yahoo Answers service.

236
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,080
I will ratify that.

237
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay.

238
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you have to do that?

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,560
Can I get a second?

240
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
Can I get a second?

241
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,080
It's ratified.

242
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,560
This one was sent in by Sarah Rimmer.

243
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Thank you, Sarah.

244
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user firerescue343 who asks, I have been drinking.

245
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,960
Help.

246
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,280
This is my first time drinking alcohol ever and I'm drunk.

247
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
How do I get sober?

248
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
I've tried to sleep.

249
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
I can't help.

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
We've all been there, right?

251
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,120
Have we?

252
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,160
The first time your mind goes to a place that it's never been before?

253
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,240
Yeah, we all need an Apache guide.

254
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
I have before been to that place where it's like, well, this is my life from now on.

255
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm never going to not be this ever again.

256
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
This is just how I'm going to be now.

257
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,480
This is how things are forever.

258
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,680
But once again, I love our modern age because I did not run to the internet.

259
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,520
Tell everyone about it.

260
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,840
That's a pretty good the first time I got drunk story.

261
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
First time I got drunk, I got so drunk that I had to ask the internet.

262
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,280
The internet had to guide me out with its trustworthy hand.

263
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,200
And I'm sure the internet was super supportive because that's what you want.

264
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,240
That's what you want is your wingman when you're tripping through the mind fantastic.

265
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Step one, just breathe.

266
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,520
We're going to make it through it OK.

267
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Yeah, you're all you're doing now is exploring the boundaries of your own limits.

268
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm here for you, brother.

269
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
I'm here.

270
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,560
Just refresh.

271
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm here.

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,400
I mean, there are people that are like offering extremely helpful but thoroughly scientific

273
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,200
advice like your body will digest roughly one unit of alcohol per hour.

274
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,920
One times four hundred and forty milliliters can of Stella is two point two units.

275
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,720
A whole seven hundred and fifty milliliter bottle of vodka whiskey.

276
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm drunk right now.

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm so drunk.

278
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
What does this mean?

279
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
What does this mean?

280
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,840
I can't do math.

281
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Get your science out of here and say maybe it's like take your shoes off.

282
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,400
Put your feet on the floor and feel it and then make the spins go away.

283
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Drink a bunch of water and take some ibuprofen.

284
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,320
You maybe do some and then maybe do some math apparently.

285
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,520
Yeah, like long division to figure out how fucked you are.

286
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080
Answer very because what's your BMI?

287
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
OK, first figure out your BMI and then we're going to get through this.

288
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Can you remember the first time that like when you start drinking at the age of 21 legally,

289
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,120
when you start, when you kick that process off, you have no context for how much of this devil

290
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
juice you have to put in your body to feel good.

291
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,360
There's and there's a thin, thin needle you have to thread between like, ah, this feels great.

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
And oh, no, what do I do?

293
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
Do you remember the first time?

294
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,760
And by first time, I mean probably the first time you ever drink that you were like, oh,

295
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
fuck, I shot the cannon indoors.

296
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah, I can remember being being in a hotel and running around wildly,

297
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,280
trying to just trying to find some sort of semblance of of reality.

298
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah, this was so messed up about the Yahoo Answers question.

299
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
Is it I'm 31 years old and sometimes.

300
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,800
I still mess it up.

301
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,160
I'll be at an event I'm uncomfortable with and suddenly I'll realize that I'm trying to impress

302
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,520
the international medicine doctor that Sydney knows while he's telling me stories about visiting

303
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,320
Ecuador.

304
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm trying to impress him because once I saw Jungle to Jungle on TV, yes.

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,600
The worst part of that moment is you're watching like a slow wave like hit you.

306
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,880
Yeah, at first you're like, oh, fun.

307
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,680
I'm drunk.

308
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,000
And that lasts for about three and a half seconds.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,400
And you're like, oh, I got to deal with this now.

310
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Oh, no, this is my situation right here.

311
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
It's a minefield.

312
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
No one else is this drunk.

313
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,680
It's just me.

314
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,520
And the one thing I find it impossible to do when I'm in that place and the one thing

315
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,240
that I should do to get through it is I lose that voice that says, you don't need to contribute

316
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
this to this conversation.

317
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,480
Just keep your keep a lid on that.

318
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,760
You don't have to let him know.

319
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Yeah, that's that.

320
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,560
Keep that.

321
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
Keep your secret.

322
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
Wouldn't it be great if you did that one time, you know, like talking to like a foreign ambassador

323
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,240
just like, bro, I'm sorry to interrupt your story about child labor or whatever.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,720
I just got real drunk.

325
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
And he was like, it's cool, bro.

326
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,280
We've all been there.

327
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,520
You want me to go get you some water or something?

328
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,400
It's cool, man.

329
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,520
You're going to come down from this.

330
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,240
It's OK.

331
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,640
Mr. President, what happened to Tastations?

332
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,360
What can you use like your legal orders?

333
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,160
I was thinking about you're the president and you could do an executive order to make

334
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
Tastations again.

335
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,200
Open up.

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,760
It's think of jobs, job growth.

337
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Think of the job growth.

338
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,600
So I heard you used to smoke.

339
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:24,480
Do you want to dog pound it out of here and just I'm sorry to catch a butt outside and

340
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,440
we'll talk about discontinued hard chocolates.

341
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
You're the coolest president ever.

342
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,280
You're really cool.

343
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
No, I mean that.

344
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
No, seriously, I mean that.

345
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,720
And I think you I think you might be a lamppost.

346
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
I think I might be outside.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,680
I might have been outside this whole time.

348
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,040
I might have been outside this whole time.

349
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,320
But listen, you know what?

350
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,600
I want to go to Yahoo Answers.

351
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
I love you, President Lamppost.

352
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,720
I got to go.

353
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
I got to go see if they can help me because I'm so lost right now.

354
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,640
I want to.

355
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
Who is this person?

356
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
Who is this person?

357
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
I'm going to try drinking.

358
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,240
I know the perfect time and place to do this.

359
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,120
It's a social.

360
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
They say you have a problem with alcohol if you start drinking alone.

361
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
This person like opened with that.

362
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah.

363
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
Where's he got to build to?

364
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
Yeah, I'm just going to sit in a room and drink vodka.

365
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,040
I mean, that's not a bad idea because this dude can drape himself in the anonymity of

366
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,160
the internet like a warm, soothing blanket and then ride this out and then understand

367
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
how much booze he needs to take.

368
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,080
But if he's at a party, then it's going to be a bad, rough, rough scene.

369
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,680
Griffin, could you do me one favor real quick?

370
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,400
Sure.

371
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
Read me his username again.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
It's a fire rescue 343.

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Oh, no.

374
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
Yeah, I hope he wasn't on on fireman call.

375
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,960
This is why it's so important that our nation's 14, 15, 16 year old start drinking because

376
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
everyone has that embarrassing college experience.

377
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,720
Or maybe they do.

378
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
Maybe not everyone, but many have that embarrassing college experience where they they didn't

379
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
know their own limits and they drank too much and they got sloppy.

380
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,640
If we start our kids drinking at 13, 14, 15, they're going to be like Hawkeye Pierce and

381
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,560
BJ sipping martinis and just living life, living it up.

382
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,760
Can we not bring this into our public school system and alongside like sex ed have like

383
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
party ed where it's like, listen, if you're at a music festival and somebody offers you

384
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,280
opium, don't do it, but if you do have a buddy, take you to the chill out.

385
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
You want to find the most air conditioned bus that is there and go in that.

386
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,640
We had a party ed at our high school, but everyone told me he graduated in 87 and he

387
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
was just usually sitting at the bleachers.

388
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
That was my party ed.

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,320
He's a good man, though, and he was best man at wedding.

390
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,200
I love him very much.

391
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,080
I love you, party ed.

392
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,800
Everything I know.

393
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Thank you, party ed.

394
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,680
Thank you for your tutelage.

395
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,760
Hey, I recently started working on a project with a friend for the project.

396
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,440
My friend was, I'm guessing that that accent is appropriate.

397
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,640
I haven't read the question.

398
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,760
Something felt strange when I was reading his work, so I Google line of what he wrote

399
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
only to find out that he had plagiarized it.

400
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,320
When I confronted him, he said that he did not and that I am crazy, even though he is

401
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,280
clearly lying.

402
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
This is not a new thing.

403
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,080
He has even come to me with an idea for a podcast where he gives out fake advice.

404
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
Now it's personal.

405
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,920
Help me, brothers.

406
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Do I take the project for my own or should I just cancel the project altogether?

407
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
That is from Zucked in Zuckersburg.

408
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,960
That's great.

409
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,200
Oh, man.

410
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,560
He did get Zucked.

411
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
It sounds like we're about to get fucking Zucked.

412
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
We need to shut this kid down.

413
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,520
Okay, listen, you no account motherfucker, you're dead.

414
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
You're dead and you don't even know it.

415
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,760
You're walking around talking, eating liquor made, and you don't even know you're dead.

416
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,800
You are dead.

417
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,640
We know lawyers and we know desperate, desperate people.

418
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
People that would do anything for liquor made.

419
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,040
They love liquor made and we know where to get it.

420
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,640
The only place you can get it is this one shitty gas station in Chilla Coffee.

421
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,680
And we're not going to tell anyone which shitty gas station in Chilla Coffee.

422
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,400
No, we're not telling anybody that we have a currency and it's liquor made and we can get anything we want.

423
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,040
Okay?

424
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,520
So you better back off and come up with another podcast idea or steal somebody else's.

425
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:44,560
Maybe two friends chat about the events of the day or a bespectacled man judges people.

426
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,200
I love it.

427
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
Fairly or unfairly.

428
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
Maybe that's an idea you could do.

429
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,160
Two Canadians and a comedian friend yuck it up.

430
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,520
Right.

431
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,600
That's the new tagline that I've come up for, for stop podcasting yourself.

432
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Oh, and call it start podcasting yourself.

433
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,040
Yeah.

434
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,480
Yeah, that's alphabetically you've trumped them, which is, as we all know-

435
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,720
Commence podcasting yourself.

436
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
Start podcasting a time.

437
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,160
Time to podcast.

438
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,320
Just bring it back, Captain Kangaroo.

439
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
He's not making his TV show new, what are you making into a podcast?

440
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Yeah, don't steal anything but our show.

441
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
This is all we got.

442
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,040
Don't steal.

443
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,400
Remake.

444
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah.

445
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Remake, reboot, refresh the franchise.

446
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,840
Do you know what I mean?

447
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh my God.

448
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,120
What if this kid remixed, refreshed, rebooted My Brother, My Brother, and Me?

449
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
With Captain Kangaroo.

450
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
The My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

451
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,200
The sequel.

452
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,760
It's new.

453
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
It's got Vanderbeek.

454
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
It's got Tony Maguire.

455
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,600
You just gotta call like the ultimate My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

456
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,160
Right.

457
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,240
My Brother, My Brother, and Me babies.

458
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,040
Ultimate universe.

459
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Ultimate universe two.

460
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,080
2022.

461
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,880
My Brother, My Brother, and Me 2099 babies.

462
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
Baby YZs.

463
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,920
Rebirth.

464
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,400
Rebirth.

465
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Exodus.

466
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Holiday special.

467
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,440
Uh, so there are plenty of other ideas for podcasts out there.

468
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
And honestly, aren't podcasts more important than whatever this dumbass project you're

469
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,560
working on for school is?

470
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,880
Listen, none of us are going to high school anymore.

471
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
We all dropped out to make podcasts.

472
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Yeah.

473
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,600
And if you can get a pretty good idea, everyone, I'd drop this project altogether.

474
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
Yeah, but not when you stole from someone else.

475
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Or not when you stole specifically from us.

476
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Yeah.

477
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
And you know what?

478
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,800
I just realized reading back over this question.

479
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,960
The project I don't think is for school.

480
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,480
Like, this is just a fun project they're doing together, right?

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,000
This is-

482
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,880
Can you pick a more abstract word to describe the thing you're doing?

483
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
A project.

484
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah, we're building a soapbox.

485
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,160
But I'm just wondering, like, who's like, hey, let's do a fun thing together.

486
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,560
Okay, let me go plagiarize some stuff.

487
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,800
Sure.

488
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,320
It just seems-

489
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
Sometimes you get overwhelmed.

490
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Your friend, Zucked, in Zuckerberg, has great taste in podcasts and he's got a lot of great ideas.

491
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
And you think, I wish I had some of his ideas.

492
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
And then you get somebody else's ideas.

493
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
But there are fucking ideas.

494
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,040
Yeah.

495
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
Please, please stop stealing our ideas.

496
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,800
You're standing on the shoulders of giants.

497
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,680
And we're the giants.

498
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,800
Do you know what plagiarism-

499
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,920
Get off of our shoulders.

500
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
We're little giants.

501
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
We can't take the pressure.

502
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
We just plagiarized little giants.

503
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,200
Just by mentioning it.

504
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,700
Dammit.

505
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
But he forced us into it.

506
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,800
I feel real pressured now to come up with a new idea for a podcast as this guy's moving in.

507
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,120
And the little giants fan cast is it.

508
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,960
That's right.

509
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,320
Little, little giants.

510
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
My fan cast.

511
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
Little giants, where are they now?

512
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,840
They might be little giants, a fan cast about little giants.

513
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,560
The movie that nobody saw but the three people who are currently speaking.

514
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
So hope you like the goofs, everyone.

515
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,440
Good night.

516
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,200
Okay, if you were to make a kid's sports podcast that is about, it could be about angels in the

517
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,880
outfield, little giants, little big league, little big league, rookie of the year, big green-

518
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
Guts, guts, global guts.

519
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
Guts, global guts, Bad News Bears and Bad News Bears remake.

520
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Yeah.

521
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,440
What was that one with Keanu Reeves where he taught all the inner city kids a thing or two

522
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,240
about baseball?

523
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Ladybugs.

524
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
No, it was called a thing or two about baseball.

525
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,360
A thing or two about baseball.

526
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
Ladybugs would be good.

527
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,480
Heavyweights.

528
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,280
Heavyweights, sure, yeah.

529
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
There's go-kart racing in that against the-

530
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
Dropping LBs is the ultimate sport.

531
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,440
Torturing Ben Stiller is the most rewarding game.

532
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,680
I think that'll be a pretty good podcast.

533
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,720
Why don't you make that one?

534
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
Yeah, here, that one's yours.

535
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,360
We just wrapped a little ribbon around it.

536
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
Go fucking take it, but don't take ours.

537
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,120
Take it.

538
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,240
Or I'll plagiarize somebody who murdered someone sometime to your friend.

539
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,320
I'll show them, I'll rip off their style, but I'll do it on your friend, the murder.

540
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
Can you go over this for me one more time?

541
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,320
Yeah, I'm trying.

542
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
John Wayne Gacy, he was a murderer, right?

543
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,480
He murdered kids, though.

544
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,160
Who didn't murder kids?

545
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,840
Who was just an all-around murderer?

546
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,120
Jack the Ripper.

547
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,240
Jack the Ripper murdered women.

548
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,120
I'm gonna steal his style of murder, and I'll kill your fucking friend.

549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,600
Okay, let's cut out all the jibba-jabba.

550
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,880
You're gonna murder somebody.

551
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,280
You're just talking around in circles.

552
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm not gonna guarantee murder this guy, but if a show called

553
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,360
Three Siblings and One, I'll fucking kill him.

554
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,000
He's dead.

555
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,360
He's dead.

556
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,320
He doesn't even know it.

557
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,880
He's dead.

558
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,480
So, uh, you do whatever you want with your project, because it might not be a problem anymore,

559
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
because it sounds like we're gonna have to kill your friend.

560
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah.

561
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,280
Sorry.

562
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,720
Sorry you wrote in, and this blood is on your hand.

563
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
You'll hear from our lawyers.

564
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,760
Our dead.

565
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
Our, if they don't kill them first.

566
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
Our lawyers are ghosts.

567
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Everyone we know is a ghost or a horse.

568
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
That's sort of our thing.

569
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,240
Griffin?

570
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,720
Yep.

571
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
That's sort of the theme.

572
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
Can you read me a Yahoo answer, please?

573
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,680
Sure, sure, sure.

574
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Sure, sure, sure.

575
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,240
This'll flow nicely.

576
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
This is sent in by Emily Wall.

577
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Thank you, Emily.

578
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nom, who asks, demon hunter, help me.

579
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,000
Wait.

580
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
I want to be a demon hunter.

581
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,720
I beg you guys.

582
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
Real demon hunters out there?

583
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,280
Knock, knock.

584
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,000
Answer me.

585
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,880
Teach me.

586
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,280
I want to be a demon hunter and the best.

587
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Please answer me.

588
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,040
I only want answers from the real ones, not the wannabes or the nonbelievers.

589
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,920
There's nothing worse than wannabe demon hunters.

590
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,480
Yeah.

591
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm trying to-

592
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
They bought all their demon hunting gear from L.L. Bean.

593
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm trying to make a circle of salt to capture a fey and it's like, whoa, what'd I trip over?

594
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,960
Like, get out of here.

595
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,960
You, you wannabe demon hunter.

596
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,200
Some of us are trying to track down the Balrog.

597
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,440
Buddy.

598
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,480
Buddy.

599
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,360
That guy wouldn't know a werewolf from a wolf man.

600
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,600
Do you think in the world of demon hunters, like the lowest tier are like the Sasquatch hunters?

601
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,960
Yeah.

602
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
They're just wandering around in circles and looking.

603
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,800
I am convinced that Sasquatch hunters are just looking for a cover to have gay sex in the woods.

604
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,440
They do keep saying the word squash a lot.

605
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,640
They say squash a lot.

606
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
That's clue one.

607
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
Clue two, it's just two guys.

608
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,640
Like in any other culture, the fact that two guys in a tent go to the woods,

609
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,200
stay for some unspecified amount of time and come back with nothing.

610
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,280
They are having secret gay sex with each other that they're hiding from their wives.

611
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Because the alternative is that they're looking for a shit that does not exist in the real world.

612
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,800
I sooner understand fishing and that's just hurting fish for no reason.

613
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,880
That's just being mean to fish.

614
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,440
That's just being mean to fish, which after seeing that movie about Nemo,

615
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,800
I don't see how anybody could do that.

616
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,840
You're stretching this out to encompass basically all folklore.

617
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,680
So across the globe, like Chupacabra, Loch Ness Monster,

618
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,200
these are just different reasons for different countries

619
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
and different cultures to have secret gay sex.

620
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,840
Loch Ness Monster, two Scottish gay guys wanted to have sex by a lake.

621
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Area 51, a bunch of people in Nevada got together in the desert.

622
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,920
For dusty sex.

623
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,240
Dusty bone circle is what they did.

624
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,720
And then they came back like, yeah, we found a bunker.

625
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,200
It was great.

626
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,880
Great, we can't ever find it again, but it's no big deal.

627
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
What other mythological beasts?

628
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm trying to-

629
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,440
Spring-heeled Jack.

630
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,360
Spring-heeled Jack, is that Jack the Ripper?

631
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,720
I don't know.

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,400
He was quite real.

633
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What about Champion, Lake Champlain?

634
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
What is that?

635
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,080
That's like America's Loch Ness Monster.

636
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,720
Okay, well, do you remember what I was talking about?

637
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
No, I think that's real.

638
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
That one is actually real.

639
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,160
That one's true.

640
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,280
Jersey Devil, real.

641
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,840
Mothman.

642
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Two older gentlemen from the Point Pleasant area who wanted to have gay sex under a bridge.

643
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,480
I see.

644
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Jackalope even sounds, Jackalope sounds like some sort of gay sex.

645
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
That one's not even a clever disguise.

646
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
That's when two guys named Jack eloped together.

647
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:44,880
Yeah.

648
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,120
Yeah, that's, wow, that's a little on the, what I'm saying is basically

649
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,760
the entire cryptozoology field.

650
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,480
Dinosaurs.

651
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,080
Dinosaurs, obviously cavemen wanting to have gay sex with each other.

652
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
Oh, that's a huge conspiracy.

653
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
A lot of bucks went into forging that one.

654
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,200
That one must be for like, I don't know, rich museum owners to have gay sex with each other.

655
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,320
My name is Stephen J. Smithsonian and I'd like to have secret gay sex with another man.

656
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,200
I know dinosaurs.

657
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,800
Welcome to Jurassic Secret Gay Sex Dungeon.

658
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Welcome to Jurassic Pork.

659
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,600
Fuck, you're so sweaty.

660
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,800
Oh, man.

661
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,240
Hey, Deb, I'm gonna be back next weekend.

662
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,560
I'm just gonna go out, look for some mega fauna with Gary.

663
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,320
I'll come back.

664
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,040
Hopefully nothing hurts me out there in the wild.

665
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,720
Uh, that's not real.

666
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
That's not a real thing you're going out looking for and everybody knows it.

667
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,040
Dude, I don't think everybody knows it, Justin.

668
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,280
I think that there are some groups of people that have gone out there looking for el chupacabra

669
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,800
and what they have found instead is, hey, I had such a fun time looking for chupacabra.

670
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,400
Let's, let's.

671
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,680
How much would you hate to be the rookie sasquatch hunter that's really in it to find the sasquatch

672
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,440
and you're really passionate about it?

673
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
True believer.

674
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,800
And like you roll up and like you find a group of guys like, yeah, we're sasquatch hunters

675
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,320
and like they're all winking at each other and like, oh, they know where the sasquatch is.

676
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,480
I'm going with those guys and then you get out there.

677
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,640
The fucking witching hour rolls around and it's, it's dicks out, everyone.

678
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,080
Everyone dicks.

679
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,880
Dicks ahoy.

680
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
Dennis, I'm butting your pants.

681
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,280
We're going to find a sasquatch.

682
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,840
Come here, you big, you big fire monster.

683
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
You know what they say about big feet.

684
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,680
What's up?

685
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Sasquatch.

686
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
Squatchin' it.

687
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,360
Let's squatch together.

688
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,080
That's why they call secret gay sex sasquatch.

689
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
But this is interesting.

690
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,560
This only applies to men.

691
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,240
If women want to have secret gay sex with each other, they just do it because they're grownups.

692
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,040
They do it like adults.

693
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,920
They don't hide in the forest and pretend to be looking for the, uh, the globster or goat man.

694
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,520
Hoedog.

695
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,880
What's a, what's a globster?

696
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,720
Oh, sorry.

697
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,200
Say again.

698
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,920
A globster.

699
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,640
Globster.

700
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
A globster is a b- a blob.

701
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,920
A glob that's also a lobster, obviously.

702
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,640
It's, it's a blob from New Zealand.

703
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,360
Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty brutal.

704
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,080
But listen, guys, just admit you love each other and live your lives.

705
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,280
And stop go- just leave Sasquatch alone.

706
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,840
Uh, yeah.

707
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,680
He's got, he's got better things to do.

708
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:51,440
He's got better things to do to avoid the, the clumsy advances of a bunch of closeted homosexual men.

709
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,760
I'm, uh, I'm looking back at the Yahoo page and I just want to share a couple of responses.

710
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:06,000
One was by Yahoo Answers user Mastema, whose, uh, image is, I would say, uh, an absolutely terrifying

711
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,280
pale white face with murderous red lips and, uh, a long black hair.

712
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,080
Uh, and he says, stop hunting.

713
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
I came to you.

714
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,080
Kill me.

715
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Whaaat?

716
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,840
And then, uh, right below him is WickedVamp whose profile, I would say, fits the exact

717
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,400
description I just gave you, uh, who says, pulls up a chair.

718
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,440
Okay, demon hunter, let's see you do your thing.

719
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,400
Mastema, looks like we know what's for dinner tonight.

720
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,940
Oops!

721
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,240
Whoopsies!

722
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,600
And then the third one that says, guys, this is your dad.

723
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,480
Get off the computer.

724
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:42,800
Whoops!

725
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
Calm down to dinner.

726
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,600
Aw, man, looks like you accidentally role-played on Yahoo Answers.

727
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,440
That was the thing you did there.

728
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,940
Oops!

729
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,980
Oops!

730
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,140
I'm waiting for a call from work and I can't get it while you guys are on the modem.

731
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,220
Please log, please log off.

732
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,740
Oh, oh, god damn.

733
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,700
People, people, demon, demon hunters.

734
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Are there more answers about demon hunters?

735
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,500
The thread, the thread there just stopped.

736
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,700
I mean, there's somebody else who says, you Twittered soul.

737
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,460
Why would you like to become a hunter?

738
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,060
You not join us.

739
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,020
So I think they were also going for I'm a demon.

740
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,980
No, let's be honest.

741
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,220
Demons would not be good at typing.

742
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,500
No, because they have like three fingers and it's like all claws.

743
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,260
Yeah, it's all claws and prongs down there.

744
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,100
What if the best place, would you be shocked to find that the best ways to find demons is

745
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,300
on Yahoo Answers?

746
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,340
I would be shocked.

747
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,500
Like if that turned out like they've all been there.

748
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,580
I would be shocked if the best place to find them was literally anywhere else.

749
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,060
I think this is a breeding ground.

750
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,980
I think that Yahoo Answers web servers are built on a fucking hell mouth.

751
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,500
This sounds like, this sounds like the spinoff series that Blake Lively is going to do.

752
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,900
I used to be just a normal average girl to one day on Yahoo Answers.

753
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,180
I found demons and now I hunt them because I'm half demon.

754
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,900
And also we got canceled.

755
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,140
Sorry dad, I messed up.

756
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,300
Hey Griffin.

757
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,620
What?

758
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,940
You know where I go looking for demons?

759
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:24,980
Where do you go?

760
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,940
My impersonal demons?

761
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,420
Where do you go?

762
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,660
Money.

763
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,580
That's, that's my, that's my demon.

764
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,540
That's the monkey on my back.

765
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,180
That's your vice?

766
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,860
That's my vice is the pursuit of the green stuff.

767
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,460
The old green bats, sawbucks.

768
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
And there's only one cure for that.

769
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,780
Presidential flashcards!

770
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,540
Presidential flashcards, baby.

771
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,540
Deb Prezos.

772
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,580
Yum yum, give me some.

773
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,460
Today we're getting taken to the money zone by Apple and Kiwi Comics.

774
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,300
According to the information that has been provided to me,

775
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:16,020
it is the story of a moderately insane adventure with his lazier and less insane adventure friend.

776
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,780
And they live together in a, they live fairly average city lives,

777
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,100
not including the nightmarish creatures, the kidnappings, and journeys to strange places.

778
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,820
Also, their dog is a cactus.

779
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,140
You left out the fact that one's black and one's white.

780
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,580
Because I-

781
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,700
You won't guess which one.

782
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,700
They said, they said that in the email to us to say to everyone else.

783
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:42,100
Because it's one's moderately insane black adventurer and his lazier and less insane white adventurer.

784
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Right, I don't, I didn't understand specifically what role race played in Apple and Kiwi Comics.

785
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,900
I assumed it's like in Final Fantasy you have like the the white mage and the black mage.

786
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,940
One's a black adventurer, one's a white adventurer.

787
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,900
That's good, Travis.

788
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,460
Oh, one follows the forces of chaos, the other the forces of peace.

789
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,100
I like that.

790
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,300
Hold on, because we might be getting racist again.

791
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,660
Okay.

792
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,620
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

793
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,580
I just mean-

794
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,420
You mean that one is unruly.

795
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,820
One is-

796
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,460
I mean that-

797
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,700
Would you say savage, Justin?

798
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,780
White is good and black is bad.

799
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,660
I don't see-

800
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,620
What's the pro-

801
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,580
Oh no!

802
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,660
What problem in my head?

803
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,340
So Apple and Kiwi Comics.

804
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,900
AppleandKiwiComics.com.

805
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Check it out.

806
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,540
Check it out.

807
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,100
And if you need-

808
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,620
If you need to wash away the dirt of our racism.

809
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,780
Need to wash away the dirt of accidentally thinking you might have sounded racist on

810
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,660
your comedy podcast, boy have I got a soap for you.

811
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,980
It's stack soap and it's soap that stacks.

812
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,420
I know what you're saying, witchcraft.

813
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:56,900
Illegal.

814
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,340
Uh, no.

815
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,140
Black magic.

816
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,900
Black magic, fuck!

817
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,100
Fuck!

818
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,660
You need some white soap to clean up your black magic.

819
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,380
Oh fuck!

820
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,220
God damn it!

821
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,460
Shit!

822
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,340
Shit!

823
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,780
Okay, I'm gonna try again.

824
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,580
Soap that goes into another soap is stack soap.

825
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,420
The soap squashes together.

826
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:29,380
When you've used up one bar of soap till you just have a sliver, a stupid sliver,

827
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:36,900
there's a crevasse in the next bar of stack soap that is specifically made so that your

828
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,180
sliver can go inside the new bar.

829
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,900
So you will never miss out on using soap again.

830
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,900
How does this interface with the shampoo suds that I use as soap?

831
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,420
It is going to completely negate your need for them because you'll finally have real

832
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,260
soap like a real boy.

833
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,100
Travis, you used stack soap while visiting me this weekend.

834
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,900
What'd you think?

835
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,580
I was surprised to find it did not dry out my skin and it left me feeling cleaner than

836
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,500
I believe I've ever felt before in my life.

837
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,420
Wonderful.

838
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,700
That's a god's honest.

839
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,300
Stack Soap's looking for your contributions to help get them off the ground.

840
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,380
You can go to stacksoap.com.

841
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:28,820
They've already met their fundraising goal, but they're still taking donations and you

842
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:35,220
can still get a lot of great soap for a pretty darn good price as you help a burgeoning young

843
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,420
business find its footing.

844
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,100
So go to stacksoap.com.

845
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:45,380
Griffin, I believe you have a song about apple and kiwi that you have prepared that makes

846
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,300
no mention to skin color.

847
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,420
Can you swing that for me?

848
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,780
Yeah, this is going to be a tricky wicket.

849
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:00,500
I was going to do a goof, like I downloaded a fart piano app on my phone, but now the

850
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,580
waters are choppy enough as is.

851
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,420
Oh, I think I should really give this one.

852
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,220
Okay.

853
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:16,980
Whether you're black or white or wrong or right, not that black people are wrong and

854
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:24,260
white people are right all the time, you got to go on adventures with your ethically diverse

855
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,060
friends.

856
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:32,420
That's the best kind of adventure you can have at appleandkiwicomics.com.

857
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,820
No.

858
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,020
Appleandkiwicomics.com.

859
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,740
Was that racist?

860
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,780
Was the song racist?

861
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,300
No, not at all.

862
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,980
I said that black people were wrong.

863
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,180
You said not that they were wrong.

864
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,540
It was a couplet.

865
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,060
It was obviously a couplet.

866
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:53,060
That's the listener introducing his own racist parallelism into your song that's just about

867
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,820
friends and adventure.

868
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,260
And race.

869
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,460
And race.

870
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,420
You've been working on a stack soap song.

871
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,500
Yeah, I've been thinking about doing a right in the middle, like right after the first

872
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:19,940
bridge, doing like a fart piano solo, so like right there.

873
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,220
I shouldn't find that as funny as I do.

874
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,580
You certainly shouldn't.

875
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,340
Why am I four years old?

876
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,740
It's going to be good.

877
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,220
It's going to be good.

878
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,420
How many more weeks?

879
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,020
Wait, I think you got like two more weeks to come up with something.

880
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,140
But so Griffin will have something pretty sick by the time all is said and done.

881
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,100
It's going to be pretty great.

882
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,980
But we'll have to keep following his jingle progress for a stack soap.

883
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,340
Hey, and if you're looking for a more racially sensitive podcast, might as

884
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,220
suggest any on the Maximum Fun Network.

885
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,540
Here's an ad for one right now.

886
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,060
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's Radio Sweetheart.

887
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,220
And I'm Jordan Morris, Bully Detective.

888
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,260
Every week on our show, Jordan Jesse Go, I would say that we share a little slice

889
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,580
of our hearts and a little peek at our dicks.

890
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,380
But every week we have a podcast where we have fun and funny conversations with

891
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,260
guests from the worlds of comedy, film, television.

892
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,740
It's all online at Maximumfun.org or just search for Jordan Jesse Go in iTunes.

893
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,820
Hey, are bulges in the crotch area of a guy's pants socially acceptable?

894
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,020
My friend is poor and has very few pairs of pants.

895
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,580
One he got recently at a Goodwill causes a rather noticeable man

896
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,500
lump in his groin region.

897
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,580
He asked me if they were OK and being a guy myself, I had no good answer for him.

898
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,820
Do the ladies find this attractive?

899
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,580
Are there specific social events where this kind of thing is accepted?

900
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,460
Encouraged?

901
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,420
That's from awkward in Arvana.

902
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,860
Does this person think that this guy, when he bought the pants at Goodwill,

903
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,940
it already had a boner in it?

904
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,340
He didn't.

905
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,180
I'm so confused as to the premise.

906
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,580
Is this like the pants are so tight that you can see all the nooks and crannies?

907
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,780
Or is this like because of like the way it's sewn and when you put on a belt,

908
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,860
it just naturally like lumps up?

909
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,900
Or are you saying your fucking buddy has got priapism

910
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
and you don't know how to deal with that reality?

911
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:34,180
I do think that if your friend has priapism, he's suffering from that.

912
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,100
You do need to get convincing to see a doctor.

913
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,460
That's your duty as a friend.

914
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,820
Do these new pants rub against this thing in a way that is vaguely pleasurable?

915
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:43,940
No.

916
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,420
He just is a medical freak, is what you say.

917
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,300
He likes new pants.

918
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,820
He likes new old pants.

919
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,260
He loves new old pants.

920
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,620
Hey, you know, I as personally, I mean, personally, I love this.

921
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,340
I love women have the ladies been walking around for like

922
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,660
All time?

923
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,340
Like long all time.

924
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,540
10,000 years.

925
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,620
Bosoms full blast.

926
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:13,940
Yeah.

927
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,900
Like the ladies have them cranked up.

928
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,500
Can you turn down your bosoms, please?

929
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,260
Because I can't hear you over your bosoms.

930
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,620
The ladies turned up the bosoms full blast and then they tore off the knob.

931
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,060
So I love that guys see that and say, you know what?

932
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,740
I'm turning the tables on this.

933
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,540
I'm going to go on my bulge on full blast.

934
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,220
Now here is the caveat to this.

935
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,660
The ladies will not enjoy that.

936
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
It is not in any way intriguing.

937
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,540
Well, maybe we're just not doing it right yet.

938
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,020
Like maybe we need to come up with pants with a little slit so you can just see like,

939
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,300
I don't know, a couple inches of the right side of the shaft.

940
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,580
Yeah.

941
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,460
You're talking like junk cleavage.

942
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,620
That's what I'm talking about is shaft cleavage.

943
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,420
Yeah.

944
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,740
Sure.

945
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,060
Why not?

946
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:06,660
Why is it okay for ladies to show one third to like two fifths of a boob and that it's

947
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,860
not okay for a guy to walk around with a little-

948
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:15,460
With an inch to an inch and a half of clear plastic right down there just showing off

949
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,700
one of the edges of the shaft.

950
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,100
Just a-

951
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,700
Maybe just some mesh.

952
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,900
A vertical slice.

953
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,820
Some mesh down there and the weave of the mesh is dependent on how formal the event

954
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,300
you're going to.

955
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,020
I love this.

956
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,060
You're going-

957
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,300
Oh, did you see his dicklitage?

958
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,740
Oh, Christ.

959
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,380
TM, don't plagiarize that, you fucking Zuckerberg thief.

960
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,300
Zuck's friend, we're watching you.

961
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:47,860
You know, you go to, if you're going to maybe a wedding or a funeral, you have a tasteful

962
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,540
understated that may, dicklitage-

963
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,900
You don't want to be, you don't want to distract from the groom's dicklitage.

964
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,700
Right, maybe even it looks solid in certain lights.

965
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,060
Ooh, that's a good look.

966
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,740
Do you know who can make dicklitage look great?

967
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,220
If you're at Clooney at the red carpet.

968
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,820
Clooney.

969
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,380
Clooney.

970
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,180
Start this trend.

971
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,460
He could go 2.5 inches of dicklitage down there.

972
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,860
I don't want to think about it.

973
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,900
Colin Farrell sets it off and pretends it's something they've been doing in Ireland for

974
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,140
years.

975
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:19,540
Sure.

976
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,060
That makes it immediately cool.

977
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,260
Yeah, over there, we call it cocklebloggers and something.

978
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,660
And then, that's all the rage over there, the lads love it.

979
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,780
The cocklebloggers.

980
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,900
We've been wearing them since I was weak.

981
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,380
Can you break that word?

982
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,700
In an area over here, it's like, I'm in.

983
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,180
I'm down.

984
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,540
I think we just need to figure out what the appropriate amount of shaft to show is to

985
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,820
get a woman to do the Diamond Dave double take.

986
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,220
Yeah.

987
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,500
Where she lowers her day glow plastic sunglasses.

988
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:46,740
Yeah.

989
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,500
And then, it does a triple like, bam, bam, bam.

990
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,460
Like a zoom.

991
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,300
I have this specially wired dicklitage that every time I peel it open, it plays a record

992
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,100
scratch sound from my crosshair.

993
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,580
Zip-a-dip-a-dip-a-dip-a-dip-bam.

994
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:02,900
What?

995
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,180
What?

996
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,820
That's the sound a woman makes when she's doing a Diamond Dave double take.

997
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,500
She does a fucking Scatman riff?

998
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
She turns into Scatman Carruthers.

999
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:12,820
Yeah.

1000
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,220
Well, if you guys have never made a woman do it, then I'm not surprised you don't know

1001
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:17,700
what she sounds like.

1002
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,900
I have never made a lady, I have never ever made a lady squee-de-beep with her mouth.

1003
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,180
But I've never experimented with dicklitage.

1004
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,140
Yep.

1005
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,380
Yeah.

1006
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,260
Well, I spent some time over in Europe, so.

1007
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,700
Oh, sure, sure.

1008
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,580
It's all the rage over there.

1009
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,780
Yeah, that explains it.

1010
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,780
My buddy Colin Farrell showed me what to do.

1011
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,540
I went to Burning Man.

1012
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,820
It was edible down there.

1013
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,620
What do I care?

1014
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,060
Set it off.

1015
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,420
It wasn't made to be edible.

1016
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,420
It wasn't made to be edible, but it was a long weekend.

1017
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,740
We all made a lot of mistakes.

1018
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,140
So I guess, yes?

1019
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,580
Is that, like, what's the answer?

1020
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,060
No?

1021
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,740
I don't, if you got a bulge, there's no guarantee it's not a tumor.

1022
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,980
Yeah.

1023
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,260
That's all I'm saying to you.

1024
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,780
I'll be worried about you if I see that.

1025
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,340
Hey, let's get you to, let's get that train.

1026
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,820
I can see your healthy shaft.

1027
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,740
A healthy few inches.

1028
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,900
Nothing wrong with that.

1029
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,780
Nothing wrong with that.

1030
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,820
That's gonna put my mind at ease, and you're gonna look good in the picture.

1031
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,860
You're gonna look good doing that.

1032
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:19,380
I also want to take a moment to say hi to our frequent listener, our grandmother, Nani.

1033
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,820
Oh, hi, Nani.

1034
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,420
Certainly enjoyed your visit this weekend, and I hope you got back to Florida safely.

1035
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:32,820
You'll find this special cut down version episode of this episode that we sent to you

1036
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,180
through Hotmail so that you can listen to it,

1037
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,740
and you won't hear all the stuff we said about dick tips and shafts.

1038
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,100
You're welcome.

1039
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,940
You're welcome. I love you.

1040
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,780
We make her a special Nani-friendly version every week.

1041
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,220
It is four and a half minutes long.

1042
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,260
We get Diplo and Cascade in the mix, and they do a remix version of us.

1043
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,220
Our Nani loves one thing, and that's for us to be chopped and screwed.

1044
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,980
Chopped and screwed, the Nani Club mix.

1045
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,980
Uh, can you read me a Yahoo, please?

1046
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,480
Sure.

1047
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:13,320
Um, I forgot about this one.

1048
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,480
This one was sent in by Golly and Yali.

1049
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,280
Thank you, Golly.

1050
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Vampire Knight Fan.

1051
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:35,960
It asks, why did so many critics not like Without a Paddle?

1052
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,160
I mean, it was a good movie, had action, was really funny,

1053
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,640
and when I watched the movie, I was never bored.

1054
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,400
Was it really that bad?

1055
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,800
And if you don't know why critics didn't like it,

1056
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,200
then can you tell me what you think of the movie?

1057
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,240
Why did those Philistines not appreciate the beauty of Without a Paddle?

1058
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,320
All right, just a real quick, uh, I know we make a lot of references here that people don't get,

1059
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,000
and you would be excused for not being on board with this one.

1060
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,080
This stars, uh, Matt Lillard.

1061
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,600
Let's see, Matt Lillard.

1062
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,560
Dax Shepard.

1063
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,520
Dax Shepard.

1064
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,480
That's from memory.

1065
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,040
Seth Green.

1066
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,680
And Seth Green in one goddamn movie.

1067
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,960
I shit you not.

1068
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,560
And the three of these, these bros, these buddies are,

1069
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,840
these bros, these buddies are going on a camping expedition?

1070
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,120
I think they're mourning the passing of one of their friends by partying in the woods.

1071
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,760
Yeah, that's it.

1072
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,880
Let me, uh, to the Google.

1073
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,720
Yeah, uh, uh, so that's, that's, they reunite for the funeral of a childhood friend,

1074
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,080
and they start looking for treasure?

1075
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:35,960
Yeah?

1076
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,800
And they get somehow, they're criminals, they're dangerous criminals that get mixed up in the,

1077
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,320
get mixed up.

1078
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,360
The Apple Dumbling Gang is also looking for the treasure.

1079
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,560
Yeah, they're on a race to...

1080
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,600
Here's all I'm saying.

1081
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,960
Budget, 19 mil, gross, 58 mil in the USA alone.

1082
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,840
So sorry, haters.

1083
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,200
Hey, haters, what do you think about that?

1084
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,400
Oh, you gave it-

1085
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,040
Sorry, haters.

1086
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,840
You gave it no stars, Mr. Ebert?

1087
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,520
Well, guess what?

1088
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,600
It's got three, it's got three stars.

1089
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,760
Dax Shepard, Seth Green, and Matt Lillard.

1090
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,880
And 58 million dollars.

1091
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,680
And it won the Oscar for surprising as gross.

1092
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,560
That's amazing.

1093
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,840
58 million dollars?

1094
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,480
In the USA alone.

1095
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,360
We are dumb assholes.

1096
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:20,920
We don't deserve-

1097
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,000
And that's why they made Without a Paddle 2.

1098
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,360
And Scott Adzit is in it.

1099
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,240
Oh, is he?

1100
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,040
From 30 Rock.

1101
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,540
Oh.

1102
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,920
It's, it's a great movie.

1103
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,960
He's, Scott Adzit is in the film, credited as Greasy Man.

1104
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:42,600
Which, I love Scott Adzit, but that's, that's actually sounds pretty accurate.

1105
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,680
It actually has a, there was a person in the movie who was literally named Morgan Reese Fairhead.

1106
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,200
That is not a good name.

1107
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,560
Listen.

1108
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,400
How long was this movie?

1109
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,840
How long do people sit in the theater and nod and chuckle along?

1110
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,880
95 minutes.

1111
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,680
That sounds about right.

1112
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,120
The year was, yeah, it was, listen, we're, it was 2004.

1113
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,640
We're still trying to get over 9-11.

1114
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,600
You gotta cut us some slack.

1115
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,240
Yahoo Answers.

1116
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,880
I don't know how to tell you this, but the film wasn't very good.

1117
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,880
And so the critics said mean things about it because that her job, their job is to say,

1118
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,480
hey, this film wasn't very good.

1119
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,360
And here's how you know.

1120
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,560
It had Dax Shepard in it.

1121
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,240
Yeah.

1122
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,440
Well, see, I think it breaks down.

1123
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,480
Everyone individually has been involved with a quality production.

1124
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,520
You tell me what Dax Shepard was good in right now and I will eat my own head off my neck.

1125
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,880
Get ready to say goodbye to your head because he was amazing in Idiocracy.

1126
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,720
Sorry, Griffin.

1127
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:43,960
Fuck.

1128
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,320
Sorry.

1129
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,360
I can only reach for my lips.

1130
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,200
Seth Green was in Buffy and Matthew Lillard was in The Descendants.

1131
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,320
So what the fuck?

1132
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:01,960
I don't know.

1133
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,440
I don't know.

1134
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,360
You get these three together and it's a cinematic Holocaust.

1135
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,880
Sometimes they do okay.

1136
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,920
That was actually the tagline of the movie.

1137
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,720
Without a paddle, a cinematic Holocaust.

1138
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,000
On the section on IMDb where it says stars, Matthew Lillard, Seth Green, Dax Shepard.

1139
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,560
Uh, if you mouse over the word stars, there's actually a picture of Tom Hanks farting.

1140
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,920
It's kind of a weird commentary on that.

1141
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,880
Oh, my God.

1142
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,440
Um, so, uh, it seemed, I don't know why people didn't like it so much.

1143
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,080
Um, were there any responses from, oh God, were there some responses from defenders of

1144
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,720
the film?

1145
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,600
I can only dream.

1146
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,240
I mean, there's just some shit.

1147
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,760
Hey guys, Seth Green here.

1148
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,800
I thought it was great.

1149
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,880
Because critics can't put bias into it.

1150
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,280
They look at it like you would look at a short story if you were analyzing it.

1151
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,840
They look at things we don't really concern about like cinematography, speech, camera

1152
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,080
angles, et cetera, script, especially.

1153
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,800
But I agree.

1154
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,760
Most good movies get negative to mixed reviews.

1155
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,680
Hey, no, they don't.

1156
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,240
Did they say one of the things that critics pick on that they shouldn't is script?

1157
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,840
They actually said speech.

1158
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,760
So, Matthew Lillard, I have to say your one, your line delivery in the scene where the

1159
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:36,200
canoe flipped and all of Seth Green's weed got wet and he said, oh, my dank herb is ruined.

1160
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,520
I was not convinced.

1161
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,320
No stars.

1162
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,880
Um, I don't mean to be elitist here, but cinematography is basically what makes a movie a

1163
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,360
movie.

1164
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,680
Yeah.

1165
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,640
So it's a pretty big deal.

1166
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,320
Because if it wasn't that, it would be a book.

1167
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,840
On tape, and then you'd have to hear Seth Green said, oh, yes, you soaked my gansh.

1168
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,880
What?

1169
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,400
What?

1170
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,200
I have two reviews for you.

1171
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,040
I'd like to read without a paddle.

1172
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:15,720
The first comes to us from John J Puccio from movie Metropolis says, maybe the filmmakers

1173
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,600
should have called this picture without a laugh.

1174
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,560
That is funny.

1175
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,560
Without a laugh, that is from his review of the film.

1176
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,400
Just below, we have another review.

1177
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,320
I kept looking and hoping for a laugh that never came.

1178
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,880
John J Puccio without a paddle, Blu-ray edition.

1179
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:41,960
So this fucking hero cracks open the Blu-ray and thinks maybe this time the Yahoo Answers

1180
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,440
user saw something I didn't.

1181
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:51,720
And maybe on the Blu-ray I can see that thread, but no, but he did go back to give it another

1182
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,200
shot.

1183
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,680
So don't say that he doesn't know his business because he most certainly does.

1184
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:02,840
So I found a copy of the without a paddle full script transcription on the Internet

1185
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:08,600
and I'll be honest, I spent the last minute or so searching for words like toot just to

1186
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,000
see if like Matthew Lillard toots as italicized action.

1187
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,320
Matthew Lillard toots as a bear smokes weed nearby.

1188
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,640
And the bear says, man, this dank is wet.

1189
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,000
Then Danny DeVito appears for a brief uncredited cameo as the bear.

1190
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,120
I really want to watch this movie right now.

1191
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah, I know.

1192
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,800
I pretty much want to it has become my new Inspector Gadget tube, my new white whale.

1193
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,320
I've got to see it and watch it.

1194
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,240
We need to start having my brother, my brother, me viewing parties where we invite a bunch

1195
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,560
of people.

1196
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,320
God damn it.

1197
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,680
OK, Rotten Tomatoes.

1198
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,760
The percentage of positive reviews that it received from critics is 14 percent.

1199
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,760
The number of positive reviews it received from the audience that watched it, 73 percent.

1200
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,240
Whoa, we are every 99 percent, by which I mean, 73 percent.

1201
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,840
That is this is how I'd like to point out that I'm sorry.

1202
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,040
I'm math don't lie.

1203
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,960
What they've said there is that that 14 percent of critics that when like the audience will

1204
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,280
love this, they were right.

1205
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,440
Like they called it.

1206
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,520
Yeah, they I mean, 14 percent of critics were I mean, is that is that true?

1207
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,320
I mean, is that accurate?

1208
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,840
Like 40 percent of critics or were somehow more have their finger on their Hollywood

1209
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,120
elite there.

1210
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:42,440
They are New York liberals and they are tearing our country apart and they are raiding our

1211
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,160
Doc Shepherd movies unfairly and they are a cancer on the organ of this country.

1212
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,160
That is American made cinema.

1213
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,520
That's just where I'm at is all those things I just said.

1214
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,920
Rich Klein says looks like another gross out farce, but it's actually a genuinely engaging

1215
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,600
comic adventure.

1216
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,400
Wow.

1217
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,960
Is it is it any of those things?

1218
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,680
And my brother, Dax Shepard, was awesome in it.

1219
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,120
Oh, my God.

1220
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,600
Oh, my God.

1221
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh, my God.

1222
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,880
This is from Vince Koehler and entertainment spectrum yet another one of the few critics

1223
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,240
that really had his finger on the pulse enough to know that America would love this movie.

1224
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,280
These guys get in a way over their heads stuck in the wilderness.

1225
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,720
The cover, the fucking poster is them standing in the water and the water is over their heads.

1226
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,240
This dude didn't watch the movie.

1227
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,520
He just looked at the poster.

1228
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,160
Now you can tell he watched the movie because his next sentence is the characters are developed.

1229
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,920
So the audience cares for the guys.

1230
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,000
The characters laugh when funny things happen and cry when it is sad.

1231
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,040
Amy Biancolli says it's a successfully infantile new spin on Deliverance.

1232
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,280
What the fuck do you laugh at?

1233
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Like, what do you think is hysterical?

1234
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:02,680
I hear the original cut of the script was Matt Lillard and Dax and is it cool if I just

1235
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,240
call him Dax?

1236
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:03,800
I don't know.

1237
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,360
I don't know.

1238
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:04,920
I don't know.

1239
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,400
I don't know.

1240
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,960
I don't know.

1241
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,440
I don't know.

1242
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:06,920
I don't know.

1243
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,480
I don't know.

1244
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,040
I don't know.

1245
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,680
I don't know.

1246
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,240
I don't know.

1247
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:09,720
I don't know.

1248
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,280
I don't know.

1249
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,160
Is it cool if I just call him Dax?

1250
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,560
Because I'm pretty sure everybody knows who I'm talking about when I just say Dax.

1251
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:13,800
Sure.

1252
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,040
Yeah.

1253
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,840
Everybody knows Dax.

1254
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:21,720
So Matt Lillard, Dax, and Seth Green go river rafting to have secret gay sex with each other.

1255
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,560
It's called With a Paddle was the original title.

1256
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:33,000
They changed it because they didn't think loose anal play would freak some people out.

1257
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,280
So Americans with your pretension and conventional attitudes towards loose anal play.

1258
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,840
I bet you that if that shit had included loose anal play, then guess what?

1259
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,520
That 17% would have been closer to 80, 82.

1260
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,440
It would have gotten a certified fresh sticker.

1261
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:49,880
Yep.

1262
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,280
Think about it.

1263
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:50,680
How about it?

1264
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,480
Think about that.

1265
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,080
How about it Without a Paddle 2?

1266
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,880
There's already Without a Paddle 2 called Without a Paddle Nature's Calling that I'm

1267
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,520
reading about right now.

1268
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,440
How about it Without a Paddle 3?

1269
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,120
Grin and-

1270
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,000
Without a Paddle 3D.

1271
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,880
Grin and bear it.

1272
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,040
And then, but there's this, there's a bear, but also it's a talking about sodomy, I guess.

1273
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,360
There's sodomy and also bears there.

1274
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,160
Dax Shepard's back doing his thing.

1275
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,320
Oh my God.

1276
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:17,880
Oh my God.

1277
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,080
There are two reviews.

1278
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,880
Still reading them.

1279
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Without a Paddle Nature's Calling.

1280
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:30,120
One of them is from John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis back for round three.

1281
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:40,440
I want this to spiral into a giant tribe about like the consciousness of America.

1282
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,240
We are the paddle.

1283
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,840
He just wants to understand.

1284
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,960
The paddle is all of us.

1285
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,920
We are the river of life that flows through Dax Shepard.

1286
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:57,000
And in doing so, we absorbed our own Dax Shepard and each of us are Dax and we are no Dax and

1287
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,040
we love Dax, but in the end, we die with him.

1288
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,760
Dax is all.

1289
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,000
Dax is all.

1290
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:09,560
When it finally comes out of like the third one comes direct to Game Boy.

1291
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,360
Now I get it.

1292
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,520
Press B to drop your weed in the river.

1293
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,800
Oh, when the third prequel comes out.

1294
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,200
Yeah.

1295
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,120
Then it ties the other two together.

1296
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,880
Without a battle, with a battle.

1297
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,480
The third triumvirate, The Legend of Carly's Gold.

1298
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,360
Without a battle three, try not to lose this battle.

1299
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,240
Seriously, boys.

1300
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:41,160
John's snippet is clearly the words frivolous and scatterbrained are in play here.

1301
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,760
When you have been loved him in there when they were assigning the review for

1302
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,360
Without a Paddle, Nature's Calling.

1303
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,080
No, guys, I got.

1304
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,440
Hey, Pooch, you're pretty much an expert on this, right?

1305
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:52,760
Please.

1306
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,200
Yeah, I got this, guys.

1307
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:01,240
This is my possibility that Poochiano was the only person who saw this movie,

1308
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,560
but he paid 58 million dollars to do so.

1309
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,880
He's a little steep, but I got to find out how these characters are developed

1310
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,480
because I already really like him.

1311
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,960
He's seen it at least twice.

1312
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:18,040
By the way, Without a Paddle, Nature's Calling, 22% of the audience enjoyed that.

1313
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,320
It's a pretty stark drop. So we are growing as a country.

1314
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,180
Wow.

1315
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,400
This has been our Without a Paddle fancast, my brother, my brother, and me.

1316
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,600
Thank you again for hanging out with us.

1317
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,320
If you can take a second this week and you say,

1318
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,440
this show is free, I love it, I wish I could pay for it.

1319
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,920
Well, what you can do is tell somebody you know to listen.

1320
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,440
You give them a link to our sampler, bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

1321
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,320
And you send them to that, it's 14 minutes of YouTube gold.

1322
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,040
And here's how this pyramid scheme works.

1323
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,360
You tell them it costs a dollar to listen to, payable directly to you.

1324
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:04,600
Right.

1325
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,920
That's how you make the money.

1326
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,600
We get the ears, you get the cash, it works out for everybody.

1327
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:19,960
Also, you can follow us on Twitter, we're at mbmbam in the common parlance.

1328
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,720
And if you could also tweet about the show this week,

1329
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:29,400
maybe throw a link to the sampler up and then use the mbmbam hashtag.

1330
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:38,280
Like so many people like DJ Pizzazz, Dirty Mustard, Kyle Mac 13,

1331
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,200
Andy Talks A Lot, Dylan Duarte, Not Brandon Crane, Parsip Zilla,

1332
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,960
our old friend Crystal Whalen, Omnitarian, Captain Novoland, just started.

1333
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:57,000
Hopefully he's enjoying the show and everybody, thank you so much for tweeting about it.

1334
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And that's because that's the only way we really have to spread the show's influence.

1335
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,560
So it means a lot.

1336
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,440
Yeah, it means a lot. Make sure you go and check out AppleandKiwiComics.com

1337
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,920
and if you would like to either have us awkwardly talk about your business or website,

1338
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,200
or if you'd like us to awkwardly wish you or someone you love happy birthday or happy anniversary,

1339
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,880
you can go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

1340
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,720
and get a message on either our show or any one of the awesome MaximumFun.org shows.

1341
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,880
I want to thank John Rodgers. Can I do that?

1342
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,040
Yeah, be quick.

1343
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,600
Thanks to John Rodgers and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1344
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,800
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed, which is our theme song.

1345
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,480
Go buy it. I've told you to do it 100 times and I'm sure you've done it twice already

1346
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,440
because you respect my time and you know how valuable it is.

1347
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,520
And you know what's good for you.

1348
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,120
You know what's good for you. I'm not going to lie,

1349
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,880
I am reading the script without a paddle, have been doing it for a while.

1350
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,360
Still into it, still feeling it.

1351
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,280
It is incomprehensible.

1352
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,880
And go discuss Without a Paddle on our forums.

1353
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:13,320
Don't mention this episode, just start talking about Without a Paddle in the thread for this

1354
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:18,120
show and it will make people who do not listen to the show completely lose their goddamn minds.

1355
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,200
Swap stories, swap fanfic.

1356
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,120
Maybe I want this third movie to get made.

1357
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,960
I want to see how the epic trilogy comes to an end,

1358
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,520
or maybe just a 3D remake in theaters would be fun too.

1359
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,760
I want to see how this episode comes to an end.

1360
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,520
Yeah, me too.

1361
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,880
And it's with a question from the Yahoo answer service that Griffin's going to read to us

1362
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,040
to kind of just ease us into the week.

1363
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,040
Something to think about and we'll come back to next time.

1364
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,560
Sure. This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1365
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,200
Thank you, Jacob.

1366
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,280

Could Dragon Ball Z be possible in some way?

01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,720
Is that a Dragon Ball?

This is me, my brother, my brother and me.

Kiss your dads.

Swear on the lips.

Keep your heart, three stacks.
