1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. No wait.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
No wait, hold on.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,400
Hold up.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,880
I am your middle-est and now current oldest brother on the show.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,960
Oh shit. Justin is... Do you want to say your name?

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh, I'm Travis McElroy.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,200
Thank you. Justin's actually moving this week into a new house in beautiful Huntington,

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
West Virginia.

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,760
Into a new palatial estate?

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
It is. Joking aside, it's a massive place that he bought entirely with your Max Fund Drive

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
donations. Thanks, suckers.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
What you didn't know was Justin was going to use that money to buy a house. Gotcha.

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,320
A house is really the ultimate sort of production equipment you can have, isn't it?

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Because it's like where all your...

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
He's put up a lot of baffling.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah, it's where all your shit is. That house is 100% baffling. So yeah, Justin won't be

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,520
able to record this week because internet in Huntington is already pretty shoddy and

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,240
when relocation is involved, it's just not a possibility. So we got a best-of episode

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
for you this week. What do we call them? Bros better, bros best?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Bros better, bros better, bros best. I think.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
I don't think there's a third one in there. I think I suggested that as a goof for the

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,000
first one and I can't fucking believe it's still something we do whenever we run out

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
of material.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,600
But it is.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,040
So yeah, apologies for not having a new episode. I know it's kind of lame right after the Max

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Fund Drive, but Justin's got to move and we're actually under kind of a tight timetable anyway

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,760
because we are leaving here in just a few days to begin our first mini tour.

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,720
We're very excited about it.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Super psyched. Not our last mini tour. Maybe one day we'll do a mid-sized tour. Maybe we

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,840
can get up the gumption.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
And then we'll do a fun-sized tour.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,040
And then we'll do one show every other day for like a month.

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
That'll be our king-sized tour.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,760
Right, exactly. Yeah, we're going to Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago this week. We're very,

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,560
very excited.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,680
If you're going to those shows, make sure to send us questions to nbmbam at maximumfund.org.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
And make sure to put the city you'll be at in the subject line.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Yes, absolutely. We want to hear from you. If you've never been to a show before, we

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
do have some audience questions that we do. It's a lot of fun.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
We're really looking forward to seeing everybody in the Midwest.

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
If you're in the rest of the country, don't get too comfortable.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,880
We're coming at you, coming for you.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,880
Thanks again to everybody who donated to the Max Fund Drive.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,880
It was by far, it's almost ridiculous to say our most successful Max Fund Drive ever.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh my god, yes.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,480
I think it was all of the Max Fund Drive donors put together since we joined the network.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,600
It was ridiculous.

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,160
It's insane.

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,440
Thank you all so much.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,040
It's very flattering and humbling to say the least.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
So yeah, we got a best of episode for you.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,160
What's the episode range, Travis?

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
You're the one putting this one together.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,160
This is 62 to 71.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes, the golden age.

61
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,720
The golden era of my brother, my brother and me.

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,400
Cool.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Travis, you want to talk about your tat before we get going?

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,840
Yeah, I got my brother, my brother and me tattoo.

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,640
Did you cry?

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Did you cry a little bit?

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
I did not, Griffin.

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
Thank you very much.

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
But it did hurt like a mother.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
That's tender skin there on your ribs.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
Here's what most people don't know about getting a tattoo.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
Everyone's like, do tattoos hurt?

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
They don't at first.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
At first you're like, oh, okay, I can kind of get down.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
I understand what this feeling is.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
And then like two hours later, it's just like your same area

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,640
has just been pummeled by a needle for two hours.

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
A tender, a succulent area.

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,200
By the way, Travis, you really should have asked me

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,920
about the placement of the tattoo, the location,

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,960
because you know I have a claim on those sweet, sweet ribs.

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,480
Oh, I know, Griffin, but I made sure

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
that the meat was not damaged.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
How did that, Travis and I actually have a deal

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,640
where if we're ever stranded in a life or death situation,

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm allowed to eat his amazing, delicious ribs.

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,440
I have no idea where that spawned from,

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,920
but that's been going for a long time.

89
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
That's canon.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,600
That's canon.

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
That's canon, I wanna eat those sweet ribs.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,320
That's true.

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
Anyway, God, there's only two of us,

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
and we've only been going for a couple of minutes,

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
and we've already gone completely wildly off track.

96
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
If you wanna see a picture of that tattoo,

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
I'm gonna post it on our Facebook group.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
My brother and me, just search that on Facebook

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,680
and you'll find it.

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,400
It's really beautiful.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
It was designed for me by Diana Nock.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
You should go check out her webpage

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Intrepid Girlbot and read her comics

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
and see all of her amazing art.

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
I also wanted to say thank you to Graham

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
at the Purple Panther Tattoo in Los Angeles.

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,360
He did it for me and it was lovely and wonderful.

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
I highly recommend the shop.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Was it clean?

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Was it a clean shop?

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
It was so clean, so wonderful, so much fun.

112
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
Everyone there was super nice.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
That's my main concern is like every time

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
I see a tattoo shop in movies,

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,920
it's always like there's a drug dealer dying somewhere

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,600
and there's like knocked over cans of Mountain Dew.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
No Mountain Dew on the ground.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,720
It's very clean.

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
There's a skeleton.

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,080
There's like two skeletons.

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
All the Mountain Dew was upright.

122
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay, there's like three or four skeletons.

123
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
There were skeletons, but I think they were purely decorative.

124
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I also wanna say thank you to Travis Dixon,

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,800
my friend who went with me and filmed it all.

126
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,200
So I'm actually gonna have a video of me getting the tattoo

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,480
up on YouTube pretty soon.

128
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
Yeah, and what is the tattoo?

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
You haven't said it yet.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh, it's a beautiful-

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Are you looking at it right now to check?

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
You forgot what it was already?

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't, it's on my ribs.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
I can't see it.

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
It's a, I was trying to think of the word

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
cause I think the word is like raring,

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
but when like a horse is like raised up-

138
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,320
Rearing.

139
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah, rearing.

140
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
A rearing stallion with a banner middlest across it

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
and it's glorious and majestic.

142
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,320
So majestic.

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
Is it like mid dressage?

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, and it's also huge.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
It's about like seven inches high.

146
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,440
It's- Holy shit.

147
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
It's pretty big.

148
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,160
Okay, that we've prattled for long enough.

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
Thank you all for listening.

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Thank you all so much for donating.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,480
We'll be back in a little bit to tell you about

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,080
some of our wonderful sponsors.

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,880
So we will see on the other side.

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
So I recently moved into a apartment

155
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
with two other wonderful people

156
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,080
and trying to come up with a name to refer to it as.

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,600
The ranch, the old place, but nothing has really stuck.

158
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,720
My roommate, my roommate and me are getting desperate.

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Help us.

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,840
That's from Tom.

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
I think that the ranch and the old place

162
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,640
and like the commune and stuff.

163
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,520
That's pretty cool.

164
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,040
But let me pitch this.

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,360
What about like an old timey Southern plantation name?

166
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,160
Oh wow.

167
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
Like if you called it like Bell Rouge.

168
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
I love that.

169
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,920
This is my home La Croix.

170
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,840
Can we just name the house a person's name

171
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
and then have it sort of be a character in their story?

172
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Like this is Steve the house?

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,760
This is Dennis.

174
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,040
This is my house Dennis.

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,120
It's very spacious.

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,760
I live in here.

177
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
And then you pretend like it's like haunted

178
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,320
and you talk to it and like Dennis, it's cold in here.

179
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
Wait, is Dennis your butler?

180
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,400
Well, it's more like a house spirit.

181
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Dennis, your spirit has your ectoplasm has given me a chill.

182
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
How can you ever move though?

183
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Yeah, you leave Dennis behind.

184
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Gotta burn it down.

185
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
Dennis, as with all friendships,

186
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,560
when you have to leave one of your friends,

187
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,360
you must kill them.

188
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
If I can't have you know, I can't Dennis.

189
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
Can they name it Scott Bakkila?

190
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Can they name the house Scott Bakkila?

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,520
This is my house America's treasure Scott Bakkila.

192
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
I live in him.

193
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Hold on.

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
I live inside Scott Bakkila.

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Can we take it to the next level?

196
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,880
Okay.

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Can the three of you, assuming you're not on a long lease

198
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,520
that you would be penalized for leaving,

199
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,920
can you just go live inside of Scott Bakkila?

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,400
Like inner space style?

201
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Like inner space style, live in his guts.

202
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,040
Are you saying they need to invent shrinking technology?

203
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,240
Shrinking technology.

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,040
Where do you live?

205
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Just send that letter straight to Scott.

206
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Just P.O. Box Scott.

207
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
I've attached some notes and stuff to his eyeballs

208
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
so I can read it too.

209
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't read my mail Scott.

210
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,160
That's weird.

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
All these letters just keep getting mailed to me

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
but it just says Scott on it.

213
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh, that's mine.

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
Just eat the letter.

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,640
I'll get it.

216
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
If I could control Scott Bakkila's body from the inside

217
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
starting inner space, quantum leap to day one.

218
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,160
You guys don't even know.

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,880
Leaped again.

220
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
Leaped again.

221
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,800
Here I go.

222
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
Oh boy, here I go again.

223
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Tiny people in my body making me make this poor decision.

224
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,960
Scott Bakkila's manager would get a call

225
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
and he said, hi, is this a manager?

226
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,740
Yes.

227
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
This is definitely Scott Bakkila.

228
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
These are definitely aren't people inside of Scott Bakkila.

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,520
So wait, wait, wait.

230
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
This is gone from living in Scott Bakkila

231
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,000
to controlling it like Meet Dave style.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Yeah.

233
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,360
Like you're inside Scott Bakkila's head piloting him.

234
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,160
That's what we're at Travis, keep up.

235
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,660
Exactly.

236
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
That's exactly the situation.

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Can you put me on a TV show?

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,500
What kind?

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
Quantum Leap is pretty good.

240
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
You know how we've been itching to start on Quantum Leap

241
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
to the sequel?

242
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
To the sequel to a TV show?

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
That thing that, of course, people do all the time.

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,400
If they're bringing back Dallas, can't they bring back-

245
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,520
I mean, they're bringing back-

246
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm willing to bet they wouldn't call it Quantum Leap 2.

247
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
I think they could just call it Quantum Leap.

248
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
Quantum Leap colon some more.

249
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,400
As everyone knows, he took a brief sabbatical

250
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,360
and never returned home.

251
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,640
He's still out there leaping.

252
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,520
He is.

253
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,120
That show had a very ambiguous ending.

254
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm saying it's up to us to shrink ourselves lip and Scott Bakkila's body

255
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,960
and control him to create Quantum Leap 2.

256
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,600
Still leaping.

257
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Yep.

258
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,920
Leaped again.

259
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
How much money?

260
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
How much dollar do you want me to push for, Scott?

261
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Just the regular amount.

262
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
However much I normally get from shows.

263
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,400
Can we three times that money?

264
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,720
Can we triple it and then split it with your-

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,760
And then shrink it.

266
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
I got a lot of Minnie Mouse to feed.

267
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
I have Minnie Mouse to feed.

268
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
I mean, by which I mean tiny mouths that live inside me.

269
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
Can we make Scott Bakkila giant so that-

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Okay, seriously, not shrink down.

271
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,160
We just blow up Scott Bakkila.

272
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh my God, you guys have just set up a reality

273
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,080
where we can have a battle between giant Scott Bakkila

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
and giant Gawdaria.

275
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
Waging a war.

276
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Laser shooting out of his eyes.

277
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,400
He's leaping.

278
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Although I don't know why he would have laser technology.

279
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,960
He's just big Scott Bakkila.

280
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,520
Well, you know.

281
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,840
Bigger.

282
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,320
Why not?

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
I mean, if you're gonna shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
Don't limit yourself here.

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
We gotta dream big.

286
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,200
So we're all gonna go to Scott Bakkila, get inside him at once,

287
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,840
and what if we just gave Scott Bakkila the antibodies to fight Gawdaria

288
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,480
and then you would live inside him and be cured?

289
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,760
Oh, okay.

290
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
So he's like an incubator.

291
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
He's like a water slide, is what you're saying.

292
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
Like every person on Earth would have to go through Scott Bakkila's body

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,840
and then they would be free of diseases?

294
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
I don't understand what you're saying.

295
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah, Scott Bakkila needs to eat everybody, is what I'm telling you.

296
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,880
Giant Scott Bakkila, not regular Scott Bakkila.

297
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,680
So to answer your question about what to name your apartment,

298
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,080
Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
Glad that we could help with that one.

300
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,160
No, giant Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

301
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
Sorry, I meant to say giant Scott Bakkila.

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,000
If regular Scott Bakkila eats people, he's Hamillector.

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,680
Oh, and so then he absorbs all the Gawdaria

304
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,840
and then flies into space and explodes,

305
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,320
saving everyone on Earth but sacrificing himself.

306
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,640
This rain is really weird.

307
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,440
It smells like Scott Bakkila and Gawdaria in rain form.

308
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Why did we come out today?

309
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
I share Travis's Netflix account.

310
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
I have it hooked up to my PS3

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
so I can use his account to watch movies,

312
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
and the recommendations that pop up

313
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
are probably my favorite thing on the planet.

314
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,240
Here's more movies like Earth Girls Are Easy.

315
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Thanks, dude.

316
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,840
Thanks, Netflix.

317
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,960
To be fair, the funny thing is I love really terrible 80s movies

318
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
and Griffin loves horror movies,

319
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
so the recommendations that they come up with

320
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
is some of the most twisted shit I've ever seen.

321
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,400
It usually just gives up.

322
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,480
It's like, fuck it, you get Kangaroo Jack.

323
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,880
Watch it.

324
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
I hate you guys.

325
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
You broke my computer brain.

326
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,080
I love those recommendations, though,

327
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
because it's like,

328
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
here's some movies like Earth Girls Are Easy.

329
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
Cocoon.

330
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, I'm not actually sure that that's...

331
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
2001 is Space Odyssey.

332
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Netflix, just because it has space in it,

333
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,760
that's not...

334
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
There's two different things.

335
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
And also, to be fair, real quick,

336
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
while we're talking to Netflix,

337
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
I've noticed Netflix that sometimes they'll say shit like,

338
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
recommendations, if you liked Earth Girls Are Easy,

339
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
check out Earth Girls Are Easy.

340
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
That's some weak-ass shit, Netflix.

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
Netflix, are you sure that I'll like that?

342
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
Oh, that reminds me.

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,640
Have you seen Earth Girls Are Easy?

344
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,520
I have, Netflix.

345
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,320
You know I have.

346
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
Netflix, I watched it on you.

347
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
I used you to watch it.

348
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
You know that.

349
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
You know this truth.

350
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Can we go see Earth Girls Are Easy?

351
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,560
We can't, because we just did seconds ago.

352
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
I got a theatrical cut.

353
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,360
That's the same one.

354
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
I watched that one with you.

355
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,600
You loved it.

356
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,960
This one has even more Jeff Goldblum sex scenes.

357
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,920
And he's furry in them.

358
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't know how much you like that.

359
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh, you like furry Jeff Goldblum sex movies?

360
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
Here's Earth Girls Are Easy.

361
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,000
Perfect.

362
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
Hey, have you seen Das Boot?

363
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,360
Let me start it up.

364
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,080
What the fuck?

365
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,680
This is Earth Girls Are Easy again.

366
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
You just changed the picture.

367
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
You changed the fuck line.

368
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
Actually, now that I've examined it here,

369
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,520
I can see where you've just hastily scribbled Das Boot in crayon.

370
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,000
I mean, the Earth Girls Are Easy box.

371
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,600
Just darkened everything so it looks like it's in a submarine.

372
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I was trying to watch the pianist,

373
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,840
but I see that you went ahead and you just loaded up Earth Girls Are Easy.

374
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,200
By the way, if someone makes an Earth Girls Are Easy sequel in a submarine,

375
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,560
like Earth Girls Are Easy and oh my god, there's so much water.

376
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Earth Girls Are Easy and deeply submerged.

377
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Like, I would watch that.

378
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,320
I would watch that movie, I think.

379
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
Like, who would be, okay, who would be the aliens?

380
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Like, before it was Damon Wayans, Jeff Goldblum, and Jim Carrey.

381
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
Who would be like-

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh, Christ.

383
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
That's such a power pack.

384
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
That's like the-

385
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,480
I mean, you gotta assume-

386
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
That's like the new Hollywood rap pack, right?

387
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,920
You gotta assume Dax Shepard weasels his way in there, right?

388
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,600
Gotta get two scoops of Dax.

389
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
Gotta get Dax up in there.

390
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
See, I think Jonah Hill's too big now.

391
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
Jonah, oh, he wouldn't fit in the submarine.

392
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,740
Idiot.

393
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,700
Asshole.

394
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,160
I think Dax Shepard, I think that DL Hughley could use a job.

395
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,080
I need one more.

396
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
And Jim Carrey.

397
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
And Jim Carrey.

398
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,040
This summer, Jim Carrey, Dax Shepard, and DL Hughley

399
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,440
learn that Earth girls are easy, and also underwater pretty deeply.

400
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,280
They learn how to steer submarines, and also how to please a woman.

401
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,840
Wearing a backup diaper.

402
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,760
Because who's that driving the submarine?

403
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,800
It's Carrot Top.

404
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
God, this is a good movie.

405
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,880
When is this coming out?

406
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
I really do want to see it.

407
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
What are you even saying?

408
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,680
Are you saying Little Brother is going through viral puberty?

409
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,480
What are you saying?

410
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,200
What are you saying?

411
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,520
Hey, Mike.

412
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

413
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Pass me my juice.

414
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm gonna watch some Yu-Gi-Oh.

415
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,760
You down?

416
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
You gotta check this Saturday morning lineup.

417
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,640
We got Yu-Gi-Oh, we got Phineas and Ferb, and SpongeBob.

418
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
It's fucking sick.

419
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
It's fucking killer.

420
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
I spilled Capri Sun on my jam jams.

421
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,580
Fuck.

422
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,260
My whole scene is fucked, Mike.

423
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,380
Hey, Mom, throw my jam jams in the dryer.

424
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,300
Got Capri on them again.

425
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,100
Fuck.

426
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,500
This wouldn't be so frustrating if I knew how to jerk it.

427
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,220
Fuck this.

428
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,860
Fuck everything.

429
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,140
I wish I was three again.

430
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,180
Shit was so easy back then.

431
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,380
I like your idea.

432
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:26,340
I like your idea that banks are lady zoos.

433
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,500
That's what they are.

434
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
They're lady zoos.

435
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
You go through the drive-through, you get to see a lady.

436
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,060
You pay your deposit, you pay your APR, and you get to see ladies in prison.

437
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,580
Anybody could use an automatic teller machine for anything.

438
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,940
You know why you don't?

439
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,540
It's because you're going to go see a lady in a prison, and you're going to think,

440
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,740
oh, I should ask her out.

441
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,860
You're going to treat yourself to a little midday alternate reality fantasy about this

442
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,180
girl.

443
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,620
But you're just stop it.

444
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,220
Just go use the teller machine.

445
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,380
Why do you want an extra interaction?

446
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,940
I don't get it.

447
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,940
I don't get it.

448
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,860
So I think somewhere in there, we've decided it's not a good idea to ask that.

449
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,780
I think we've decided that anybody in any service industry, you should not court.

450
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,580
Leave them alone.

451
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,140
They're working.

452
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,100
Leave them alone.

453
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,780
Can't you just leave them alone?

454
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,220
I'll tell you what.

455
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,580
Here's the message you're sending.

456
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,340
Let's talk about first impressions for a second.

457
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,220
You order a pizza.

458
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,940
So this person knows two things about you.

459
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,300
One, you pay for it.

460
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,660
And two, you don't cook.

461
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,900
So that's not a good start.

462
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,020
No, it's not a good start.

463
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,300
Plus, plus, plus, you have to decide this so quickly.

464
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,220
You know absolutely nothing about them.

465
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,020
No, nothing about them.

466
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,940
It's like mystery day.

467
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,700
You look at them for five seconds like, I have to make a split second decision.

468
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,260
And you do too.

469
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,100
That's what decides right now.

470
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,980
We're making a connection.

471
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,740
You guys don't believe in love at first sight?

472
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,380
No.

473
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Not when she's driving a shitty rusted out Dodge Dart and holding a pizza box.

474
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,540
Why can't you fall in love with a girl driving like you said?

475
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Chaz, you're throwing a lot of hate.

476
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,460
You're throwing a lot of hate this app.

477
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm just saying that you know nothing about her.

478
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,980
She knows nothing about you.

479
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,700
It's too on the spot.

480
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,660
I have built entire marriages out of less information than you like pizza and don't

481
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,100
like driving to get pizza.

482
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,980
You're down with Hawaiian.

483
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,580
That must mean you're mysterious, cultured, and you have a sophisticated ballot.

484
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,500
Can I appreciate the intermingling, the delicate dance of salty and sweet?

485
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:40,740
Yahoo!

486
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:49,460
Answer user Bunny asks, do ghosts see you when you are having sex or when you are using

487
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,020
the toilet?

488
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,260
I think my house is haunted and I don't mind, but I was thinking that if it was my dead

489
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,740
granddad or anyone else I know who has died, then it'd be embarrassing if they saw me naked

490
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,140
or doing things with my husband or on the toilet.

491
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,660
Hey, dummy.

492
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,300
Okay, here's the thing.

493
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,620
Let's play into the premise that your house is haunted with your granddad.

494
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,820
Do you think that in the ethereal plane he's really super duper worried about what you're

495
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,700
doing on the toilet?

496
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,580
Yeah, that'd be really weird of your grandpa.

497
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,180
Was your grandpa like a nasty freak?

498
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,700
Is that like something you do?

499
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
Like poke his head in ghost head style?

500
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,740
Like what's going on in here?

501
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Sorry, didn't realize.

502
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,260
I won't keep you.

503
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,500
If he was a nasty Gramps in real life, then I have no reason to believe he won't be a

504
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,260
nasty Gramps in the afterlife.

505
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,740
The idea of a ghost is that after they die, they had unfinished business.

506
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,300
If his unfinished business is to peep on you while you're doing it or hitting the toilet,

507
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,620
then-

508
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,900
If his unfinished business is your unfinished business, then-

509
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,980
I can't move on until I watch your deuce.

510
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,020
I can't move on until you make a movement.

511
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,660
I would watch people fuck all the time if I was a ghost, so.

512
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,380
Eat your ghost popcorn.

513
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,500
What is this question?

514
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,900
Is this-

515
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,700
Of course they fucking do.

516
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,820
Like, are ghosts not allowed to watch you fuck?

517
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,100
Like, if you have sex in a room with a ghost in, the ghost is like, oh, gotta go!

518
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,140
This is awkward.

519
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,180
Are they just colorblind?

520
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,620
Like they can't see naked people?

521
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,220
Don't be a child.

522
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,420
This is-

523
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,460
Don't be a child.

524
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,860
Of course ghosts are watching you have sex all the time.

525
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,780
You're not allowed to believe in ghosts and hauntings and also believe that ghosts aren't

526
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,540
gonna watch you fuck and use the bathroom, because of course they do.

527
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,980
The reason the rest of us are out here in fucking same town is because I-

528
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,900
That idea is too creepy.

529
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,460
I can't-

530
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,020
I can't even begin to believe that-

531
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,380
That there are not only ghosts, but they're watching me deuce.

532
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,580
You know why it's creepy?

533
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,980
Almost a trillion people have walked the earth.

534
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,740
Almost one-

535
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,900
Really let that number sink in.

536
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,100
A trill of people have walked the earth?

537
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,780
The space is gotta be-

538
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,660
We are just caught-

539
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,140
Like a flock of ghosts.

540
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,740
So what you're saying is, the chances that when I am shooting a duke, there is a ghost

541
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,260
not only watching me, but occupying the same space that I am.

542
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,380
I'm in you!

543
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,500
Under you!

544
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,260
You are shitting at a ghost.

545
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,740
You are not only having sex with your wife, you're having sex with like three to four ghosts

546
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,700
that are inhabiting the same space as your wife.

547
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,220
We need to deal with this astral infestation.

548
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,020
This is ridiculous.

549
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,500
Really bad.

550
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,740
Many of them have gone to hell.

551
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,460
Oh, okay.

552
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
For watching people use the bathroom.

553
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,540
That's the secret about ghosts.

554
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,180
That's the one rule of ghosts is that you get to walk the earth, but if you watch people

555
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,460
have sex or make a BM or if you actually see a penis or a boob, you go to hell instantly.

556
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,260
There is no appeal.

557
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,500
I am suggesting that we can really get rid of these trillion ghosts if we all just walk

558
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,380
around with our dicks out.

559
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,860
Bye ghosts.

560
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,500
What are you doing?

561
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,580
They'll say as I walk down the street with my dick out and I'll just say, ghost busted.

562
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,940
Busted makes me feel good.

563
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,060
Busted makes me feel good, which explains how fully erect I am.

564
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,220
Don't mind me.

565
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,860
What are you doing?

566
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,740
I'm killing ghosts.

567
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,180
Well.

568
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,060
Makes me feel good.

569
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,220
It's finally happened.

570
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,540
Finally happened.

571
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,620
Griffin's chasing ghosts around with his penis.

572
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,700
So did you guys hear Ray Parker Jr.

573
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
Got locked up for public exposure.

574
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,660
We got a button.

575
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,460
We got to get him out.

576
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,660
He's the only one who can stop.

577
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,500
There's a joke about me calling my penis slime right here.

578
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,220
Give me a second.

579
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,020
Okay, we'll just take a break.

580
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,260
Okay.

581
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,260
Is there anything really wrong with being a character, though?

582
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:51,300
Well, if you name any literary character such as anything from eat, pray, love to the goblet

583
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,940
of fire.

584
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,340
Okay.

585
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,140
I will.

586
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,580
I will impersonate.

587
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,380
Mystic pizza.

588
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,740
Mystic pizza.

589
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,020
Oh, there's some spooky pepperoni.

590
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,900
Pass the insight.

591
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:01,940
Okay.

592
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,260
Okay.

593
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,980
Sisterhood of the traveling pants.

594
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,740
Hey, come back here.

595
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,780
Hey, hey, hey, I'm all skin and undies down there.

596
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,580
Come on back.

597
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,140
I don't know how we can, how she can use this.

598
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,020
She can't just walk around without pants and say, hi, I'm sisterhood of the traveling pants

599
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,420
because then so I got any other.

600
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,980
You got any other characters for me or all mine are empowered female groups.

601
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,020
Divine secrets of the sisterhood, fried tomatoes.

602
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,820
This is all I got.

603
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,700
These are crunchy yet sour.

604
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,900
I just learned about growing up.

605
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,620
Beaches.

606
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,460
What?

607
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,220
Beaches and or moon struck.

608
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,060
Uh, beaches, uh, moon struck.

609
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,140
I have not seen, uh, beaches, uh, uh, women, you find wings.

610
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,540
That's all I know.

611
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,900
You got stomped.

612
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,860
That was not good.

613
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm not sure.

614
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,020
Beaches trivia.

615
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,260
Okay.

616
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,540
Was beaches a book though?

617
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,340
I have a literary mind.

618
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,540
I thought you were all into books.

619
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,820
Now you have a stake in them.

620
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,020
Um, it proves to me beaches was a book.

621
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,700
I have to believe that there is a book adaptation of the film beaches, and I have to believe

622
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:22,580
that I have won all the book prizes that books can win best book based on beaches.

623
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:31,940
And now the 1997 best book award goes to beaches.

624
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,500
The book of the movie with Bette Midler.

625
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,660
You can only read it once because once you get to the end, your tears have soaked the

626
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,620
book through.

627
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,500
Just throw it away.

628
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,860
Buy a new Beaches book.

629
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,300
Buy two Beaches book.

630
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,260
I need your money.

631
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,620
Mark Twain, come on up here and accept this award.

632
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,020
I'm glad he came out of retirement to write Beaches, the book of the movie with Bette

633
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,500
Midler.

634
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,300
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Mike Bernsteil.

635
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,860
Thank you, Mike.

636
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
It's a pretty cool name.

637
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,420
Huh?

638
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,380
Pretty cool name.

639
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,940
Yeah.

640
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,500
Yeah.

641
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,060
I like it.

642
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
You know what, now that you mention it, it is a pretty cool name.

643
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:17,700
It's by Yahoo Answers user PDFGhost, who says, what are some good ways to look cool at the

644
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,260
urinal?

645
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,420
I'm trying to seem cool at work when I'm at the urinal.

646
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,620
Lately, while I'm peeing, I've been putting my hands in my pockets.

647
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,780
I've thought about resting my elbow on the wall and putting my head against my hand, just kind of

648
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,340
chilling, acting like it's not even a big deal, and I'm peeing.

649
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,140
NBD.

650
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,500
Any other ideas?

651
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
It's not like I'm trying to hook up with any dudes.

652
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,420
I just want people to think, man, that's a chill dude.

653
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,300
And everyone has to go to the bathroom, so that's where you see the widest variety of

654
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,800
people.

655
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,060
Bring your office chair with you and just kind of recline.

656
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,580
Oh, god, yes.

657
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,260
Just roll in there like, what's up?

658
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,140
Chillin', chill dude.

659
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh, and go to the tiny kid's urinal, and just lean back in your chair and hit it.

660
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,900
It looks huge.

661
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,900
Can you have a Mai Tai in your hand?

662
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,020
I don't know how cool your office is, but if you can have a Mai Tai in your hand while

663
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,980
you pee from your chair into a child's urinal while your boss watches you.

664
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,340
If you can do it hands-free and put both hands up in a gesture that says, what the fuck,

665
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,860
it's summer, chill dude.

666
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,860
And maybe like hang ten.

667
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,100
Yeah.

668
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,220
If you can do some wall push-ups while you're doing it, like get that, get diesel.

669
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,420
Get pumped.

670
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,220
Is it too complicated to do a touchdown dance?

671
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,460
As you're, like when you're done or what?

672
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,580
Like as you're doing it.

673
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,820
Yeah, I mean, it seems like a premature celebration because you don't know how long it's gonna

674
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,740
go or if you're gonna go that dribble.

675
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,860
What if you do a bad job of it?

676
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,620
Um, can you plank?

677
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,860
Oh, you could if you had those like wall divider things and you just laid across them.

678
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,420
And you tucked your wormy in one of the toilets.

679
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,100
While you aim down.

680
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,940
While you planked on it and you peed straight down.

681
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,340
But if there are other people in that bathroom, I mean, if there are other people at the other

682
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,420
urinals that you're planking on, that's gonna be a scene.

683
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,500
That's gonna be a whole ordeal.

684
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,380
And what if they got one of those big pee troughs?

685
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,900
Oh, wait.

686
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,260
Nothing just laying in the trough.

687
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,060
That would be perfect.

688
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,460
I've seen some people, I've seen some people at a Cubs game that just go to sleep in that

689
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,100
trough.

690
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,140
Daddy, is he planking?

691
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,020
Like, no, son.

692
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
No, son, he's half dead.

693
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,180
That's, that's JB.

694
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,020
You gotta pee, pee around him.

695
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,820
Although, although if you would look cool, peeing on another guy is cool.

696
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,860
Who's the boss?

697
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,900
Who's the boss?

698
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,980
Oh, wait, you are the boss of this company.

699
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,740
I'll go clean out my desk.

700
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,980
Sorry about your desk.

701
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,900
Maybe just move your desk into the bathroom.

702
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,740
Yeah.

703
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,860
Don't pee in a urinal.

704
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,380
Take Dominion back over your urination.

705
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,300
Just pee in the middle of a conversation.

706
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,180
Pee in your pants.

707
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,980
I better go watch the show.

708
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,740
Hey, Bradley, can you hold on for just one second?

709
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,660
Okay, go on.

710
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,820
Can you pee in your pants and then put your pants in the urinal while everybody's watching?

711
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,420
And wash them in there like a little washing machine?

712
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,220
I'll get this later.

713
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,940
Or just leave them behind.

714
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
Yeah, I'll pick it up at five.

715
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,940
Hey, Jerry, how are things in accounts?

716
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,780
When Bradley Cooper took the Limitless Pill,

717
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,300
do you think he came up with the coolest way to ever use the urinal?

718
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,060
Can you just do what he does in that movie?

719
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,180
So you've seen the movie, right?

720
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,060
Have not seen it, but does he use a urinal at one point?

721
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,460
He uses-

722
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,820
He uses all the urinals.

723
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,660
Uh-huh, all of them at once.

724
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,700
Limitless, Limitless Pill gives you five dicks

725
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,020
that are very accurate for each one.

726
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,980
You know how human beings only use 20% of their dicks?

727
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,500
Bradley Cooper uses 100% of his five dicks.

728
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,820
He does 500% all the time.

729
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,100
That's what Limitless is all about.

730
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,340
I thought I-

731
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,300
Is that what it's about?

732
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,620
To be fair, if that's what it was about, it would have been a way better movie.

733
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Just a ring of dicks and never any ring of dicks around his-

734
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Like a Cthulhu.

735
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,940
Like, it's a very Cthulhu-esque situation.

736
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,340
Uh-huh.

737
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,740
So I guess those are some cool things you can do.

738
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,380
Can you flex?

739
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,460
Can you thumb wrestle the guy next to you?

740
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,740
There's so many options.

741
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,340
Can you thumb wrestle yourself?

742
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,300
You can scream at the top of your lungs.

743
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,900
Scream not again.

744
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,140
Or I finally got it.

745
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,380
Yeah.

746
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,340
I got it.

747
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,300
Can you open up a window and pee out the window?

748
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,780
Just like-

749
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,540
And put your arms up in a manner that says,

750
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,980
I don't fucking care, man.

751
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,020
I think that part's good.

752
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
I think that part is non-negotiable.

753
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,580
You gotta put your hands up.

754
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,180
It's gotta be the, like, fuck it.

755
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,340
Yeah.

756
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,460
Just peeing in.

757
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,780
And I do love dropping, like, pants and underwear.

758
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,500
Hey, by the way-

759
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,780
Oh, be a girl.

760
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,260
I think it's a pretty dope way to win at the urinal.

761
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,500
If you're a girl, I think this day is yours.

762
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,740
How-

763
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,860
Hey, Dave, check this out.

764
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,500
High five.

765
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,980
I got it.

766
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,820
You go to the stall and you sit down to pee,

767
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,580
but you leave the stall door open.

768
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,580
Oh, occupy.

769
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,220
Oh.

770
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,180
Oh.

771
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,580
No, don't worry.

772
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,300
What are you looking at?

773
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,260
Hey, we're all dudes.

774
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,860
Hey, all dudes here.

775
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,900
I'm just taking a break, taking a relaxer while I go.

776
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,580
This one's for me.

777
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,980
This one's-

778
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,300
This Tucker's for me.

779
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,420
Does anybody have an O Magazine I can peruse?

780
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,020
Got some good housekeeping in here.

781
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,060
You guys want to read?

782
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh, you can't read.

783
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,300
You're standing up, dummies.

784
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,660
You still use urinals?

785
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:45,220
What a joke.

786
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,740
All right, we're going to end this real quick.

787
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,820
We've got some sponsors for this week's episode,

788
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,260
and it's some of our favorites.

789
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah.

790
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,140
You could even call this a bros better bros best of sponsors.

791
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,140
I think that that would be accurate, Griffin.

792
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,060
I think that that is absolutely correct.

793
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,100
Our first sponsor this week, you know them, you love them.

794
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,180
It might be on your genitals right now.

795
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,900
Me undies.

796
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,980
Tabasco hot sauce.

797
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,620
What are you into?

798
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,900
Daisy sour cream.

799
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,700
What the fuck?

800
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,500
Why did you put that?

801
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,220
What are you doing?

802
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,140
Me undies.

803
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
It's you're going to wear underwear.

804
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,700
You're just going to do it unless you're one of those weird people

805
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,380
that's never wearing underwear.

806
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,900
In which case, like we get it.

807
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,140
You're spirited and earthy and stuff,

808
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,780
but put some underwear on because it feels better,

809
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,060
especially when the underwear you've got on is me undies.

810
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,860
And it's going to keep your balls from rubbing against your jeans.

811
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,940
I wore them all day today while I was doing yard work.

812
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,900
I was doing some very hot and heavy hedge trimming.

813
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,900
And I got back inside and my whole body was damp like a sponge cake.

814
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,700
And then I took my me undies off and it was like a mummy down there.

815
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,420
It was so dry.

816
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,260
It was weird.

817
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,260
I was mummy like in one zone and the rest of my area was sponge cake.

818
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,100
When I travel, I only wear me undies for that very

819
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,900
because, you know, you start you sit on a plane for like four hours.

820
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,060
Listen, we're getting into the nitty gritty right now,

821
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,500
but we're going to talk exclusively about genital moisture.

822
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,060
But I'm just saying like it keeps your zone very pleasant on long plane rides,

823
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,180
long car drives.

824
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,140
I'll tell you this, a me undies like pop up store,

825
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,100
you know, opened up in our neighborhood.

826
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,820
Oh my God.

827
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,620
And Teresa and I went down and each bought like three pairs.

828
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,500
So like I'm slowly turning over my whole underwear wardrobe to me undies.

829
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,300
That's a good call.

830
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,180
When I get to the bottom of my me undies in my lineup,

831
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,300
it's time for laundry.

832
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
I don't want to do anything but wear me undies.

833
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,180
Here's the thing.

834
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,540
Me undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear that fit great.

835
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,980
Don't ride up on you and literally pull moisture away.

836
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,580
Literally pull moisture away.

837
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,100
You can hear the sucking.

838
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,620
You can hear the sucking sound and it's I won't lie.

839
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,820
That part's a little bit upsetting.

840
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,100
I wish that they didn't make a loud, like it's hard to talk.

841
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,700
It's hard to have a conversation over them.

842
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,580
Like I can barely hear you.

843
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,540
But after a while, it just kind of like tunes out in the background,

844
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,220
you know, and you won't even notice it anymore.

845
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,340
I sleep to them actually now, the white noise of the sucking sound.

846
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
It really helps.

847
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,900
It's environmentally friendly.

848
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,140
The materials they use are sustainably sourced.

849
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,100
And also they look great.

850
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,900
Like that's the thing.

851
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,540
There's tons of different, tons of different patterns.

852
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,700
They're for men and women.

853
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,380
You can get matching pairs if like you and your loved one want to do that.

854
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,980
It's pretty cute, you guys.

855
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,660
Here's what I want you to do.

856
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,940
I want you to go to meundies.com.

857

because then you can look at pictures of people wearing underwear.

859

00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,660
But go to meundies.com slash my brother.

It's an amazing deal for some amazing underwear.

865
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,340
You have no reason not to do it.

866
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,540
Go get at it.

867
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
We also have another sponsor this week.

868
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,180
Can I tell you about them?

869
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,020
Oh, I mean, I already know about it, but sure.

870
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,540
I was more talking to my computer monitor, I guess.

871
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,380
Oh, like the general you, the royal you.

872
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,500
The ghost in the machine.

873
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,060
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

874
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,060

with step-by-step instructions on how to make each recipe.

879
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,660
Well, you're not making the recipe, are you?

880
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,220
You're making the food that the recipe details.

881
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,420
Well, and I'll tell you this,

882
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,660
Theresa and I love Blue Apron.

883
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,220
We pretty much, it's pretty much taking over our dinner schedule.

884
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,900
And I'll say this, man, it says it's for two people,

885
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,740
but you're going to end up with leftovers.

886
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,140
Yum.

887
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,700
And it's going to feed you for another two meals.

888
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,300
It's such a good deal.

889
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,020
Double food.

890
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,380
It's double food.

891
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,260
What do you party on?

892
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,940
Because they got chili blackened cod with epizote.

893
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,860
Fuck, I didn't say that right, probably.

894
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,380
No, I think you nailed it.

895
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,180
Chili blackened cod with epizote.

896
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,180
Grapefruit, avocado, and rice salad.

897
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,100
They got lamb meatball stew.

898
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,460
What's your jam?

899
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,460
Man, I tell you what we just made.

900
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,220
They were these, I'm trying to remember what the meat was.

901
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,500
I want to say it was like bison,

902
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,700
but it was burgers on pretzel buns with this cheddar sauce.

903
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,460
It was insane.

904
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,820
So good.

905
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,380
Like, this is the thing.

906
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,060
Here's the best thing about Blue Apron.

907
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,460
Not only do they send you the stuff, right?

908
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,620
So like, everything's right there to make the meal.

909
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,220
Like, you still get to feel the accomplishment

910
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,500
of making the meal.

911
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
They give you step-by-step instructions.

912
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,900
It's so clear.

913
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,300
It's so even if you know nothing about cooking,

914
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,540
they tell you everything you need to do to do it.

915
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,740
And then you're like, I made this awesome meal.

916
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,420
Look what I hath wrought.

917
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,220
And it really gives you this like very empowering feeling.

918
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,820
You can impress, you know, if you're trying to impress a date.

919
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,340
It's a pretty solid.

920
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,660
You feel like a food god.

921
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,100
You can check out this week's menu

922
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,500
and get your first two meals for free,

923
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,260
which is fucking bonkers,

924
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,460
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

925
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,740
It's such a good deal, people.

926
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,460
I'm a big fan.

927
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,820
Our sponsors tend to win me over pretty quickly.

928
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,860
And then I'm like, well, I'm just doing this from now on.

929
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,660
Like, Teresa and I pretty much only wear me undies

930
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,420
and eat Blue Apron.

931
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,460
In your undies.

932
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,260
In our undies.

933
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
But we can't get it on our undies.

934
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,820
Nope.

935
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,220
It stains.

936
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:29,220
Our next ad is for 199X at www.agamewithoutmechanics.com.

937
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,700
And then vote for it on Steam Greenlight.

938
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,580
199X is a lightly interactive adventure game

939
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,220
that explores the relationship between the player, you,

940
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,060
and Clara, the person you control.

941
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,100
It is funny, sad, and everything in between.

942
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,300
Catch the fever.

943
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,340
I love that tagline.

944
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,220
It seems so wildly incongruous with the game

945
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,020
that they're presenting.

946
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,300
It's like, catch and collect all of the Claras.

947
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,380
And then trade them with your friends on the playground.

948
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,100
Who can battle?

949
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,780
Who can level up the strongest, Clara?

950
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,260
Quick description for their website.

951
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,420
In 199X, you control Clara.

952
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,500
I think it's 1990X, like a year.

953
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,140
Oh, sure.

954
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,380
OK.

955
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,540
You control Clara.

956
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,500
That's the problem.

957
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,420
The doctors say she's delusional.

958
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,020
But you know that can't be true.

959
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,620
She doesn't seem to believe it either.

960
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,940
The two of you need to work together to find a cure.

961
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,940
That sounds pretty cool.

962
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,900
I'm going to check that out.

963
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,700
And you should too.

964
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
We've got another.

965
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,300
Can I control Bulbasaur instead?

966
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,740
Well, you can always control Bulbasaur.

967
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,580
Is that even an option in this video game?

968
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,940
Did they even consider that?

969
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,540
I haven't played through it yet, Griffin.

970
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,340
So I don't know.

971
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,060
But go to www.

972
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,620
Did they even consider Kengis Khan?

973
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,460
Go to www.agamewithoutmechanics.com and check it out.

974
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,180
One last thing.

975
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,220

Wareheit and esteemed academic Caitlin Sabold

as they discuss pop culture, film, television, celebrities,

981
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,660
actual real life, and everything in between

982
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,940
as they struggle to become Almost Famous.

983
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,580
Alex and Caitlin share outrageous personal anecdotes,

984
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,740
put a fresh spin on pop culture, and even

make some heartfelt social commentary,

986
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,660

We feel our life force waning with every unsubscription.

993
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,980
Speaking of Almost Famous, while I was getting my tattoo,

994
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,260
I took a break to walk around and get some blood flowing.

995
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,820
I stepped outside with my friend Travis.

996
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,740
And he was like, hey, look over there.

997
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,020
And it was Sam Rockwell and Joaquin Phoenix just hanging out

998
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,980
at a coffee shop.

999
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,780
Oh, man.

1000
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,620
To be a fly on that glass.

1001
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,860
Well, it was wonderful because I had my shirt half off,

1002
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,340
so the tattoo was still exposed, which also meant

1003
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,860
my gut was exposed.

1004
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,260
So Sam Rockwell looked over at me at one point,

1005
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,940
kind of registered I was there, and went back

1006
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,820
to his conversation.

1007
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,260
And I was like, oh, great.

1008
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,420
So if nothing else, I know Sam Rockwell,

1009
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,620
so I'm going to be your gut today.

1010
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,100
Yeah.

1011
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,700
Joaquin Phoenix unbuttoned his shirt

1012
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,180
and showed you his 14 horse tattoos.

1013
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,660
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,180
And he was like, oh, good luck, man.

1015
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,900
Good luck.

1016
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,620
Thanks, Joaquin.

1017
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,220
And he was like, do you want to be in my next movie?

1018
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,660
And I said, Joaquin, I'm flattered.

1019
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,940
And he said, it's cool, man.

1020
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
So Inherent Fights 2, look for it.

1021
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,820
Look for it.

1022
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,140
Keep walking the line some more.

1023
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,740
Run the line.

1024
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,660
A line even further.

1025
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,620
A line to remember.

1026
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,340
That was a lot of things, a lot of jokes

1027
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,140
that we're throwing at you.

1028
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,940
See, there is some new material in this episode.

1029
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
Fuck, we're going to have to put this best of episode

1030
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,540
in the next best of episode, Trav.

1031
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,500
Oh, remember that time when Sam Rockwell saw Trav as his gut?

1032
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,940
Classic bit.

1033
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah.

1034
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,340
Thank you all for listening again and for donating again.

1035
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,020
We're just going to keep thanking you for donating

1036
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,980
for the next year, probably, until the next Max Fund Drive.

1037
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,300
I hope that's OK.

1038
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,500
It's all going to bleed together.

1039
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,900
Back to the goofs.

1040
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,780
Everybody, I want complete silence.

1041
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,660
Griffin, you have to read the whole thing.

1042
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,180
Let's see how long we can go.

1043
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,980
OK.

1044
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh, man.

1045
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,780
This is Baka Otaku 30.

1046
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,220
Good start.

1047
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,420
Is there some music you can underlay here later

1048
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,460
when you're editing together?

1049
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,500
Something kind of nice.

1050
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,100
Yeah, I'll throw down some Norah Jones.

1051
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Yeah.

1052
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,440
That would be great, actually.

1053
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,280
Having been to my fair share of spanking parties,

1054
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,240
I'll happily answer this.

1055
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,720
Though more information can be found in an essay

1056
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,480
that I posted on my spanking blog months ago.

1057
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,800
The link to my blog can be found on my profile,

1058
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,040
though it'll take some digging to find the correct entry.

1059
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,400
Unless a party has a specific theme like teacher-student,

1060
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,720
most people will simply wear clothes that are comfortable

1061
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,440
and casual.

1062
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Spankers may tend to wear clothes that are more formal

1063
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,440
or authoritative.

1064
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:55,320
And spankies lean towards clothes that are loose fitting

1065
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,040
or easily removed,

1066
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,520
allowing faster access to bare their bottom.

1067
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,720
Skirts are common among female spankies,

1068
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,200
with pleated schoolgirl skirts being the most common.

1069
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,600
Some people will dress in roleplay, though,

1070
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,760
and there are some parties devoted entirely to roleplay.

1071
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,400
Yes, you may sit and observe if you don't feel like playing.

1072
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,040
No one is forced to play,

1073
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,440
and many parties have the attendees wear stickers

1074
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,560
that show the orientation for their night.

1075
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,000
Top, bottom, or switch.

1076
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,040
I just threw a can across the room because I was so like,

1077
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,560
yes, I gave blood today.

1078
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,720
This is a crazy sticker.

1079
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,680
And include a designation for observer or newbie.

1080
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,360
As Phil pointed out, you may be encouraged to play,

1081
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,480
but most people won't be pushy.

1082
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,080
If you're new, the best parties will give a new person

1083
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,920
a chance to feel comfortable before they start playing.

1084
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,040
Most parties do have an entrance fee

1085
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,880
or at least ask for a donation to cover costs

1086
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,720
or that the attendees bring a-

1087
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,360
What cost?

1088
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,720
Or that the attendees bring a-

1089
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,080
The aloe vera?

1090
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,880
Or that the attendees bring a covered dish to share.

1091
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,440
Who brought the fried kale?

1092
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,920
This is-

1093
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,400
Ow!

1094
00:43:59,400 --> 00:43:59,880
Fuck!

1095
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,380
Ow!

1096
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,060
Not yet, Steve!

1097
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,020
Jesus fuck!

1098
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,140
Look at my sticker!

1099
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,900
I'm an observer!

1100
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,020
Check my sticker!

1101
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,580
Jesus!

1102
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,100
I'm the caterer to this big party.

1103
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,420
God damn.

1104
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,460
I'm clearly dressed in a more authoritative manner.

1105
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,060
I am the swanger!

1106
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,740
I like to wear a trench coat to the parties

1107
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,340
and tell them that I'm the covered dish.

1108
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,780
The best parties also offer the most

1109
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,820
for the least amount of cash.

1110
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,540
From what I've heard, Shadow Lane costs far too much

1111
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,500
for what is available.

1112
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,420
And I went to a Crimson Moon party

1113
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,500
and can say that the same is true for all of them.

1114
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,020
Crimson Moon, fuck you.

1115
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,220
Fuck you, that's made up.

1116
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,740
The most bang for the buck-

1117
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,540
Oh, this is promising.

1118
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,540
The most bang for the buck, from my experience,

1119
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,860
is the Texas All-State Spanking Party

1120
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,540
as their entrance fees are always low

1121
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,500
yet the party is huge,

1122
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,980
particularly the years that it takes place in Dallas.

1123
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,020
Road trip.

1124
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,100
Griffin must go.

1125
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,020
I'm gonna shade down to a mustache.

1126
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,140
I'm gonna fucking show up to that.

1127
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,100
Oh, God.

1128
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,780
Larger parties take place in hotels and resorts.

1129
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,460
Smaller parties usually at private residences.

1130
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,460
I enjoy the seclusion of a cabin party.

1131
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,420
There's something alluring to me

1132
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,420
at the public nature of a hotel party.

1133
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,020
There are also icebreaker games

1134
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,020
to get everyone comfortable when a party starts

1135
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,140
so spanking can begin.

1136
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,780
Demos, vendors, contests, and special events.

1137
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,300
Hey, guys.

1138
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,900
Just really quick.

1139
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,540
I mean, I get-

1140
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,660
Um, like, what's the-

1141
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,380
What's the-

1142
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,300
Does it go trust falls, then low ropes activities,

1143
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
and then you fucking punish someone's-

1144
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,500
Just punish that ass.

1145
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,260
What's the core-

1146
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,140
What is the-

1147
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,180
Explain to me.

1148
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,540
You played the minister's cat.

1149
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,100
It's-

1150
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,060
No, it's name game, keep the balls in the air,

1151
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,460
and then paddle till bloody chumps.

1152
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,300
Just fucking wail on that ass.

1153
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,660
Punish that student, and then you go back to low ropes.

1154
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,300
Is it light as a feather, stiff as a board,

1155
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,020
and then cat and nine tails, or-

1156
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,220
I can never remember.

1157
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
See, I like to use spanking to break the ice

1158
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,420
before I do something uncomfortable.

1159
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,380
Like, hey, I'm Justin.

1160
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,740
Low ropes-

1161
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,940
Ask to borrow money or something.

1162
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,820
You want some Sprite?

1163
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,060
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

1164
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,380
Yeah.

1165
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,940
Okay.

1166
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,060
I'd like us to explore.

1167
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,180
This one was sent in by Terry Dutton.

1168
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,660
Thanks, Terry.

1169
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:13,980
It's by-

1170
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,060
Take that thing for Terry Dutton.

1171
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,620
Terry Dutton.

1172
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,540
Terry Dutton sent this in. Thank you.

1173
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,540
It's by a Yahoo Answers user, Morgan Gretman, who asks-

1174
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,820
Take that thing-

1175
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,860
It's Morgan Gretman.

1176
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,340
Morgan Gretman.

1177
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,460
Picking the perfect quote, opinions needed.

1178
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,660
Getting a tattoo at the end of the month, and-

1179
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,540
Oh, no.

1180
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,860
I thought I had the perfect saying picked out,

1181
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,860
but I've come across a few more that I just love.

1182
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,300
If I could have all of them put on, I would.

1183
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,460
Just need opinions on which one sounds slash would look best.

1184
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,780
I am getting a horse tattoo on my back.

1185
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,660
Uh-huh.

1186
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,060
Not sure if it will be a rearing horse or a galloping horse,

1187
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,380
but here are the quotes I can't pick from.

1188
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,940
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

1189
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,300
Uh-huh.

1190
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:58,780
Okay.

1191
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,340
So that's the first one.

1192
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,300
Not a quote.

1193
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,660
Not a quote at all.

1194
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,020
Two hearts, one passion.

1195
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,300
Nope.

1196
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,860
Okay.

1197
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,220
Hoofprints never fade.

1198
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,700
What?

1199
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,260
They not.

1200
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,020
They don't fade.

1201
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,460
They don't.

1202
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,180
Together.

1203
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,620
Scientifically proven.

1204
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,180
Wait, wait, wait.

1205
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,420
Okay.

1206
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,140
Go ahead, Griffin.

1207
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,060
Together as one.

1208
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,220
Wave.

1209
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,900
I was going to put this into the tattoo section,

1210
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
but who would know better than horse lovers themselves?

1211
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,820
I don't want any big long quotes or anything.

1212
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,740
Something small and simple, but gets to the point.

1213
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,220
That gets to the point of how I'm a crazy person.

1214
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,860
Is- wait, hold on.

1215
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,420
Two hoofprints, one passion.

1216
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,180
Two hearts, one passion, which I love.

1217
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,820
Like, what's- is the passion going?

1218
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,380
Like, just moving- moving forward quickly?

1219
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,660
Like, that's my thing.

1220
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,500
Also, what about that horse's second heart?

1221
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,020
Uh-huh.

1222
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,180
Yeah.

1223
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,060
Didn't think about that.

1224
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,300
Time works.

1225
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,820
Time works.

1226
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,460
What do you want to bet this person does not in any way own a horse?

1227
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,340
No, no horse.

1228
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,980
Really, they want to remind themselves to save up for it.

1229
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,460
And they think that this is sort of throwing their hat over the fence.

1230
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,980
Like, if you get this, you got to have a horse.

1231
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,340
People are going to think you're an asshole.

1232
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,100
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

1233
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,900
Fire.

1234
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,060
Hey, the way that you ride a horse is really bad if fire's involved in the equation.

1235
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,660
Maybe you leap through fire as you're going to rescue-

1236
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,860
Oh, I ride a-

1237
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,700
What shitty quotes did they have before that they heard these and went,

1238
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,900
oh no, that's way better.

1239
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,900
Now I'm up in the air.

1240
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,140
Do- uh, did anybody make any suggestions or anything?

1241
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,300
Uh, a lot of people are down with elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

1242
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,900
Yeah, it's very elegant.

1243
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,500
A rearing horse would be better.

1244
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,740
Um, I really like hoofprints never fade.

1245
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,180
But here are some you may like.

1246
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,500
Oh, Christ.

1247
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,060
In riding a horse, we borrow freedom.

1248
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,940
Do we know?

1249
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,220
If you mind if I, uh-

1250
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,180
Excuse me, horse.

1251
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:51,820
Can I get a cup of freedom?

1252
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,860
Can I just for a second?

1253
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,380
Let me- that freedom looks pretty neat.

1254
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,180
Can I just check it?

1255
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,260
Pardon me, neighbor.

1256
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,540
Can I get a cup of freedom?

1257
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,660
And the horse just looks back and says,

1258
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,260
you look with your eyes, not with your hands.

1259
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,340
Hey, I am bone dry on freedom.

1260
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,260
Can I just mount you for a second?

1261
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,940
And just a little-

1262
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,740
To ride a- to ride a-

1263
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,540
Alright, can I finish?

1264
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,620
To ride a horse is to ride the sky.

1265
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,740
No, the problem I have with these quotes

1266
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,500
is that they're objectively untrue.

1267
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,260
To ride a horse is to ride a horse.

1268
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,820
That's all you're doing.

1269
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,660
It's a galloping bundle of bones and meat

1270
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,100
and you're riding it and that's-

1271
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,220
Hoofprints do in fact fade pretty quickly.

1272
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,580
They barely even think.

1273
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,700
Like, what are you doing?

1274
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,780
My horse is made of clouds and fire

1275
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,220
and it sucks to be on it.

1276
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,580
It sucks to touch this horse.

1277
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,340
Horses lend us the wings we lack.

1278
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:48,780
What?

1279
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,780
You're making these up by yourself now.

1280
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,580
I'm not making these up

1281
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,340
because I'm not a fucking crazy person.

1282
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,220
Hey, everyone, quit borrowing shit from horses.

1283
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,260
Like, they're not good lenders.

1284
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,260
Neither a borrower or a lender or a horse me.

1285
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,220
That's my-

1286
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,940
To see what-

1287
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,220
For poor Richard.

1288
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,580
To see what man has made,

1289
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,620
one must get in a car.

1290
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,780
To see what God has made, one must get on a horse.

1291
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,140
No, to see what God has made, one must get in a horse.

1292
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,900
Nice work, Big G.

1293
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,260
You really grossed me out with all these horse parts.

1294
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,100
Big G, this is some sticky stuff.

1295
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,180
To be fair, I did think I was gonna freeze to death out here.

1296
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,900
Oh, thank you.

1297
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,940
Hey, Big G, I thought these were so bad on the outside.

1298
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,380
Hey, horse, can I borrow your-

1299
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,020
Well, your life.

1300
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,500
Uh, you may not get this one back for a while.

1301
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,140
Hey, horse, can I borrow your heat guts so I don't die?

1302
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,500
I need your guts heat to keep my bones warm.

1303
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,340
You're so good inside.

1304
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:45,660
Thank you.

1305
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,060
How about this quote?

1306
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,580
I'm gonna build a chair from your bones.

1307
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,100
How about this quote?

1308
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,700
To ride a horse is to borrow the entire Billy Joel discography.

1309
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,140
How did they figure?

1310
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,260
Because it makes as much sense as anything else.

1311
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,580
If your horse was-

1312
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,940
This is moving out, then I'm moving out.

1313
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,060
To fly a horse up in the sky is you are high.

1314
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,220
You are having a reaction to drugs.

1315
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,580
This is a different answer.

1316
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,860
If your horse is a racehorse,

1317
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,020
you were a great champion when you ran the ground shook.

1318
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,180
The sky opened and mere mortals parted,

1319
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,540
parted the way to victory.

1320
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,300
Where I'll meet you in the winner's circle,

1321
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,220
where I'll put a blanket of flowers on your back.

1322
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:25,580
Okay.

1323
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,340
So like a head to toe tattoo.

1324
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,820
Why were the mortals on the track?

1325
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,500
Get out of the way.

1326
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Get out of the way, there's horses.

1327
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,580
I feel like horses are kind of like,

1328
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,740
kind of like you were talking about with like cats and other house pets.

1329
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,700
Can we just leave horses alone?

1330
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,820
Can we just let them run free and beautiful?

1331
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,540
And not try to capture their essence with your back meat?

1332
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,700
It's gotta be rough because anyone can become a cat person just by buying a cat.

1333
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,100
You can buy a cat nowadays and take care of it for its entire lifespan for like 15 bucks.

1334
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,980
Like NBD.

1335
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,740
Horses, you really gotta go for that crazy.

1336
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,700
That's a lifestyle change.

1337
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,700
A crazy, crazy lifestyle change.

1338
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,500
You can't just casually take off for the weekend.

1339
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,220
To be fair, have you ever watched Animal Cops Houston?

1340
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,180
Yes.

1341
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,740
It doesn't always require a life.

1342
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,740
Sometimes you're like, I brought this horse, it's in my apartment now.

1343
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,580
Oh shit, I forgot I had that horse.

1344
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,940
What?

1345
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,580
There's a horse behind your barn, you haven't fed it in three weeks.

1346
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,460
Oh shit!

1347
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,180
Stop, fuck, I haven't gone in that guest room in a long time.

1348
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,940
Let's do a Yahoo answer question.

1349
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,100
This one was sent in by Pandapocalypse.

1350
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,860
Thanks, you.

1351
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,540
It's by Yahoo Answers user, I'm all yours.

1352
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:59,740
Who says, who asks, best places for sex in college?

1353
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,900
Just curious, because sometimes it's hard to find a good place.

1354
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,100
I try to do it in my dorms sometimes, but it's not easy because I would never want to

1355
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,820
do it in front of my roommate, that would look horrible on my part.

1356
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,380
So please, what places did you have sex while you were in college?

1357
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:12,780
Thanks.

1358
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,620
There's only one place to do it.

1359
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,500
Yeah, in your bed.

1360
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,900
Dean's couch.

1361
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,400
Whoa!

1362
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,140
Sorry, Dean, asshole.

1363
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,620
McElroy!

1364
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,460
I just had some sex on your couch, Dean.

1365
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,700
Hey, big man, I just had sex on your couch, Dean, asshole.

1366
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,900
Don't sit on the middle cushion anymore, that one's mine.

1367
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,500
Hey, I'm cleaning that with my own human musk, Dean.

1368
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,740
Unhuman musk is the name of my college jam band.

1369
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,740
See those, see those wavy lines coming off it?

1370
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,020
That's my sex steak.

1371
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,100
I hate you, Dean.

1372
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,860
I hate you so much, Dean.

1373
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,620
Why wouldn't you let me into your college?

1374
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,700
I'm not a student here.

1375
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,820
Here's a, here's a fun suggestion.

1376
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,100
I think it's fun for the whole family.

1377
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:19,180
Uh, dress your kid like a, um, a doggy and then put it in a cage and then leave it home and go get drunk.

1378
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,680
What?

1379
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,180
Party for Halloween, the spirits are out tonight.

1380
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,900
Me and mom going out and you're gonna be alright in your cage we made for you.

1381
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,660
Just put some candy in there and it'll be fine.

1382
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,620
Put some candy in the clothes hanger cage that we made for you.

1383
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,140
You just re-bend them, you just bend them into bars.

1384
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,020
Babies aren't strong.

1385
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,900
It won't take long.

1386
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,980
Just go out and get drunk with mom.

1387
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,020
You guys deserve it.

1388
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,980
You've earned the night off.

1389
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,020
It's 10 p.m.

1390
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,220
Do you know where your baby is?

1391
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,180
Yes, in a cage.

1392
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,220
He's in the baby dog.

1393
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,900
It's okay, he's like, he dressed up like a dog.

1394
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,540
He's a baby dog, that much the better.

1395
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,540
The kind of irreparable harm you've done to your relationship by arguing about costumes.

1396
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,740
You gotta get on a retreat and by retreat, I mean go to Shakey's and get you drunk.

1397
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,460
Make sure you take lots of pictures of that too so that when your kid turns 18 and kills

1398
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,660
everyone he knows, you can show those pictures to the news.

1399
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,020
Just throw some Alpo in the cage and go get your drunk.

1400
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,500
Get that drunk.

1401
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,340
Mr. Stevenson, I'm sorry I'm placing you under arrest.

1402
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,700
Your son was locked in a cage unsupervised.

1403
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,340
What the fuck?

1404
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,620
That's a dog.

1405
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,420
That's a dog.

1406
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,300
That is actually your child in a dog.

1407
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,540
Well, color me embarrassed, officer.

1408
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,740
Look at his nose.

1409
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,060
I have painted it brown like a dog's nose is brown.

1410
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,180
Officer, you are terrible at improv games.

1411
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,660
I, yeah, you're supposed to say yes.

1412
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,860
Yes, and.

1413
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,820
Yes, and.

1414
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,300
Yes, and my baby's a dog in a cage.

1415
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,700
Yes, and do you want some of this beer?

1416
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,620
I have extra because we have so much in us.

1417
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,700
Do you want a brewski?

1418
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,940
And we'll forget about this and also forget about the kid.

1419
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,700
He's fine for another hour or so.

1420
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,500
Let's go play some foosball.

1421
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,820
Let's go play, let's go foos it up, copper.

1422
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,220
And then it turns out that the cop is a baby dressed as a cop.

1423
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,700
Incepted.

1424
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,980
Baby police, you just got busted by the highest authority in the land.

1425
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:20,940
Baby police?

1426
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,340
Baby police is the highest authority in the land, sentient baby.

1427
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,020
We are under baby martial law.

1428
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,660
It's adorable and also restrictive.

1429
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,780
This is a baby police state.

1430
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,900
All TVs will watch Nick Jr.

1431
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,660
All things will go boring when you hit them.

1432
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,940
The cow says moo, you say nothing.

1433
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,620
I snap my fingers, you pull out a tit.

1434
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,580
This is baby law.

1435
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,180
We're out of things now.

1436
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,940
You know, I would watch a legal drama called Baby's Law, which is about a baby lawyer.

1437
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:04,220
Yeah, um, babies don't grow up to be adults because this is what you do.

1438
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,460
You think about baby anarchy.

1439
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,180
Which is adorable and terrifying at the same time.

1440
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,820
This one was sent in by Diego McKinney.

1441
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,980
I'm almost certain Justin just looked at it.

1442
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,540
It's by Yahoo!

1443
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,380
Answers user Garland Garcia who asks,

1444
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,260
is it legal to have sex with trees on your own property?

1445
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,100
Oh, oh my.

1446
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,340
Now the top answer is unless the tree can be seen by a passerby, it's not illegal.

1447
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,340
It's not as if there's a precedent to making it illegal.

1448
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,540
Despite the foolishness of the question, I've decided to address it seriously.

1449
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,900
And I appreciate that, John Lennon, which is your username.

1450
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,460
I don't think that that's accurate.

1451
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,100
No, yeah, sure.

1452
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,980
Here's what's terrifying about this question and why I decided to discuss it.

1453
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,140
Now by accurate, do you think I meant the answer or the fact that that is John Lennon?

1454
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,060
Or the fact that there's no precedent for this.

1455
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,340
I know, I agree with that part.

1456
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,460
I don't agree with that.

1457
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,820
That is John Lennon's ghost in the machine,

1458
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,700
but he's trapped in Yahoo!

1459
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,100
Answers forever and he just wants out so bad.

1460
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,780
Please let him on another site.

1461
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,260
He can't find his way out because it's a labyrinth.

1462
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,220
Take it from me.

1463
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,180
Our show is really about trying to find John Lennon's ghost hidden in Yahoo!

1464
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:15,340
Answers.

1465
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,100
Hidden in the hedge maze of terrible.

1466
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,540
This is the closest we've ever gotten.

1467
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,460
Is this gentleman's concern that a tree would report him to the police?

1468
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,380
For tree sex, for arboreal sex crimes?

1469
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,020
I don't think that that's a concern.

1470
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:36,220
Then what other law besides just being completely indecent in public,

1471
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,660
which is a law no matter what you're having sex with.

1472
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,620
Wrongo.

1473
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,500
Wrongo.

1474
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,380
Here's what I'm saying.

1475
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,500
Here's what's upsetting.

1476
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,940
If your fence is high enough.

1477
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,340
People could be fucking trees all the time.

1478
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,700
People could be fucking trees.

1479
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,460
They could have trees fucking them or each other.

1480
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,740
They could have grown the trees into a position that makes it look like they're having sex.

1481
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:03,180
I'm talking about branches and the bird holes and the fucking man, a nasty mess.

1482
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,060
A nasty mess.

1483
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,540
Is your concern that this is like rampant?

1484
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,060
I'm saying who knows?

1485
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,020
If you walk by a house with an eight foot fence,

1486
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,460
you just go ahead and assume that they are fucking something they should not be.

1487
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:14,620
Yeah.

1488
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,980
And spray paint on the fence.

1489
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,580
Tree fuckers go home.

1490
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:17,820
Yeah.

1491
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:23,020
And then just spend every night worrying about white ash beetles.

1492
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:25,980
Termites.

1493
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,580
I mean, I think people are stumping on the reg.

1494
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,780
You do?

1495
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,500
I think people are stumping right now somewhere in this world.

1496
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,460
That explains.

1497
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,340
Okay.

1498
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,940
Now I get the t-shirts.

1499
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,860
Stumpers have wood.

1500
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,660
Yeah.

1501
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:48,620
I get it now.

1502
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,500
It upsets me that we can find loopholes in the legal system to allow this kind of thing.

1503
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,700
Aren't laws supposed to keep you from doing really upsetting things?

1504
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,340
Isn't that the whole idea?

1505
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,660
I want the fucking law and order special victims unit to kick in the door and be like,

1506
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,700
hey, sex police.

1507
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,260
Don't move.

1508
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,740
Why do we even have special-

1509
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,580
Down on the floor, tree fucker.

1510
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:07,820
Yeah.

1511
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,500
Why even have the SVU if they're not going to stop shit like this from happening?

1512
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,860
Because psychically, it's in my brain.

1513
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,940
Like, there's a tiny, here's what you guys may not realize about my brain is just by

1514
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,900
saying that word, saying like tree fucker.

1515
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,940
Now in my brain, there's constantly a 24-7, till the day I die, a tiny man fucking a

1516
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,980
tiny tree in my brain.

1517
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,500
And he's just shouting, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker.

1518
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,820
Or tree man, penis, intercourse, intercourse, intercourse.

1519
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,300
Like, it can't be stopped.

1520
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,260
Please stop the noise.

1521
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,540
But you can't stop the noise.

1522
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,700
I want fucking iced tea to kick in the door and be like, stop SVU.

1523
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,140
And he can't do that in your brain.

1524
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,700
He's got to stop-

1525
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,020
Hold on.

1526
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,540
I got to incept him in there.

1527
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,100
Get him out.

1528
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,820
Brain iced tea.

1529
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,100
Griffin's eyeballs are bleeding.

1530
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,500
I think he incepted too much.

1531
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,220
Don't have sex with trees.

1532
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,820
Don't have sex with-

1533
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,780
If only to avoid the horrifying half-human, half-tree babies.

1534
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,100
And also the dick splinters.

1535
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,820
Stop it.

1536
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,020
Listen, you motherfuckers.

1537
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,700
Dryads have to come from somewhere.

1538
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,420
I want them to walk the earth, and this is the only way to get it done.

1539
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,460
It may not be pleasant.

1540
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,340
It may not even be-

1541
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,740
It's questionably illegal, but if we're going to have someone to bestow upon us,

1542
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,980
like, special tree powers and stuff-

1543
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,700
Dryad magic.

1544
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,980
Dryad magic, man.

1545
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:29,900
I would like to imagine that dryad babies are just completely, like, boring and normal people.

1546
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,700
And you see, like, a half-human, half-tree, and you're like, give me your wisdom.

1547
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,020
And he's just like, dude, I work at the plant.

1548
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,740
I got nothing.

1549
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,340
No pun intended.

1550
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,700
I work on my ship models.

1551
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,260
When you guys were younger, did you ever read The Taking Tree?

1552
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,260
Take a tree.

1553
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,700
Give me that sap.

1554
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,180
God.

1555
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,100
Oh, I'm sad in my brain.

1556
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,860
Yeah, me too.

1557
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:04,300
Hey, this Monday, my wife and I will find out if we are indeed going to be parents.

1558
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:09,180
We're excited at the possibility and have started trying to plan ahead things to get.

1559
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,380
One area we're stuck in is a baby-themed room.

1560
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,420
We wanted something different from the normal animal-themed room.

1561
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:15,900
Whoa.

1562
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,020
Whoa, y'all.

1563
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,520
Whoa.

1564
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,900
Animal-themed rooms.

1565
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,900
No, we're sticking with Aminal.

1566
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,220
And felt that the Wise Brothers 3 would provide us with some great thoughts.

1567
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,580
That's from confounded in KC.

1568
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:37,580
I'm gonna throw out, and this is kind of meta, but what about a baby-themed, baby-themed room?

1569
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,860
Oh, man.

1570
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,260
And you just paint babies all over the walls.

1571
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,060
Yeah, and like with signs like, you are this.

1572
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,100
Like, I love that.

1573
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,740
I think that's important for human beings to know what and who they are pretty much instantly

1574
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,420
so they can start growing and learning from it.

1575
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,580
Like, I think you learn from yourself.

1576
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,500
Maybe instead of a baby, it's like a zygote.

1577
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,660
Or like a fetus.

1578
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,780
And you're like, you were this, now get better.

1579
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,060
Ooh, I like that.

1580
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:11,020
What if you took it as an educational thing and you put just a ton of objects in the room

1581
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:17,500
that would say, maybe like out loud, perhaps with one of the greeting card sound chips,

1582
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,660
they would say out loud what they are.

1583
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:24,060
But they would all do it at the same time, and they would do it 24 hours a day.

1584
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,860
Chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair.

1585
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,820
Bad, bad, bad.

1586
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,860
I am drums.

1587
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,300
I am drums.

1588
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,340
Dad's hidden pot.

1589
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,540
Dad's hidden pot.

1590
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,340
Pump shoes.

1591
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,700
Why did you hide your pot in the baby's room, dad?

1592
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,860
You had to touch one of them and it just said, baby, baby, baby.

1593
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,940
And just be Justin Bieber.

1594
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:52,220
Oh, that would be, that would make for probably a Unibomber.

1595
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,460
That would probably make for a Unibomber situation.

1596
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,740
How was my babyhood?

1597
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,460
I will tell you.

1598
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,340
Not great, because I'm looking at that lamp and it's screaming in my brain.

1599
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,500
So it could be better.

1600
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,420
All I could think of when I blew out the building was, well, that's one building of things that

1601
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,020
won't be screaming at babies today.

1602
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,060
Building, building, building, building.

1603
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,020
Building, building.

1604
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:11,980
Windows, windows.

1605
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,220
Windows, I have to kill the building.

1606
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,860
But now it's screaming pit, empty pit, empty pit, empty pit.

1607
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,060
It's just like my heart, heart, heart, heart.

1608
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:33,500
Hey, can we, can we, I want to take a brief hiatus here to tell you about the text.

1609
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,300
Oh, yeah.

1610
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,500
That I just got from my father, our father.

1611
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,140
Did you guys get-

1612
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,100
Me too, yes.

1613
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:46,780
Okay, so he just sent a text that says, in quotes, what day is it, son?

1614
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,500
What day?

1615
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,100
What could that, is that a reference to the hit film We Are Marshall?

1616
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,580
I think it is.

1617
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,780
It has to be.

1618
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:55,740
Oh, but it's-

1619
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,620
I think the response to that is football day or something.

1620
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,420
No, listen, listen, let's explain this because people are going to think our dad is like

1621
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,940
some sort of crazy 9-11 guy.

1622
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,820
I don't think he knows it's 9-11.

1623
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,980
I think the three of us should probably text him.

1624
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,660
I'm texting him right now and I'm asking him if he means September 11th.

1625
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,340
Okay, hold on, let's all take a moment.

1626
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,420
We need to, we need to text him back because I don't want our dad like walking through

1627
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,340
the day with like a spring in his step.

1628
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,020
It's game day!

1629
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,020
Hey, everybody, are you excited?

1630
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,220
Okay, my message is sent.

1631
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,580
I look, I've been looking forward to the day for so long.

1632
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:36,700
Yeah, it seems like it's been 10 years since this last happened, by which I mean football.

1633
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,100
I love football, getting the points, scoring points.

1634
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,300
I get all the points.

1635
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,020
This one was sent in by Jesse Thorn.

1636
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,260
Thank you, Jesse.

1637
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:52,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

1638
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,820
Oh, oh my.

1639
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,460
Who asks, ladies.

1640
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,260
Already winning.

1641
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:05,980
Ladies, if someone paid you $300,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you sit on it?

1642
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,980
What?

1643
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,540
Would you cross your legs?

1644
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,020
If you did, you would get an extra $300,000.

1645
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,980
I have actually asked this question before.

1646
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,980
Sincerely, Skeletor.

1647
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,460
Love, Jack Skellington.

1648
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,620
So many questions.

1649
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:33,100
So many questions, first off, ladies, if you pick the $300,000 above the 300,000 pounds,

1650
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,540
then you are a rube.

1651
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,180
Yeah, I was gonna say conversion rate.

1652
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,140
I think maybe that's it.

1653
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,500
It's like a deal or no deal thing.

1654
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,620
Like you could take the $300,000 or-

1655
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,180
Or 600,000 if you crossed your legs while you do it.

1656
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,860
Or you can get it in pounds and have to spend 10 minutes getting it converted at a bank.

1657
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,460
Yeah, but that's an awkward story to tell the cashier.

1658
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,860
Hey, how'd you get these 600,000 pounds?

1659
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,020
I sat on a real human skull.

1660
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:04,380
These smell like calcium and taint.

1661
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,700
Are you one of those bone jockeys?

1662
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,740
Are you a bone jockey?

1663
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,580
You're people sick of me.

1664
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,300
Hey, Carl, we got another one.

1665
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,260
Look at this one.

1666
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,100
She sat on a human skull.

1667
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,060
She got boned.

1668
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,380
And then they all chuckle, chuckle.

1669
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,380
There are so many questions.

1670
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,420
God damn it.

1671
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,300
Is this skull inside of skin and muscles of a living human being?

1672
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,500
Is it a last request kind of thing?

1673
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,940
Is this how someone wants to get buried?

1674
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,620
It's what I'm saying.

1675
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,980
Is this a Devo video?

1676
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,620
Are we talking about a Devo?

1677
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,700
Is this a Devo right now?

1678
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,140
Are you pulling a Devo on us?

1679
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,780
Like a bloody Devo?

1680
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:52,700
Why does the price point start out at $300,000?

1681
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,100
Why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you haggle up?

1682
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:00,620
I just noticed in the related questions on the sidebar,

1683
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,900
this question by Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

1684
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:09,420
Ladies, if someone paid you $100,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you do it?

1685
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,460
He's driving a hard part.

1686
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,340
If you're offended by this question.

1687
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,420
What do I have to say to get you on this skull before you leave today?

1688
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,420
If you're offended by this question, then ignore it.

1689
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,300
Would you cross your legs?

1690
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,500
If you did, you would get extra.

1691
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,260
It would be the skull of a serial killer.

1692
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:28,320
What?

1693
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,740
You laughed that out when you brought it to $300,000.

1694
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,220
Who?

1695
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,060
He's trying to, he's driving a deal.

1696
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,100
He's trying to make this happen.

1697
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,780
Griffin, what is this username again?

1698
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,740
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

1699
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,300
Okay.

1700
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,380
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

1701
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:45,260
He's like, he's been negotiating this.

1702
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:49,660
He's, for all his foibles, he's a pretty smart negotiator.

1703
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,220
He started low and made a serial killer skull.

1704
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,580
He's like a, he's like a Ron Popeil.

1705
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,660
Like, okay, I'll take out.

1706
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:01,020
It's no longer a serial killer skull, just a regular skull.

1707
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,620
Just a real human skull.

1708
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,780
And also this set of Sham Wows.

1709
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,380
Yeah, I will throw in a solid flavor injector.

1710
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:11,340
Oh God.

1711
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:16,780
Would you slap chop a real human skull for, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bump it up to 400k.

1712
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:22,460
You do have to sit on it before, but afterwards you'll slap chop it into non-existence.

1713
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,660
It'll just be dust.

1714
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,500
I will sit on two horse skulls for 50k.

1715
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,860
You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is one of those circumstances

1716
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,700
where I would rather that this were not a hypothetical question.

1717
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:42,220
Because if he had some purpose behind this, for some reason that makes it okay than him

1718
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,740
just sitting around wondering.

1719
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:51,420
Travis, the amount of work that he has put into negotiating, just yelling into the internet,

1720
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,620
it has to have been resolved, right?

1721
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,780
It has to, it has to have happened.

1722
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,580
It has to have.

1723
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,660
Has to have happened by now.

1724
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,980
Do you realize how much money 300,000, what would I not do for $300,000 or pounds?

1725
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,100
Because to sit on a real human skull?

1726
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,580
Yes.

1727
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,620
It ain't on that list.

1728
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,140
Yeah, I would make the skull.

1729
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,420
I would.

1730
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,300
Night and waiting.

1731
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,220
I would turn the person into a skull, is what I'm saying.

1732
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:26,700
I'm such a fucking sucker though, because that first time around, when he's like 100k,

1733
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,620
I would have jumped at it.

1734
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,260
You would have taken it.

1735
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,100
I wouldn't even thought to hold off.

1736
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,900
You've got to check the trade magazines.

1737
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,300
What's the going rate right now?

1738
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:42,460
You know, I actually got a Groupon for sitting on a human skull.

1739
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,740
Yeah, a bunch of my friends and I are going to do it for 50k.

1740
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,220
The problem is-

1741
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,020
The same skull?

1742
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,140
Yeah, it's the same skull, so there's always a huge line.

1743
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:50,860
You really got to-

1744
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,500
And after a while, you know, it gets warm.

1745
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,180
That skull is pretty rowdy.

1746
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,900
The thing is, he doesn't even clarify and say like, you have to be nude, or it has to be set.

1747
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,100
He just wants you to sit on it, cross your legs, and get off and leave.

1748
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,580
Can we-

1749
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,180
Let's talk about the crossing the legs thing.

1750
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,100
Is he wanting us to incubate this skull like a mama bird?

1751
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,140
Keep it secret.

1752
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,180
Keep it safe.

1753
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,220
You get $300,000.

1754
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,380
But he doesn't say naked.

1755
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,740
So what he's saying is, just sit on.

1756
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,980
Just roll up in your mom jeans.

1757
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,380
Roll up in your mom jeans, sit on it, cross your legs, get off, leave, get out of here.

1758
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,420
Okay, I need to know, can a human skull support the weight of a fully grown adult woman?

1759
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,180
It takes like 14 pounds of pressure to-

1760
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:42,620
We are just skeletons with a big egg on top of our necks.

1761
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,980
So it's just a big egg in there?

1762
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,780
It's just a big-

1763
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,780
It's just like a big stupid egg in there, and it's if a human being-

1764
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,660
If it was like a tiny-

1765
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,420
If it was a baby, maybe, but-

1766
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:58,540
Oh, maybe he's doing that age old seventh grade science experiment where you have to

1767
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,220
build a bridge to save an egg, you know what I mean?

1768
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,300
And you have to walk across it and see if it destroys the egg.

1769
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,500
Travis, there was so much goddamn dumb stuff in that sentence.

1770
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,820
You just said it would take us a week to tear it apart.

1771
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,180
It was.

1772
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,100
It was a seven layer bar of dumb shit.

1773
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,460
You know, an egg bridge.

1774
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,660
You know, egg bridge.

1775
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,780
I saw it on Mr. Wizard.

1776
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,980
You literally just confused like five different science projects.

1777
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:26,300
I was like, you know, an egg bridge, and then you put baking soda on it, and-

1778
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,340
And it's a volcano.

1779
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,380
It's a volcano.

1780
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,780
Let's stop talking about sitting on skulls, because it's literally making my grundle

1781
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:33,740
uncomfortable.

1782
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:38,300
Like, just the thought of trying to perch myself on a cranium.

1783
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,340
I don't think it would feel good.

1784
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,740
No, I wouldn't think so.

1785
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,260
But you know what would feel great?

1786
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,580
I could buy myself a new grundle with 300k.

1787
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,980
Or 300 pounds.

1788
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:48,780
Jesus Christ.

1789
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,100
This guy.

1790
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,380
This fucking guy.

1791
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,940
Do you think he's normal in his day to day?

1792
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,780
You think it's somebody really nice and well respected?

1793
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,980
Do you think it's Tom Hanks?

1794
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:03,420
Oh, couldn't- wouldn't you believe it if somebody was like, yeah, he's a great actor,

1795
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,020
and like, he's a real sweetheart.

1796
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,060
He's got this one thing.

1797
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,380
All right, everybody, we're going to wrap up.

1798
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,340
Hope you enjoyed that best out of episode as much as we enjoyed making those like 10

1799
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,380
or 11 episodes.

1800
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,220
I don't remember if I enjoyed making those episodes, Jared.

1801
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,020
I don't either.

1802
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,620
There's a pretty good chance I didn't enjoy making some of them.

1803
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,860
No, I don't remember what was going on in my life at that point.

1804
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:28,620
I think I referenced my girlfriend, Teresa, which sounds really weird at this point.

1805
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,300
It's like a weird time capsule to reopen these old episodes.

1806
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,420
But we hope you enjoyed them.

1807
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:39,020
We want to say- let's just start it off by saying thank you again to everyone who donated

1808
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,380
to Max Fun Drive.

1809
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,660
It was wildly successful.

1810
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,100
We felt incredibly supported.

1811
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,860
And here's the thing.

1812
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:51,020
Just so you know, if you weren't able to donate, but you still would like to become a sponsor,

1813
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,980
become a donor, you can do that at any point.

1814
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,700
You can go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

1815
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:01,180
You won't get the pledge gifts, but you can still support the network anytime you want

1816
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:01,660
to.

1817
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,260
Do you not get the bonus content?

1818
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,580
I think you still get the bonus content.

1819
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,900
If not, I will fight for you to still get the bonus content.

1820
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,580
Yeah, we will be in your corner.

1821
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,420
But seriously, the response this year was absolutely bonkers.

1822
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,500
I cannot believe how many people came out to support our show.

1823
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:24,860
It was a pretty amazing past couple of weeks, and we have you guys to thank for that.

1824
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,220
So thank you all so much.

1825
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:29,020
Also, thanks to Blue Apron, who makes cooking at home easy.

1826
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:35,260
You can get your first two meals of Blue Apron free by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1827
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:39,020
And we want to say thanks again to MeUndies as well for supporting the podcast and liking

1828
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,500
it.

1829
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,460
MeUndies as well for supporting the podcast and my genitals.

1830
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,020
Go to MeUndies.com slash my brother and get 20% off your first order.

1831
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,700
And right now you'll get free shipping.

1832
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,660
What was that, Griffin?

1833
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:54,380
I just want to say we hit the genitals thing pretty hard when we talk about MeUndies, but

1834
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:58,060
usually it's like a goof thing.

1835
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,060
And you said that so casually.

1836
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,020
I don't know why.

1837
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:01,980
I just wanted to let you know.

1838
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,100
I wanted to stop the show and let you know that that one kind of bothered me.

1839
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,620
That was the first one that bothered you?

1840
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,740
Yeah, I think it was.

1841
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,340
That was a sincere thank you, though.

1842
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,980
I really appreciate the support that MeUndies provides.

1843
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,820
We still have tickets to the Chicago show this coming Easter Sunday.

1844
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,460
Come, celebrate with your whole family.

1845
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,780
I know you're wondering, McElroy brothers, did you know that that was going to be Easter

1846
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,140
Sunday when you booked the date?

1847
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:30,220
And the answer is, but anyway, there's tickets available.

1848
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,860
Bit.ly slash MBMBAM Chicago.

1849
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,300
Please send in your questions with the subject line saying which show you're going to be at.

1850
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,220
I need my Yahoo warriors.

1851
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,340
I need my Davenport's.

1852
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,220
I need my Sperling's.

1853
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:48,220
I need my Ray's to to step up and help me out, help me survive, because that's a lot

1854
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,220
of Yahoo's that we're going to need for all three shows.

1855
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,300
It's three shows worth of questions, people.

1856
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,180
We need your help.

1857
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:53,740
Have we done?

1858
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,940
I know we did three shows in one day before, but this is the first time we're going to

1859
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,700
three discrete cities.

1860
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:59,900
That is very excited.

1861
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,180
I'm very excited as well.

1862
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:07,180
At these shows, we've got some beautiful posters that Justin Gray, you can see some of his

1863
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,660
My Brother, My Brother and Me posters on the Max Fun Store.

1864
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,180
Go to maxfunstore.com.

1865
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,580
A bunch of merch there, just as a side note.

1866
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,700
Lots of awesome My Brother, My Brother and Me merch, some Sawbones merch.

1867
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,220
We're going to get some Adventure Zone merch.

1868
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,220
Yeah, we're going to be filling that up in over the next few months.

1869
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,060
So but go check out his posters there so you can get super excited.

1870
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,740
They're going to be show specific posters, which we've never done before.

1871
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:34,540
We're going to have one specific one for Milwaukee, one for Chicago, one for Minneapolis.

1872
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,500
Like, and they're beautiful, you guys.

1873
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,780
They're fucking awesome.

1874
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,140
They're like, they're fucking great.

1875
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:40,620
I'm definitely going to steal one.

1876
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:44,380
I'm ready to buy one so we can ride all over it and ruin it.

1877
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:49,500
And now that you've donated to the Max Fun Network, go listen to the other Max Fun shows.

1878
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,260
There's Jordan and Jesse Go.

1879
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,540
There's Judge John Hodgman.

1880
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,740
There's Throwing Shade.

1881
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,180
There's Pop Rocket.

1882
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,140
There's Rendered.

1883
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,780
There's a ton of really good shows.

1884
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,740
We do other ones.

1885
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,380
Travis does Bunker Buddies with his buddy Andy.

1886
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,900
Justin does a medical history show called Sawbones with his wife Sydney.

1887
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:12,700
Me and Justin and Travis and our dad do a Dungeons and Dragons podcast called The Adventure Zone.

1888
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:17,500
A bunch of people have asked, now that we've hit all of our goals and everything,

1889
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,580
we're going to totally make my sister, my sister and me bonus episode happen.

1890
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,860
A lot of people have been asking about it.

1891
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,940
A lot of people got really excited about it.

1892
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,300
We're going to make this happen, people.

1893
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:31,980
Fortunately, our wives got excited about it because I don't know about you,

1894
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,660
but I forgot to run that by Rachel before we said we'd do it.

1895
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,900
100% a swing and a miss.

1896
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,860
Teresa heard about it on the show as she listened that day.

1897
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,460
Yeah, I got a message from Rachel that day.

1898
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,900
Like, so I'm doing a podcast, huh?

1899
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,700
And then my response was, oh yeah, I forgot to run that by you first.

1900
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,540
We've talked about it before, but it hadn't become an extant idea.

1901
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,300
We are the fucking worst husbands basically.

1902
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,780
But start thinking about questions you want to ask our wives.

1903
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,380
It's going to be, I'm really looking forward to hearing.

1904
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,700
We don't know when that's, I don't know when that's going to go up.

1905
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,740
We're doing, so because we hit these pledge tiers,

1906
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,780
we're going to do two bonus episodes throughout the year for donors.

1907
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,340
One of them is going to be my sister, my sister and me.

1908
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,580
And we're also going to do, have we announced what the other thing is going to be?

1909
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,580
We're going to do a Freaky Friday swap with some other podcast on the Maximum Fun Network.

1910
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:24,700
Don't know what that's going to be yet.

1911
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,780
I got a few in mind, but we will see how it shakes out.

1912
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,380
So that should be very interesting.

1913
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,300
So it's going to be a pretty bonkers year.

1914
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,900
I've said bonkers a lot.

1915
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,820
Before we get past it, I want to say thank you.

1916
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,380
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their theme song.

1917
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,620
It's a departure off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1918
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,220
It feels good, right?

1919
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,020
It's like a very phonetically.

1920
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,060
It does, it feels really good.

1921
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,100
I think it's iambic pentameter.

1922
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,300
Yeah, it just flows.

1923
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,940
I think it's like one of those things where it's like those are words of power.

1924
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,700
Like Freemanship.

1925
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,100
Let's throw it back to, yeah, it's a Dovahkiin shout.

1926
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:03,420
Let's throw it back to the past and hit you up with that final Yahoo goodness.

1927
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,700
Thank you all so much for listening.

1928
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,340
We'll be back with probably one of our live shows next Monday.

1929
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:14,460
I promise at least one of the three of them is going to sound really good,

1930
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,900
and that'll be the one we throw up first.

1931
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:19,580
So thank you all so much for listening, and we will see you later.

1932
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,700
This final Yahoo was sent in by Galiayali.

1933
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,580
Thank you, Gali.

1934
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,900
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark, who asks,

1935
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,980

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1939
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,500
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1940
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:42,780
Kiss your dad.

1941
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:57,580
Squabble lips.
