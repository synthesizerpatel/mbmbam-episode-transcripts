1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,880
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And Travis has a voice, everybody.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,320
Well, so I thought, you know, it's here, this is the last episode of the year,

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,000
so we could do our normal, every year, like we do every year, standard, just kind of year-end

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,440
review. And just kind of talk about how 2020 went, the highs, the lows, if we can even think of any.

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,040
The fashion, if you think of any lows, the fashion, the trends, the movies that shaped us.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
The cultural milestones, the moments that united us physically.

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes. There's a lot. A lot happened this year.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,760
Was that their pizza rat? Was that 2020?

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,160
No, I think that was 2017.

17
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,960
Shoot, I was pretty close.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,520
I feel so new. Pizza rat, though.

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
Okay, what about Balloon Boy? That feels more recent.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,200
Balloon Boy preceded pizza. Balloon Boy flew so Pizza Rat could walk and steal pizza.

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
So I know that that did not happen in 2020.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
It would have been kicked ass if Pizza Rat flew, also.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, I played some video games this year.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,880
That's not gonna do it, no. We're looking for, Travis, we're looking for cultural touchstones.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,440
We're looking for big important moments in our, in our, in entertainment history.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,080
Because that's what, what are we now if not part of entertainment history?

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,360
Yes. Oh, there was that moment when they said the one movie won an Oscar,

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
but then it was like no, actually.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
Not this year, I don't think.

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Fuck, really?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
I don't think that one was this year.

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
It didn't win one this year, I will say.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
Um, fucking, come on, y'all, Scoob.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Scoob!

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,600
Fucking Scoob definitely came out this year.

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
Scoob, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,520
Did Scoob come out this year? It did.

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Celebrity faux pas. There had to have been those.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Who, who really stepped in it this year?

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Uh, oh, oh, Ellen.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Ellen stepped in it.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,520
Ellen did stepped in it this year?

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh, when she went to that football game.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
She did, she, well, she did that.

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,160
First off, everybody was like, Ellen's not a nice person, surprise.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,080
And everyone was like, wow, that is a surprise.

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Look at her dance.

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,600
Are you chill with W? Can you dance like that?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,680
Yeah, and then she's like, I'm not mean.

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm chilling with war criminal George W. Bush.

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
We're at a football game.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,520
What's more American than that?

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,160
It's hard.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,480
We never really talked about that,

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,600
because I think we always assume Ellen is just on the brink

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
of having us on her program.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
So we don't really talk about that stuff a lot.

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
But the problem is she has to wait for an opportunity

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
when there are three openings.

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Yeah, in a row.

61
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,240
And three chairs.

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
Three chairs.

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
She doesn't, she's having more made.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
That's what her people keep telling us.

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,160
I feel like if the one thing about us is that if we did see,

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,960
if we're at football, if we saw W over there,

67
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,000
just like double dipping some nachos and enjoying a Coke.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
I feel like we probably would be the,

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
this is the exact thing that we would get busted for.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
Right?

71
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
This is the exact thing that would bring it down for us.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
It's because it would be like so funny, so funny.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,620
Yeah.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
GW was there.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,960
I feel like we would have to get a chill going just for the,

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,800
you know what?

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
If Ellen would come out and be like, it was for the Vine.

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, right?

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You know, that was just for the Vine.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,480
Guys, I was making a TikTok.

81
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Don't you get it?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,760
That one was for the Vine.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,320
Guys, fucking Tiger King.

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Remember him?

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,440
I actually missed that.

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,480
I didn't watch it.

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,200
This dude, this dude is straight up zany, gang.

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,840
And the way he hurt those animals.

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
It's not funny.

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
It's not funny.

91
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
But every other thing about him,

92
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,840
aside from the assassination attempt and everything else

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
that that dude sort of snuck his snoot right down into.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
All the other bad parts.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
So fucking zany.

96
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
Zany.

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh, I loved that.

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,640
John Krasinski got out there and he was like,

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,720
it's good, fam.

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,760
And then he was like, and then he sold it, I guess.

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
His show, It's Good Fam.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
He sold that one.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
He sold it.

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
He did sell It's Good Fam.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
I wish.

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,320
It's so great.

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Why can't we ever sell anything?

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,200
Right?

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,120
It would be like if somebody came to you, Justin,

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
and offered you a million dollars

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
to buy the idea of Munch Squad from you.

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

113
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
Which Justin would do.

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
In a fucking heartbeat.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Of course I would.

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
I wouldn't sell it to John, though.

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,560
No.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,880
Because he'll just, he'll move in to Munch Squad.

119
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
Old John K. will move into Munch Squad.

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Kind of polish the place up a bit.

121
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,120
Give it some new curtains.

122
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
The curtains of celebrity.

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
And then he'll sell it at a profit.

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, he'll flip it.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,640
Yeah, he'll flip it for sure.

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
He'll flip Munch Squad.

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
He's a bit flipper.

128
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
He's a bit flipper.

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
Anything else memorable this year?

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Anything else?

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,940
Fashion?

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
Swifties got their fill, didn't they?

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Swifties?

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
You know, Taylor Swift listeners.

135
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh, their bellies.

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,360
They have sucks.

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Oh, they're sated, aren't they?

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
Big bellies laying on the futon.

139
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Just, oh, I could-

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
All that music grease all over their cheeks.

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Oh, I couldn't possibly Taylor another one.

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,440
Oh, we got W.A.P. is a good-

143
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
That was a song that everybody really liked.

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
Yep, yep.

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
That was a good one.

146
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
A powerful anthem.

147
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,600
It's yes.

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
It stood for what a powerful song.

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,800
Yep.

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Women are powerful.

151
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,920
That's what it is.

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,520
That's what W.A.P. stands for.

153
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Women are powerful.

154
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
I never looked it up, but that's what I assume.

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
I like putting together, like figuring out what things stand for.

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,680
It's gotta be women are powerful.

157
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Bacronyms, they call that.

158
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Bacronyms.

159
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
Scott's Bacronyms.

160
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
Anything else from the year?

161
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
There's a big election.

162
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
It's a big one.

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
That one went good.

164
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
Yep, went pretty good.

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,480
Very smooth.

166
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Very smooth.

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,640
I guess Dreamy did come back to Grey's Anatomy.

168
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Really?

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah, he super died, but I guess he came on back

170
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,760
because they're having fun over there.

171
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,240
That's it.

172
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
That's the last one.

173
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
That's all that happened.

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
It was a pretty smooth year.

175
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Pretty quiet.

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
Smooth sailing, baby.

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
At least in the world of entertainment, we can agree.

178
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,760
Yeah.

179
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah, quiet year.

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
A quiet year.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,920
There was that Munch squad about Mountain Dew doing a cookbook.

182
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
You remember that?

183
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, I remember, I remember.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't think we can do our own.

185
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,640
There were some pretty epic things that we did.

186
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,440
That was news.

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
I mean, that was news just because we touched on it.

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,640
Yeah, shoot, Travis, tell me more about these epic things we did.

189
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
At least as long as they weren't epic fails.

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
Oh, then I have nothing.

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
All right, well-

192
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
I started doing play-along at home.

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,640
That was new.

194
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,520
That was new.

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
So big.

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, I found out that GD Ritzies will sell you the Good Ice

197
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,040
by the bag if you want it.

198
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,760
Really?

199
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
The round eye, the little pebbles?

201
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,880
The Good Ice.

202
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,840
They'll give you a bag of the Good Ice for $3.49.

203
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,800
I found that out today.

204
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,040
Nice.

205
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,560
That was a late, late breaking in the year.

206
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,160
I think.

207
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
Okay, so that was our year.

208
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,460
Cool.

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,720
I didn't have any bathroom time accidents

210
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
while driving anywhere in a car.

211
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
And that's every year.

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
And that's not that I do that often,

213
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
but it's why I'm so cautious to make sure I go every time

214
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,920
before I'm about to leave the house is for this exact reason.

215
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
So I can claim at the end of the year,

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,440
no car-based bathroom accidents.

217
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,840
I didn't murder anyone this year.

218
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,960
That's huge.

219
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah, that's huge.

220
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
This is an advice show.

221
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Justin, did you murder anyone this year?

222
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,800
This is an advice show.

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
Only with jokes.

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Where you're never forced to incriminate yourself ever.

225
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll get you.

226
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
You're gonna have to work harder than that.

227
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm wearing a wire.

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Next year, yeah, that's true.

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,400
Next year, we'll be naming 2021, picking the theme of the year.

230
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,120
All right, it's hard to imagine that we'll...

231
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,680
It is a time-honored tradition that we have fucked up

232
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
pretty much every single time.

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
We've talked about this before.

234
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,120
It is cartoonish how bad we did this.

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
It almost makes you want a counter program

236
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
to see if we can steer the year.

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,760
You know what I mean?

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Work against a theme.

239
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I don't know.

240
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,160
That's like it might be.

241
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,520
We've done some, I guess.

242
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,160
Yes.

243
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Collaborating, I feel like some people did okay.

244
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,680
Listen, there'll be plenty of time

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,520
when we talk about this for an entire episode.

246
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,680
But right now, let's help some people.

247
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
How do I pretend that I have actually...

248
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
Yeah, it's a tough sentence construction,

249
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
and I do not blame you for just racing right in there.

250
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
How do I pretend that I have seen Love Actually?

251
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
My friends keep making references to it,

252
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
but I'm just not interested in watching it.

253
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,400
That's from Saving Time in Seattle.

254
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,080
This is a question I very much relate to you

255
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,800
because I too have not seen Love Actually.

256
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Wait.

257
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
That is not true.

258
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,560
That's impossible.

259
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
It is true.

260
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
It is absolutely true.

261
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,040
That's impossible.

262
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,080
Okay, well, okay, let's, okay.

263
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,400
A bunch of established British actors play gentlemen

264
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,840
who have a series of love affairs with their employees.

265
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
You don't really realize that until about 15,

266
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
your 15th watch or so when you go,

267
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,960
damn, this is all bosses and employees,

268
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,360
and they're kissing and everyone's like, yeah.

269
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,840
Rick Grimes is in it, right?

270
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah, so Rick Grimes has got a different-

271
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
This is a different thing.

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,760
He's not a boss, but he is like-

273
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
He holds up a sign.

274
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
So you have seen it, okay.

275
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
I have not seen it, Justin.

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
Everyone knows that in Love Actually,

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
you could live on the moon-

278
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,120
I just find it hard to believe there's no parts

279
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
that you have not osmosed at this point.

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Have you not seen it as an intentional thing or-

281
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
I just never, it's never come up.

282
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
People will be like, oh, you gotta watch.

283
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
And I'll be like, okay.

284
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
And then like, I just don't.

285
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
It's not like I'm actively avoiding it.

286
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,320
It's never happened.

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
Except for, I talked about it a little bit on Twitter.

288
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
And I think the thing is,

289
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
my thing on Love Actually right now is that

290
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
except for all the parts that are bad,

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
it's pretty good.

292
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,680
Okay.

293
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,240
Sure.

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
Well, a ringing endorsement.

295
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm running out of the booth right now to go watch.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
That's everything.

297
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
As you would expect-

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
That's me, right?

299
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,400
I mean, that's me as a human.

300
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Absolutely.

301
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,640
Except for all the bad parts.

302
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,920
I'll give you a guarantee, Trapp.

303
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,000
Bill Nighy fucking rips my thing.

304
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
He does flip.

305
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Well, yeah, he always does.

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
But I could watch him in-

307
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
I could watch him in two Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

308
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
But it was the first thing he's ever been in for a man.

309
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, really?

310
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,920
Yeah.

311
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,880
He's been in stuff where you're like,

312
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,480
who's this fucking clown?

313
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
At the end of this movie, you're like,

314
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
this dude rips.

315
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
Every other thing he's ever been in probably is like,

316
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,040
it's me, parishioner John, and I'm a detective, right?

317
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,720
And it's like seven-part miniseries on BBC,

318
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,600
and I'm parish John, and I'm a parishioner,

319
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
and also a detective.

320
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
God, I'd watch that.

321
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,760
But this one is like, I'm a rock and roll washed out dude,

322
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
and I fucking rip, and I'm so funny.

323
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,600
And my storyline is virtually unproblematic.

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
It is wonderful, it is still problematic.

325
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,640
Except for the fat shaming, it is virtually-

326
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
Enormous amount of fat shaming,

327
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
but by love actually standards, baby,

328
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
that's pretty good.

329
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,840
Is Hugh Grant in it?

330
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
I feel like Hugh Grant is in it.

331
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
Oh, yeah, Hugh's in it.

332
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
He's doing his thing.

333
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
How problematic is his storyline?

334
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,520
Oh, baby.

335
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,680
Trav, I'll tell you, bud,

336
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
President Billy Bob Thorne comes to visit his place

337
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
because he's the prime minister.

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,040
But he, as far as I can tell,

339
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
touches the shoulder of an employee

340
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
that Hugh Grant has his eye on.

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
So he basically declares war on America.

342
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
It's so not far off.

343
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
What?

344
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,960
Travis, in the movie Love Actually,

345
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
which is good, except for the bad parts,

346
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,040
he falls in love with an employee,

347
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,280
and then the president touches her shoulder,

348
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,280
and he fires her, and tells America to fuck off.

349
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
And then he fires her,

350
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,160
but luckily she writes him a note and apologizes.

351
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,000
It's so dopey, and it's so fucking tight,

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
because then the next five scenes are people partying

353
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
because the prime minister just said to America,

354
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
we're not fucking friends anymore

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,640
because you touched and you tried to Mr. Steal My Girl.

356
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,440
Billy Bob Thorne is indeed the president of America,

357
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
which like, yeah.

358
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
Not that far off now.

359
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah, I mean, basically.

360
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
in the Rick Grimes storyline,

362
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,400
he holds up the signs to tell a friend's wife

363
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,360
that he's in love with her.

364
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Is that correct?

365
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Yeah.

366
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,920
So you have seen it.

367
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
I have not seen it, Justin.

368
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,360
So how problematic is that one?

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
Pretty, I mean, I don't know.

370
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
That one's just weird, man.

371
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Love Actually, pretty weird stuff, man.

372
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,080
It's another good name for the movie.

373
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, geez.

374
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,640
There's also, it opens with just a pretty choice 9-11 reference

375
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,440
and then it also ends with us celebrating

376
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
a huge breach of airport security protocols.

377
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
And you're supposed to be like,

378
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
yeah, breach those airport security protocols

379
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,960
for the name of love.

380
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,800
But also, oh, you did the time period.

381
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
Not great for this.

382
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah, it's a trip, not a good flick,

383
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,800
but it's a lot of fun except for the bad stuff.

384
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,280
That feels like a lot of usable stuff for the question

385
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
asker to reference.

386
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,640
Yes, absolutely.

387
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,720
That's literally, I can't think of another thing

388
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,280
you need to know.

389
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,920
Is there anyone else in it of note?

390
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
Everyone is in it of note, Travis.

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,680
Okay.

392
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh man, Mr. Bean's in it.

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
What?

394
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,240
Yeah, he's got a super funny bit.

395
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,760
He's got two actually super, super funny bits.

396
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,280
Laura Linney is in it.

397
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,120
And this is not funny anymore.

399
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
No, you're just listening to things that happen.

400
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
But I feel like, can I say something?

401
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,680
Holistically speaking, we have answered the question.

402
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,400
Absolutely.

403
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,360
Because now, assuming you listened to,

404
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,080
the answer is listen to this episode of My Brother, My Brother,

405
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,680
and Me, and then you'll come away with it

406
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
like pretty much getting it.

407
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Yeah, this podcast within a podcast that I'm calling

408
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,440
Love Actually, Actually.

409
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
There's some porn people.

410
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,240
What?

411
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Yeah.

412
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Some body doubles for sex.

413
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Naked.

414
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,680
A lot of nudes.

415
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,400
Body doubles.

416
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,360
The Hobbit is naked.

417
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
There's a lot of nudity in it.

418
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,680
The Hobbit is naked in it, and Laura Linney is naked in it,

419
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
and other people are naked in it.

420
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
It's like surprisingly like-

421
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,160
Now, Elijah Wood Hobbit or that other guy?

422
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,560
No.

423
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
Watson.

424
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
Fuckin' Morgan Freeman.

425
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah, Morgan Freeman.

426
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Not Morgan Freeman, Martin Freeman.

427
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,600
No.

428
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,240
I said it wrong.

429
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,740
Okay.

430
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
Morgan Freeman, Martin Freeman make love as body doubles.

431
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Morgan Freeman as the Hobbit.

432
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,560
And make a baby named Morgan Freeman.

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,080
Okay, so can I do a Yahoo?

434
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,720
I'd love that.

435
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,080
This is our son, Morgan.

436
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
And we love him very much.

437
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,000
We're proud of him even though he's never accomplished anything.

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
This one was sent in by Brian.

439
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,880
Brian sent this in.

440
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,240
It's from Yahoo!

441
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,280
Answers user more850.

442
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
It never will.

443
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,840
It never will.

444
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,240
He's the worst seven-year-old on the planet.

445
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm extremely proud of my son that I dislike, Morgan.

446
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm proud of him even though he's disappointed in me.

447
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm sorry that I have also wanted to say it's very rude of me,

448
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Martin Freeman, that for a while there,

449
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,520
I took all the parts from everybody and didn't leave any.

450
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,080
That guy.

451
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:22,880
Yeah.

452
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,000
That guy.

453
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,720
We were so close to moving on, by the way.

454
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
We were so close.

455
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,720
What?

456
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,080
I was trying to power through.

457
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
No, but I just wanted to say Martin Freeman treated himself

458
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
to being that guy on The Office.

459
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,920
Then he dipped into Love Actually and got his snoot wet over there.

460
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,560
Then he's like, I'll just go ahead and be Bilbo.

461
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,080
Then he's like, let me real quick just nab Arthur Dent real quick,

462
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
because nobody can think of other people like me.

463
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm just going to get Arthur Dent real quick,

464
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,040
and then I would just love to star in Fargo and go ahead and slide me into—

465
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
Oh, Sherlock?

466
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320
Iconic role of Dr. John Watson?

467
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
Yeah, might as well grab that up too.

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Let me just see how many of these parts I can fit in my mouth.

469
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,240
Well, that's obvious why Morgan can't live up to that.

470
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,920
That's so hard.

471
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,320
Poor Morgan Freeman.

472
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
That's just more stuff you can use when somebody's like,

473
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
you've seen Love Actually, and you can be like,

474
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,440
you mean the one with the dude from Fargo and Sherlock and the Hobbit?

475
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
With a disappointing son?

476
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,440
With a disappointing son.

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
I heard he just joined the soccer team.

478
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,920
We'll see how long that lasts.

479
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay, on a very weirdly related note, Brian sent this in.

480
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
It's Yahoo Answers user more850 who asks,

481
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Has there ever been a scoreless basketball game?

482
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
I couldn't find any example of a pro or college basketball game

483
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
where the plays were tracked, et cetera,

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,360
and where the score was something to zero or even zero to zero.

485
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,560
Has this ever happened?

486
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,920
I assumed it would be a big story if it did.

487
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,800
If it never happened, what is the closest to a scoreless game ever?

488
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Either closest to zero zero or closest to something to zero,

489
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
i.e. widest point margin.

490
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm only interested in documented games, not some game you saw one time.

491
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
It can't actually happen.

492
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
Yeah, basketball rules preclude it, right?

493
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,680
So here's the way it works in sport.

494
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,600
And this is amateur, semi-pro, pro-am, pro.

495
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
And you know this just because you were a scorekeeper

496
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,000
for the, I believe, elementary school team?

497
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Yes, the Miller Owls, I was the scorekeeper for that basketball team.

498
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,760
A school which no longer exists.

499
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
A school that is a park.

500
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,040
Because they fucking slam dunked the house down.

501
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Yeah, they shattered the room

502
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,000
and that was apparently holding the whole thing up.

503
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
The art school, the gymnasium, the lunch room.

504
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
Yeah, so what happened on this is, here's the deal.

505
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,800
Anytime that a score is run up sufficiently on the other team

506
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,520
to where there's not much chance of it being competitive,

507
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
at that point you trade in or you sub in,

508
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
if you wanna use the parlance of sport,

509
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,560
you sub in some of your bad players to give them a chance

510
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,200
to get more accustomed to being on the field or of play,

511
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,240
which is to say the basketball rectangle.

512
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,400
And you give them a chance to kind of get the nerves out,

513
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
like play in your first big game, but the stakes aren't that high.

514
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,880
And the problem is, if you go long enough down that road

515
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
and the other team is still scoreless,

516
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,160
at that point you are mandated to start doing

517
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
what are called inspirational sub-ins.

518
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
They're Facebook bait, basically.

520
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
So if the game is close.

521
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Yeah, like the water boy gets to play.

522
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,040
Exactly, right?

523
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,200
At that point, the mascot comes by and he's like,

524
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
I would love to shoot a few or I'd like to play point guard for a bit.

525
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,360
And like, some guys.

526
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
They start reaching out to people in the crowd,

527
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
like anybody out there.

528
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
Some guy's grandpa who never made the game winning.

529
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,720
You see where we're going.

530
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
The coach, but he's wearing a propeller hat.

531
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,560
A girl, whatever, whatever it may be.

532
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
That was a joke about society, Griffin.

533
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
Oh, look at the layers.

534
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
But the point is, that is what happened.

535
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
The farther down that rabbit hole you go,

536
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
the more people by the end of it,

537
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,040
the opposing team is going to be like Alf, a trash can.

538
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,760
The idea of capitalism, like you're not going to have a team really.

539
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Another stationary basketball.

540
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
That's wearing sunglasses.

541
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
A team from that bottle planet from Superman,

542
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
you know, the bottle city of Kandor.

543
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,320
An actual air bud, but it's just a dog that doesn't,

544
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
doesn't really have the skills.

545
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
He's got to start somewhere.

546
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,880
But that is why you cannot have a scoreless game,

547
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
because eventually there's just no competition whatsoever.

548
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,280
I think it's mean that in professional sports,

549
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
they don't have the mercy rule.

550
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,080
I think that, because I remember being a kid

551
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400
and playing a lot of different sports

552
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,160
and really appreciating the fact that the mercy rule existed.

553
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
Because mostly it meant that I could stop,

554
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
I don't know, picking up pieces of grass in the field or whatever,

555
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
and I could go home and think about my poetry or what have you.

556
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
I think that that needs to exist more,

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
because I would like to see more press conferences

558
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,760
with like grown adults talking about how they got mercy.

559
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
That would be something, although I will say, Travis,

560
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,040
at halftime, the Monstars were up 63 to 18 over the Toon Squad.

561
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
That is pretty high.

562
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,520
They could have gone ahead and joint them off

563
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
to Moron Mountain right then and there,

564
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,840
but they didn't.

565
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
They came back, they played the whole damn thing.

566
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
What a great name for an amusement park, by the way.

567
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
Can we just acknowledge that if there was a place

568
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
called Moron Mountain in your hometown,

569
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
you'd be wicked proud of that.

570
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,880
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm just saying maybe the Monstars weren't the bad guys.

572
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,880
Hey, let's look back and really reexamine.

573
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,680
I think it's time that we put a new lens and look at-

574
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,320
Ooh!

575
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
Space Jam and see if the Monstars are the bad guys.

576
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,080
They were pretty tacitly endorsing slavery,

577
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm pretty sure that team was.

578
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay, there's that.

579
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,240
Yeah, but we haven't even considered the idea

580
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,480
of the scoreless basketball game of two teams playing each other.

581
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
And I'm not saying like it's alpha and a garbage can,

582
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
just like maybe two teams, like the Orlando Magic

583
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and the Charlotte Hornets are just having an off day

584
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
and it's third period, third quarter,

585
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
and it's just like, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

586
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
God, again!

587
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
Eventually one of us is gonna have to get this in,

588
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,080
but it just hasn't happened yet.

589
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
There is another option though, Griffin.

590
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,200
It doesn't have to be they're playing as the worst.

591
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,800
It could be like the Golden State Warriors

592
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

593
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,680
Yeah.

594
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,080
Two teams that I think are good

595
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
or at least have been within the last decade.

596
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
Oh, I see what you're saying.

597
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,600
And they're so good that now it's becoming a defense,

598
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,120
a battle of defense where like they're making good shots,

599
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
but it's just like every time, boom, someone's there,

600
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,920
boom, someone's there, boom, someone's there.

601
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,480
They're playing their gall darn hearts out.

602
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
Alternatively, they both got sixth man.

603
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,360
Oh, wow.

604
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,320
They both got ghost friends, ghost family,

605
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
that are like in there.

606
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,160
And so when somebody comes up to dunk one in

607
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,640
and they just use their ghost hand to slap it away,

608
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,480
I think if that happens to you once,

609
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
that's probably enough for you to be like,

610
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
oh, there's a ghost.

611
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,680
There's gotta be a ghost.

612
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,880
Can you imagine a scene like that happening in a movie

613
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,640
and there's a little kid in the crowd

614
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,560
and he's like clutching his little pennant,

615
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,440
but then the same thing happens for the other team too.

616
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,040
And he looks across the court

617
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,760
and there's another little kid sitting on the other side

618
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
and he's holding a different pennant

619
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,320
and they like look at each other

620
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,480
and they kind of mouth like, did you pray to God too

621
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
that they would win?

622
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Oh man, I prayed to God that they would win.

623
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Oh, beans.

624
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Man, there had to be the MLB commissioner at some point

625
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,920
had to be like, gang, we gotta start keeping an eye out

626
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,280
for these fucking angels.

627
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
Everybody's got angels now.

628
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,040
Everybody's got angels now and it's great.

629
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
We're out there and it's like, oh man,

630
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,280
is old Tony Danza gonna pitch a no hitter or not?

631
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,840
And then it's like, but fucking 10 feet over here,

632
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,360
10 feet overhead, there is a biblical angel battle happening

633
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,320
between both teams.

634
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
Ragnarok is happening right here.

635
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
Every game and it's so loud.

636
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Would you stop them?

637
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
At some point the baseball would stop, right?

638
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,800
Like you couldn't keep doing baseball with that going on.

639
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Well, as in the sky, you see like fucking, I don't know.

640
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,000
Chris Lloyd pulls out his flaming sword and strikes down.

641
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,800
Yeah, you see the little boy stand up and wave his arms

642
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
to signal that angels are here,

643
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
but across the field a different boy is also waving

644
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,680
their arms and you're like, oh no.

645
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh no, it's ghosts v. angels.

646
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,200
Then you hear seven horns and you know.

647
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,880
As the seals rip open.

648
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,560
As the seals, it's time.

649
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
And this is an exhibition game.

650
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah.

651
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,520
We're ending the world.

652
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
This is the all-star game.

653
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
What are you doing?

654
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
It's the home run derby.

655
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
It's the battle where, it's the all-star game.

656
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
It's the battle when all stars will be snuffed out

657
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,280
and darkness will reign.

658
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,920
All stars.

659
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
This is the celebrity versus retired baseball players

660
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,120
charity event.

661
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
What is happening?

662
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
An angel just lifted up Dan Levy and flew him around the bases.

663
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,240
What is going on?

664
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll tell you what's going on.

665
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
We're going to the money zone.

666
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,040
Thank God.

667
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Oh, that was smooth as butter, baby.

668
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
You know what everybody needs?

669
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,360
What, Trav?

670
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,800
Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's a lot.

671
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,520
There's a lot.

672
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,800
But you know what they need most of all?

673
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
Stamps.

674
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,160
Yeah.

675
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,720
Wow.

676
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Yeah.

677
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah, Griffin.

678
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,440
Wow.

679
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,560
Got it one, dude.

680
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,440
Awesome.

681
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
Yeah, it's Stamps.

682
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,520
Awesome.

683
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,400
You ever try to mail one of those letters without it?

684
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,920
Yeah, you get left out.

685
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,280
Not going to get very far.

686
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, it's Stamps.com.

687
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,000

Yeah, Griffin, you idiot.

697
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,720
I did.

698
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,600
We're reading the same ad copy.

699
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,880
I know everything you know.

700
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,240
There's nothing you know I don't.

701
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Okay.

702
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,480
What did I have for lunch?

703
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
Spaghetti.

704
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
No, leftover ribs.

705
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
No, think about it.

706
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,120
Think about it.

707
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,680
Think about it.

708
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,280
Oh, shit, it was spaghetti.

709
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,480
Yes, thank you.

you get a special offer that includes a four-week trial plus, free postage,

713
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,560
and a digital scale.

714
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
No long-term commitment or contracts.

715
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,600
Just go to Stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top,

716
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
and type in one word, MYBROTHER.

717
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,840
That's Stamps.com, promo code MYBROTHER, Stamps.com.

718
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,160
Never go to the post office again.

719
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,800
Well, it's a great time to learn a new language.

720
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,300
Babble.

721
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,420
It's a great time to learn a new language.

722
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,060
It's a good skill to have, and you can feel more connected to a culture,

723
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,540
keep your brain sharp, and you can learn a new language with Babble.

724
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,460
I already knew about that.

725
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,220
Travis has been telling me forever about that.

726
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,100
Babble.

727
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,140
It's a cool new-

728
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,740
You can learn Etruscan.

729
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,140
All right.

730
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,980
It's a new language learning method designed to get you speaking your new language

731
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,340
within weeks with daily 10 to 15-minute lessons.

732
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,580
You start with words and phrases, and then you get to sentences,

733
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,180
and then you get to even more complex stuff.

734
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm guessing paragraphs.

735
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,100
Pretty soon, a couple paragraphs.

736
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,860
Pretty soon, short conversations.

737
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,260
After that, you're reciting monologues, cool monologues from cool movies,

738
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,820
like Reservoir Dogs, but in Japanese and shit.

739
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,300
I've been taking Pig Latin classes.

740
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,500
I've almost done it.

741
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,980
It seems like the Klingons are everywhere, right?

742
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,340
You can't swing a phaser without hitting some Klingons.

743
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,660
They are infiltrating our society.

744
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,420
Sorry.

745
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,860
It's good if you can talk to them and be rational,

746
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,340
as much as they are willing to be rational with you.

747
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,100
Babble's a perfect place to learn Klingon.

748
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,460
All right.

749
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,140
You can choose from 14 different languages,

750
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,540
including Spanish, French, Italian, and German.

751
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,580
Right now, Babble is offering our listeners-

752
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm just going to go out on a limb real quick and interrupt Griffin one more time

753
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,220
to say I don't know if they teach Klingon, Pig Latin, or Etruscan.

754
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,020
I just want to make that clear in case they are listening.

755
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,300
They are.

756
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,780
They're mad.

757
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,060
We're not getting paid for this one.

758
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,740
This one's on the house, Babble.

759
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,940
So right now, Babble is offering our listeners three months free

760
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,460
with the purchase of a three-month subscription

761
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,380
with promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

762
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,500
Visit babble.com.

763
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,300
Use the promo code MYBROTHER on your three-month subscription.

764
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,380
That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com to use promo code MYBROTHER.

765
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,580
I was just kidding.

766
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,620
We're going to get paid.

767
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,340
That's Babble's slogan.

768
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,020
That's good.

769
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,520
Weird.

770
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,460
Hi, it's me, Dave Hill from before,

771
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,340
here to tell you about my brand new show on Maximum Fun,

772
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,940
the Dave Hill Good Time Hour,

773
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,260
which combines my old Maximum Fun show,

774
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,140
Dave Hill's podcasting incident with my old radio show,

775
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,740
the goddamn Dave Hill Show,

776
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,620
into one new futuristic program from the future.

777
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,740
If you like delightful conversation with incredible guests,

778
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,740
technical difficulties, and actual phone calls from real-life listeners,

779
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
you've just hit a street called easy.

780
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,980
I'm also joined by my incredible co-host,

781
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,060
the boy criminal Chris Gersbeck.

782
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,940
Say hi, Chris.

783
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,140
Hey, Dave, it's really great to-

784
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,180
That's enough, Chris.

785
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,260
And New Jersey chicken rancher Dez.

786
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,140
Say hi, Dez.

787
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,940
Hey, Dave.

788
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,540
The Dave Hill Good Time Hour,

789
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,660
brand new episodes every Friday on Maximum Fun.

790
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,540
Plus, the show's not even an hour, it's 90 minutes.

791
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,460
Take that, stupid rules.

792
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,260
We nailed it.

793
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,340
Hey, it's the last time in 2020,

794
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,220
but I did want to say bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

795
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,300
Oh, funeral for a friend.

796
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,740
Yeah, we're going to say goodbye to it for this calendar year.

797
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,740
It's the last final Munch Squad of the year.

798
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,580
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

799
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,420
I want to Munch Squad.

800
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,740
Squad.

801
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,060
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

802
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,660
I want to Munch Squad.

803
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:10,980
Squad.

804
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,220
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

805
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,740
I put it in a minor key.

806
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,460
It was pretty-

807
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,580
Have you guys noticed that the sunset period of Munch Squad

808
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,460
is longer than the first period of Munch Squad,

809
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,140
the sunrise period, I suppose?

810
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,900
There was more episodes in Twin Peaks The Return

811
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,580
than there were David Lynch directed episodes

812
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,300
in the original run.

813
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,220
Interesting.

814
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:41,460
I don't have a Munch Squad this week for this final episode,

815
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:49,140
but I wanted to kind of just go through all the press releases

816
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,420
that are right now.

817
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,260
And I want to say goodbye.

818
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,500
It is not actually the end of Munch Squad, obviously,

819
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,180
but it is the end of 2020.

820
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,980
And that means that it is the end of brands

821
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,300
talking about how bad 2020 has been

822
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,300
and how their products are the solution to that.

823
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,780
So I want to just go through some very quick ones

824
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,300
just to kind of say goodbye to it,

825
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,180
because it makes me happy every time a brand does it.

826
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,940
And so I wanted to say goodbye to them.

827
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,660
And when I tell you some of these headlines of the articles,

828
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,700
you might struggle to think of how they're going to do it,

829
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,980
but I'm sure they will.

830
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,020
Some of these I haven't even found it yet.

831
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm just confident it'll be there.

832
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,300
Tropical Smoothie Cafe introduces Mardi Gras-themed menu

833
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,940
for the new year.

834
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,180
So they got hurricane smoothie

835
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,860
and some fresh Cajun-style food items.

836
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,380
Fresh Cajun-style smoothie.

837
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,380
As guests nationwide welcome a fresh start in the new year,

838
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,020
we remain committed to providing guests

839
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,860
better-for-you smoothies and food

840
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,380
that inspire a healthier lifestyle.

841
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,620
This is Charles Watson, the CEO of Tropical Smoothie Cafe LLC.

842
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,740
We understand Mardi Gras celebrations

843
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,660
may look a little different this year.

844
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:00,980
Okay.

845
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,940
But it's our hope that these fun and bold Mardi Gras flavors

846
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
transport guests to tropic time

847
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,380
and provide a moment for a little break.

848
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,220
How inspirational.

849
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,460
You know, it's beautiful.

850
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,340
Burger King is offering a new dollar menu.

851
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,820
It's the $1 Your Way menu.

852
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,980
We know that value is extremely important to our guests,

853
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,460
especially now, says CMO Ellie Doty in a statement.

854
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,980
That's why we set out to create a menu

855
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,660
that offers craveable products,

856
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,420
like our bacon cheeseburger

857
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,980
that can't be found at the same price anywhere else.

858
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,580
And I got to hand it to them.

859
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,420
I cannot buy a Burger King hamburger for a dollar

860
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,100
at any other restaurant.

861
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,380
But what if you could?

862
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,300
Hi, I'm Travis McRae and here's my proposal.

863
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,500
I call it re-burgers.

864
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,980
Now you sell them the hamburger

865
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,580
and then you buy it right the hell back.

866
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,660
Doty told Business Insider,

867
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,060
this is the part that I really actually can't make heads or tails of,

868
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,540
that Burger King thinks about what might resonate with customers

869
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,020
at any given time during the year

870
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,940
and attempts to provide a solution.

871
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,900
But what do they need?

872
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,700
When we promote a value menu

873
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,860
or launch a $1 Your Way menu,

874
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,620
being sensitive to when that might be most useful to our guests

875
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
is definitely top of mind.

876
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,860
What are you saying?

877
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,820
You have a big red button that says $1 menu

878
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,940
and you're like, not yet.

879
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,660
They're not ready.

880
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,500
We gotta wait until they need it.

881
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
If it goes out now, we will go unappreciated.

882
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,260
The Hangover Crystal returns by popular demand for $1.69.

883
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,220
Folks, I am at three in a row here.

884
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,740
I'm just going down.

885
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,020
The Hangover Crystal is back for $1.69.

886
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,460
That is a little crystal hamburger

887
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,620
with bacon, egg, and cheese and onions on it.

888
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,300
A fresh cracked fried egg, a steamed bun and all that.

889
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,100
Crystal is well known as the go-to remedy

890
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,900
after a night of overindulgence, says Angela Johnson,

891
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,260
VP of marketing.

892
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,820
After the ups and downs of 2020,

893
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,020
the Hangover Crystal with its fresh cracked fried egg

894
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,620
is sure to be the perfect cure after New Year's celebration.

895
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,100
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

896
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,780
That tracks, that tracks.

897
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,060
Papa John's launches new epic stuffed crusts.

898
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,340
Let's see if he's got one here.

899
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,100
Come on, Papa.

900
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,380
Come on, Papa, don't break.

901
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,820
Papa baby hungry.

902
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,180
Papa Shaq, deliver.

903
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,660
He does say, as we continue to develop

904
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,420
new craveable menu offerings,

905
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,580
we're always inspired by our fans.

906
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,820
That's beautiful, I think.

907
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
And it's something our fans continue to ask for.

908
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,060
So you keep giving it to them, don't you?

909
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,420
Nasty.

910
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,940
But wait, they don't explicitly say,

911
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,620
but also things are shitty.

912
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,100
Then we're fucking free, aren't we?

913
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,900
Then we're fine.

914
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,100
This is, I know people are so stoked about this vaccine,

915
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,500
but to me, this is the sign of the times

916
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,620
that we are just through this thing.

917
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,100
Yeah, we finally did.

918
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,020
I mean, that is really the sign, Griffin,

919
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,260
that COVID's over and we're all safe now, you know?

920
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,340
Well, we're getting there, getting there.

921
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,860
Well, it just feels like everybody's safe

922
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,700
to just burn your masks,

923
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
because Papa John says that it's fine to-

924
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,300
Burn your masks, burn your pants, whatever you got.

925
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,940
Really?

926
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,740
Taco Bell's famed nacho fries return for the holidays-

927
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,020
We were out!

928
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,980
In a year as difficult and uncertain as this one is,

929
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,540
we know our customers crave the comforts they love most.

930
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,660
That's why we're excited to bring back nacho fries,

931
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,220
because Trump was a bad president in coronavirus.

932
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,820
And we thought that would help if nacho fries came back

933
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,060
because of so many people that died from coronavirus

934
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,740
and nobody could touch anybody,

935
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,980
but you can't get these nacho fries

936
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,180
and we think he'll fix it.

937
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,100
The magic of nacho fry franchise

938
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,900
extends beyond the menu item itself.

939
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,700
Oh, yes.

940
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,940
It's the magic of the nacho fries franchise.

941
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,460
It's gonna reach out of the menu and into the empty chair

942
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,620
where Grandpa Bob used to sit.

943
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,580
It extends beyond the menu item itself

944
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,300
and is brought to life with our next saga

945
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,700
of the nacho fries movie franchise

946
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,420
that we hope brings some seasonal and seasoned joy to fans.

947
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,580
Like, only we can.

948
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,260
This is another sign of times people are like,

949
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,340
can we start being ironic again?

950
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,500
We've been good boys this year

951
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
just talking about how shitty everything is

952
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,020
and how we hope we can bring you some comfort,

953
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,900
but now can we start getting fucking silly on it again?

954
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,220
Can we go back to pretending like nacho fries

955
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,380
are the most important thing on the planet?

956
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,020
We've been acknowledging that there are other things

957
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,340
on the planet other than Taco Bell for a year now

958
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,860
and it's killing us!

959
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,140
It's killing us! Are they being nacho fryronic?

960
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,540
No, they're not.

961
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,580
Oh, okay. All right.

962
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,620
I really thought they were.

963
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,060
The sixth chapter of the cinematic trailer style ad creative

964
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,540
titled The Craving and starring Sarah Hyland and Joe Keery

965
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,940
explores the thrilling journey of a nacho fry...

966
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,820
Shut up!

967
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,420
Explores the thrilling journey of a nacho fry obsessed protagonist

968
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,980
and his intensifying desire for Taco Bell's

969
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,860
most craveable creation as the potato plot thickens.

970
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,220
I think...

971
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,780
Listen, I'm not going to go off on one of my famous

972
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,700
Dennis Miller style rants here.

973
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah.

974
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,740
But if Taco Bell truly believes that nacho fries

975
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,700
are the most craveable menu item,

976
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,620
then I would say that Taco Bell,

977
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,780
every time it removes nacho fries from their menu,

978
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,780
has committed an immoral act.

979
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,060
Well, you know, Justin,

980
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,020
sometimes the people, they crave it too much.

981
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,420
And society, that's when we have a recession.

982
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,780
So Taco Bell has...

983
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,260
And listen, we're all sad that they're gone,

984
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,820
but the economy is able to rebuild as people once again,

985
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,580
focus on their jobs and bills and whatnot.

986
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,260
But then there comes a time where

987
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,620
it's not about the money, Justin.

988
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,500
It's about the people and the people need the nacho fries.

989
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,860
And it's time for them to come back

990
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,940
so they can be distracting.

991
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,620
Now, here's what I think.

992
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,540
If Taco Bell really wants to commit to this,

993
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,740
they're so craveable.

994
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,100
This movie thing that they're making

995
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,100
would end with a man killing someone to get nacho fries.

996
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,380
It would be gruesome.

997
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,420
And I would say maybe even like NC-17.

998
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
And I think if they did that,

999
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,180
they would probably see like a 3% increase in sales.

1000
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
I mean, I'd love to see them try.

1001
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,740
It'd be worth a shot, you know?

1002
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,240
Yeah.

1003
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,620
There's just not enough like,

1004
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,780
oh, let's make a Hallmark movie or whatever

1005
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,940
about A.C. Slater making some fried chicken.

1006
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,900
And it's like, yeah, okay.

1007
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,740
But how about also there's full frontal nudity in it, right?

1008
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,180
Let's be adults about this

1009
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,100
and let's make our weird fast food movies

1010
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,940
just a little bit more explicit.

1011
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,580
Game of Thrones came out and that was all about Coca-Cola.

1012
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,860
So let's focus on.

1013
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,180
Remember how the end of Game of Thrones

1014
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,060
is about Coca-Cola?

1015
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,900
You remember when it was like,

1016
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,140
there's only one way to stop this dragon flame

1017
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,060
with an ice cold Coca-Cola.

1018
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,220
And they were like, who gets to be king now?

1019
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,860
And they're like Coca-Cola, the king of soda.

1020
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,900
And Coca-Cola changed their motto to Coca-Cola,

1021
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,700
king of soda.

1022
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,660
You remember.

1023
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,700
You remember that, please.

1024
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Remember when Arya Stark was like,

1025
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,060
winter may no longer be coming,

1026
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,140
but that doesn't mean we can't all chill.

1027
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,340
And then she lowered her sunglasses

1028
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,940
and took a big drink of Coca-Cola.

1029
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,340
You remember.

1030
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,780
Ice cold Coca-Cola.

1031
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,140
You remember.

1032
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,640
Remember.

1033
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,180
How about another question?

1034
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,500
Okay.

1035
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Sure.

1036
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,220
I'm at a permanent employee at a place

1037
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,860
that hires a lot of temporary workers for the holidays.

1038
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,380
Mostly having the extra help is great,

1039
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,180
but there's one thing that annoys me to no end.

1040
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,260
I have a favorite seat in the break room

1041
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,980
with the most comfortable chair and the quietest spot.

1042
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
It's a prime spot.

1043
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,740
The majority of my regular coworkers know

1044
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,180
this is my favorite spot

1045
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,860
and leave me be during lunch breaks.

1046
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,380
Breaks and lunch,

1047
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,500
but the new people seem to descend on my table en masse

1048
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,820
and steal it from me every single day.

1049
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,220
How can I keep the newbies away from my favorite spot?

1050
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,660
That's from Seat Squatter in Spokane.

1051
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,220
Well, considering the one good news is

1052
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,180
you listen to this on December 28th or later,

1053
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,100
so they're unemployed now

1054
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,860
and you got, you're sitting pretty, huh?

1055
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,020
Things are looking good over there.

1056
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,300
Things are looking good for you.

1057
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,620
You got that seat back, didn't you, Scrooge?

1058
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,500
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,100
Also, fake vomit.

1060
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,780
Oh, that's good.

1061
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,660
That's another thing.

1062
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,060
A lot of those funny prank gifs,

1063
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,940
whoopee cushion, dog do,

1064
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,660
those are all sort of- Joy buzzer.

1065
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,260
Joy buzzer, put a joy buzzer on there

1066
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,900
and somebody sits on it and it just zaps their ass.

1067
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,420
Just a bunch of crazy glue on there?

1068
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,380
No, that's the opposite,

1069
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,340
because then they wouldn't get up.

1070
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,740
Yeah, what's the opposite crazy glue?

1071
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,620
Sane glue?

1072
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,340
Normal glue.

1073
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,620
Sane lube, I think.

1074
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,500
Yeah, there it is.

1075
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,380
Just some old sand.

1076
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,220
Speaking of pranks,

1077
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:04,340
I was getting some pranks for Charlie for Christmas.

1078
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,580
Okay.

1079
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,940
This kid loves pranks.

1080
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,460
She watches those Troom Troom videos.

1081
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,500
Those aren't even really pranks,

1082
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,060
but yeah, the kid loves pranks.

1083
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,100
So I was getting some pranks

1084
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,500
and there was a prank that was a shocking lighter.

1085
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,220
Huh.

1086
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,060
And I was getting these pranks.

1087
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,100
I looked at that and I was like,

1088
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,980
oh, that would be fun.

1089
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,140
And then in my head, I had this thought,

1090
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,740
I'll have to teach you how to use a lighter.

1091
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,260
And I would realize that what I just thought was,

1092
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,580
I have to teach my six-year-old how to use a lighter

1093
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,340
so they can get shocked by it.

1094
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,340
And that was maybe the worst impulse,

1095
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,580
the worst parody impulse I've had so far.

1096
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,940
And I've had some hun-diggers,

1097
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,860
but I will have to teach my six-year-old

1098
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,940
how to use a lighter so she can be shocked

1099
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,540
by the fake lighter is pretty high on the list.

1100
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,140
I mean, maybe try new chairs.

1101
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,620
Chairs, have you tried all the chairs?

1102
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,500
I feel like probably not.

1103
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,900
Anybody who has a favorite seat in the break room hasn't,

1104
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,300
or at least you haven't tried the chairs in a while.

1105
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,420
Maybe there's some new,

1106
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,460
maybe there's a new sort of spring orientation

1107
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,460
in one of the chairs that you should be excited to have.

1108
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,100
You know, in many ways, a new year is like a new chair.

1109
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,340
Yeah, yeah.

1110
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,260
What's the view gonna be?

1111
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,380
You know, what kind of sights and sounds and smells

1112
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,980
are there in this new chair?

1113
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,020
Oh, I've got a great view of the snack machine,

1114
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,060
and I can see that one of those chip bags is dangling there,

1115
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,300
and if I just slam my shoulder into it,

1116
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,700
free lays, you know?

1117
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,820
And that is a lot like finding love in the new year.

1118
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,220
Yeah, hey, can I do a Yahoo?

1119
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:39,700
Yes, please.

1120
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,420
This one's sent in by Graham Robock.

1121
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,140
Thank you, Graham.

1122
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,620
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dan, who asks,

1123
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,940
what is something non-edible that you wish you could eat?

1124
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,980
Oh, good question, Dan.

1125
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,260
Well, the top Yahoo answer on this is just like,

1126
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,660
and I'm sure they shot this off four seconds

1127
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,300
after the question was posted, and it's Tide Pods.

1128
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,740
And like, yeah, yeah, it's a meme,

1129
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,420
but like, guys, when I see those things,

1130
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,660
I still think like, what's the,

1131
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,580
there's a fucking flavor mystery about these.

1132
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,500
I know that's played, but damn,

1133
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
when was the last time you saw one of these guys?

1134
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,860
The lumpptious they look.

1135
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,460
I feel pretty strongly about dice,

1136
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,580
because there's some like really good looking,

1137
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,540
like hard candy looking dice out there that I love.

1138
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
So you want it to be like a hard candy.

1139
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,500
I like, there's a sort of three-dimensional polygonal

1140
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:38,420
shape to gushers that like, I see a nice D8,

1141
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,540
and I think, oh, I would love to gush on that.

1142
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,420
I think pretty much anything.

1143
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,220
I wish I could just, I think it'd be really dramatic,

1144
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,900
and not for everybody, let me be clear.

1145
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,420
I want to be like Matter Eater Lad,

1146
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,940
where like, I'd just be in the middle of a conversation

1147
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,380
with someone and be like, oh, hold on one second.

1148
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,220
And I just like take a bite out of a car.

1149
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,220
I just think that'd be such a fucking power move.

1150
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,180
Yeah.

1151
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,140
Just cause there's like lots of things you could eat.

1152
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,300
Right.

1153
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,100
Doesn't mean like you would wanna all the time.

1154
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,740
You know what I mean?

1155
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,820
Like, I bet sometimes things are messy.

1156
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,820
Like if Matter Eater Lad had roommates,

1157
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,180
and they're like, it's really messy here.

1158
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,980
Can you eat all the trash?

1159
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,900
Do you think they ever tried to get him to do that?

1160
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,100
Just like, listen, trash stays it for almost a week,

1161
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,940
and there's so much trash that's really piling up.

1162
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,540
Could you just eat all the trash?

1163
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,740
What if Matter Eater Lad didn't have a super power?

1164
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,220
He just really liked making people happy.

1165
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,580
And he really liked that.

1166
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,980
He was just eager to please.

1167
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,420
He loved winning those like dollar, like cafeteria bets

1168
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,020
of like, eat the spoon.

1169
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,860
He's like, okay, you got it, man.

1170
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,540
Matter Eater Lad just had low self-esteem.

1171
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
He would do fucking anything for the vine.

1172
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,380
And really strong enamel.

1173
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,940
That was that.

1174
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,500
Right.

1175
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,740
Yeah.

1176
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,540
It was just committed.

1177
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,420
Yeah, I'm eating it.

1178
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,140
I'm eating it.

1179
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,940
It's fun.

1180
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,660
It's fun.

1181
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,940
We're having a good time, right?

1182
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,860
Everybody, it's fun to have you around.

1183
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,300
You guys remember my name, right?

1184
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,420
You'll remember it tomorrow?

1185
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:02,820
Yeah.

1186
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,220
Promise?

1187
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,540
Hey, you'll invite me to the next party again, right?

1188
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,740
I'm eating the bottle.

1189
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,420
My birthday's coming up soon.

1190
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:08,980
What?

1191
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,780
A shoe?

1192
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,100
Okay.

1193
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,180
Okay, I'll eat the shoe.

1194
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,060
I'll tell you something.

1195
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,340
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you boys

1196
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,740
and the folks at home, one thing that's not edible

1197
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,780
that I wish I could eat.

1198
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,820
And that's Aunt Rhonda's green bean casserole.

1199
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,460
We have an Aunt Rhonda?

1200
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,540
It's fucking putrid Rhonda.

1201
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,100
Wait, I've never met Aunt Rhonda.

1202
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,660
Oh, you would know her by the smell

1203
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,980
of her bean bean casserole.

1204
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,940
That's what she calls it.

1205
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,860
Why doesn't she want to meet me?

1206
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,420
Do you know the woman that dad always brings to things

1207
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,660
and her name is Rhonda and it's his sister?

1208
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,300
Yeah?

1209
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,500
That's your Aunt Rhonda.

1210
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,940
Oh, fuck.

1211
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:54,980
Yeah.

1212
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,620
Yeah, you just never made the connection.

1213
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,740
Yeah, I never put that together.

1214
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,940
You know how there's always that bean bean casserole

1215
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,700
at Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter

1216
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,540
and Halloween for some reason.

1217
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,740
Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

1218
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1219
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,220
And in your mailbox.

1220
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,420
In your mailbox.

1221
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,300
Very threatening.

1222
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,500
Yeah, you know how she always buries a knife in it

1223
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,220
that says you and just leaves it at her doorstep?

1224
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,100
That's Aunt Rhonda.

1225
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,060
Oh!

1226
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,980
You know how every Christmas when she comes over

1227
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,860
she races as fast as she can to your bedroom

1228
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,820
and dumps green bean casserole all over the bed?

1229
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,340
You know how she hides individual servings

1230
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,980
in places you won't find them for months

1231
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,860
until the putrid, wretched stink of this inedible food mess

1232
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,220
has claimed your-

1233
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,180
That's Aunt Rhonda.

1234
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:42,980
Oh, okay.

1235
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,180
Yeah.

1236
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,340
You remember how that one morning

1237
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,740
you went to check on your firstborn and they were gone

1238
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,620
and it was just green bean casserole left there in their stead?

1239
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,500
Yeah, and we launched that nationwide search that lasted for weeks.

1240
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,180
Yeah, but then it turned out it was just Dad's sister Rhonda.

1241
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,680
Yeah.

1242
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,660
That's Aunt Rhonda.

1243
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,820
Oh, that's Aunt Rhonda.

1244
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,980
Trav, do you remember when you were trying to perfect

1245
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,460
teleportation technology and someone left

1246
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,220
a green bean casserole inside

1247
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,540
and you turned it into half green bean casserole, half man?

1248
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,980
Oh, I remember it well.

1249
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,020
That was Aunt Rhonda.

1250
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,900
No!

1251
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,580
Yeah, she's the one that left it there.

1252
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,540
Okay.

1253
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,020
I just can't keep her, I just can't keep that casserole down.

1254
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,820
It's not that bad.

1255
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,220
Put a little ketchup on there.

1256
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,820
The twist of this, the thing we need to clarify in this question,

1257
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,900
what is something non-edible you wish you could eat,

1258
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,740
is would we be able to assign the flavor to it?

1259
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,060
Because things like fingernails,

1260
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,180
if they didn't hurt your belly and they tasted like Pringles,

1261
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,660
that would be pretty cool, I think.

1262
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,500
But I think the reality of it would be like,

1263
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,740
so say it was like cars, right?

1264
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,140
You could take a bite of a car, it would be car flavored.

1265
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,660
It would taste like a car.

1266
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,780
Just because you can chew it up and swallow it and digest it

1267
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,940
doesn't change the flavor of it.

1268
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,660
Yeah, it wouldn't change the atomic, yeah.

1269
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,740
Gosh, I'm having fun today.

1270
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,620
You know what, lotion.

1271
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,660
Lotion would be so good.

1272
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,460
No, okay.

1273
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,300
Yes, actually it smells so good

1274
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,860
and sometimes you get too much lotion

1275
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,780
and you're like, what am I gonna do with all this?

1276
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,980
If you could lick it off your,

1277
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,940
lick it right off your hands, clean off your hands,

1278
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,660
that'd be perfect.

1279
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,020
That'd be so good.

1280
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,940
Would it taste like what it smells like?

1281
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,300
Or would it taste like lotion?

1282
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,260
Which is, I would wager, pretty bad.

1283
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,940
Well, if it tasted too good,

1284
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,020
that would be hard to moisturize

1285
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,940
because then you start licking yourself all the time.

1286
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,460
If the lotion tasted good and you could eat it,

1287
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,140
it has become yogurt.

1288
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,460
Wow, that aught saying.

1289
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,740
Yeah.

1290
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,940
Just like if yogurt makes your hands soft

1291
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,700
and it doesn't taste very good, that's lotion now.

1292
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,620
Yogurt seems sort of flexible enough

1293
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,700
that we're gonna get some people tweeting

1294
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,620
and that's like, actually yogurt makes it great.

1295
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,540
Just stop it, okay?

1296
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,300
Please, 2020 is almost over.

1297
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,180
Let's just get through this

1298
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,100
and you can get back on our case next year, all right?

1299
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,220
But just give us a break for once.

1300
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,780
And you know what?

1301
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,740
We'll do the same for you.

1302
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,740
We'll give you a break from listening to us

1303
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,980
continue to talk.

1304
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,300
Just give you a nice clean one.

1305
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,820
You thought you were gonna have to go into this

1306
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,220
for the long haul

1307
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,700
and we're gonna let you out of class, comedy class.

1308
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,900
We're gonna let you out five minutes early for some reason.

1309
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,660
Sometimes Justin is just done.

1310
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,740
Sometimes I'm just done, y'all.

1311
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,420
It's been a long year

1312
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,820
and I think that we could all use a few minutes to ourselves.

1313
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,540
Yeah, you know what?

1314
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,220
Everybody gets five quiet minutes.

1315
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,740
We're gonna put our heads down.

1316
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,660
Don't look back at the teacher's desk.

1317
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,940
We're back here smoking.

1318
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,900
You locked your kid's door

1319
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,060
and you told them that they could come out in 60 minutes

1320
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,940
when you're done with our show.

1321
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,540
Well, you get five extra minutes,

1322
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,140
however you wanna spend them.

1323
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,340
That's your time.

1324
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,180
That's for you.

1325
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,140
Drink some water.

1326
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,340
Hey, with that five minutes,

1327
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,140
drink some water.

1328
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,340
Close your eyes for a minute.

1329
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,860
Just breathe.

1330
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,980
Just breathe.

1331
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,180
God, just breathe.

1332
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,140
Just breathe.

1333
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,140
And listening and listen to us tell you

1334
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,940
that we got a book coming out.

1335
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,300
A couple of books I wanna tell you about.

1336
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,620
January 26th at 9 p.m.

1337
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,820
There's a free virtual event.

1338
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,700
We partner with six independent bookstores

1339
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,620
to promote our book.

1340
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,700
Everybody has a podcast except you.

1341
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,020
It is a how-to book, a how-to podcast,

1342
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,180
but it's also funny and fun to read.

1343
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,140
And we worked really hard on it.

1344
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,540
And if you pre-order from one of these

1345
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,340
six independent bookstores,

1346
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,620
you can get a exclusively designed book plate

1347
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,780
signed by one of us with your copy.

1348
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,580
While supplies last,

1349
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,420
you can go to bit.ly forward slash McElroy podcast book event

1350
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,260
for bookstore links and more information.

1351
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,620
I also wanna tell you that the Sawbones paperback book is,

1352
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,460
as you're listening to this,

1353
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,940
is out tomorrow, I think, on Tuesday.

1354
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,420
So please, if you have not pre-ordered that already,

1355
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,300
please pre-order that

1356
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,140
because the first week is really important for a book.

1357
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,380
And if you could just tweet about it

1358
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,700
and help us make that a big hit,

1359
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,740
that would be just the best.

1360
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,420
I ordered 20 of them, Justin.

1361
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,900
Thank you, Travis.

1362
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,460
And I'll be reselling them at $3 above market price.

1363
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,580
Wow, that is less great.

1364
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,580
You can get them wherever fine bookstores,

1365
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,780
books are sold.

1366
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,660
Or at my house.

1367
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,700
You can come to my house.

1368
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,620
I'll have 20 copies for sale

1369
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,060
and I'll even sign them for you.

1370
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,060
If you get it from bookshop.org,

1371
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,860
you can actually support a real bookstore.

1372
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,020
Or you can go to TravisMcElroy.com

1373
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,380
and look at pictures of me.

1374
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:32,900
Okay.

1375
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,100
Another great thing to do.

1376
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,820
You can also pre-order The Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom.

1377
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,660
It's the, what, Jesus' fourth book in the series?

1378
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,500
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com.

1379
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,700
It comes out July 13th,

1380
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,740
but go ahead and make sure you got a copy heading your way.

1381
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,900
And we also have a bunch of merch, Travis.

1382
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,340
We do have a bunch of merch.

1383
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,980
If you're listening,

1384
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,820
you have like two or three more days

1385
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,540
to order the Festo pin of the month,

1386
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,380
which benefits the Transgender Law Center,

1387
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,260
that Festo pin.

1388
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,420
It's really, really cool if you haven't seen it.

1389
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,220
And the proceeds go, like I said,

1390
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,500
to the Transgender Law Center,

1391
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,060
which employs a variety of community-driven strategies

1392
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,940
to keep transgender and gender nonconforming people alive,

1393
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,780
thriving, and fighting for liberation.

1394
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,180
There's some Candle Nights merch on there.

1395
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,140
And I know what you're saying.

1396
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,260
Wait, isn't Candle Nights?

1397
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,180
No, it's never over until it is.

1398
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,220
And I guess this year it's January 4th

1399
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,500
is when that's gonna end.

1400
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,140
Because through January 4th,

1401
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,380
all sales of our Candle Nights items

1402
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,220
go to benefit Harmony House,

1403
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,420
which for anybody who has purchased merch

1404
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,180
in the last week or two

1405
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,380
and watched the Candle Nights special,

1406
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,380
y'all have gone above and beyond

1407
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,580
helping us raise money for them.

1408
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,940
So thank you again.

1409
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,140
All of that available at McRoyMerch.com.

1410
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,900
Thank you to John Roderick and Long Winters

1411
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,500
for using our theme song into Departure,

1412
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,100
the album putting the days to bed.

1413
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,220
That one almost got away from me,

1414
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,660
but I feel like I grabbed it by the tail

1415
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,180
and pulled it right back into the boat, didn't I?

1416
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,500
Yeah.

1417
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,260
And the other thing is MaximumFun.org.

1418
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,100
I wanna thank them too in a big way.

1419
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,460
Thanks MaximumFun.org.

1420
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,980
And we wanna thank you.

1421
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,740
You know, it's been a tough year.

1422
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,540
It's been a tough year.

1423
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,340
Here, guys.

1424
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,420
And in a year as challenging as this one,

1425
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,620
I think it's time we explore new Soft Taco opportunities.

1426
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,340
Or as I like to call them, Taco-tunities.

1427
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,220
Yes, thank you.

1428
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,540
This Yahoo was sent in by Connor.

It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1430
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,380
who I'm gonna call Morgan.

00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,700
Asks, how did they move the Statue of Liberty

1432
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,820

00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,700
My name is Justin McElroy.

1434

I'm Travis Adler.

1435
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1436
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,460
This has been my brother, my brother,

1437
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,780
may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1438
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:53,780
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?
