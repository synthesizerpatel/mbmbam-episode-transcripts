1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
And me, I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Gather ye round, children. I have ye a story to tell.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,080
Are you going to talk about the true crime that happened to you?

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm going to tell you about the true crime that happened to me this past fortnight.

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
It was like a couple days ago.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
Okay, we got to stop right now. Is this a horror story,

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
or is it a true crime story? Because you're kind of doing both things.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,680
I tell you, Griffin, it is a true crime story about the horror of humanity.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
The dark passenger that lives in all men's souls.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,800
Okay, so I submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,040
Travis lost some furniture.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,440
The story of the missing patio furniture.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,240
Her tale of this tale through campfires, but it's telling has been changed.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,440
I swear it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,400
I thought that this was internet creepypasta, like a Slenderman.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,960
No, it's true. The patio furniture was stolen.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,760
Theresa and I, when we lived in our last apartment, had to set a patio furniture.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,880
We moved to the new apartment. There was no room for it.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,440
So we chained it together with our bikes in our covered parking space.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,400
You made a little theft honeypot of the two most desired to be stolen things,

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
patio furniture and bicycles.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,320
But we covered it in a tarp, Griffin, which seemed to remove it from inside.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,560
That's gift wrap for stealers.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,240
We shadowed it from the world, and the world could not find it behind the tarp

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,880
in which we hid it to keep it safe from prying eyes.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,680
And so now in our move, we've decided not to take any of that shit with us.

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
So we sold the bikes in like 10 minutes,

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,240
but we couldn't seem to get rid of the patio furniture.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,360
Now this patio furniture was all chained together in an awkward way,

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
stacked atop one another.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
We were gone for about an hour.

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
We came back, it was gone.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,640
We were very frustrated, but at the same time,

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
we had been trying to get rid of it.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
Though for money, not for free.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Not for no money.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
So I was perturbed.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Sounds like you lost a really good chain and tarp as well.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
I just bought a heavy duty lock for like $25

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,160
that I was going to use on our storage unit.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,520
And I was using on the chain, and that was stolen.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,040
And that was a bummy out more than anything.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
That lock was not two hours old.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,600
So I took the dog on a walk hoping that maybe I could like,

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,920
I guess, scope the furniture sitting in someone's front yard.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
The perfect crime.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
And I did not find it.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,320
And I got back to our apartment and there was a dude

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,960
like chilling out on our steps of our apartment.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
And he lives in the building.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,600
And I was like, hey, you didn't by some chance

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,160
like see a truck pull up and like take some patio furniture.

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,440
And he was like, what color?

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,960
As though there were a bunch of patio furniture.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,440
I saw some red furniture get took.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Was that you?

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,880
I saw some yellow last week.

64
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,520
Was that you?

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
And so I was like, well, the patio furniture was black.

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,720
And he was like, oh, it's in the back of the building.

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,800
What?

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,880
And I was like, in the back of this building?

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
He was like, yeah.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
So like I walked back there still chained together.

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,280
It was behind the building.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,800
So someone had moved it from our parking spot.

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,360
I guess ostensibly to plan on breaking apart

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,240
the chain later and using it.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
Or maybe the fact that you left a fucking eyesore out.

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,320
It was a covered.

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
You could not see it from the street.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
A cover didn't make it invisible, Trav.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
You couldn't see it from the street.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
The only way you would have known the furniture was there

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
was by walking into our parking spot.

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
What are you talking?

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
Okay, but like, it's an eyesore.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
I mean, they probably thought they wanted to park there.

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
I guess if you're worried about the beautification

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
of our parking spot, then yes, it's an eyesore.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm saying that's never part of anybody's landscaping.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
I don't care if it was a tarp or covered or what.

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
The Property Brothers are never like,

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,240
and now we got a really nice tarp out here for you

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
covering some things we can't sell.

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
They don't show that on the show,

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
but I guarantee there's always a tarp

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,920
just like tucked into every corner

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,840
of every Property Brothers house.

96
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
You're not allowed to look under it.

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Whoever did this just changed from a horror true crime story

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,880
to a hero story.

99
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,200
Cause whoever did this had to work very hard

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,320
to move this big chain together, bulky furniture thing.

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm talking about a John Henry size two cows stacked up.

102
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
Like that's how big I'm talking of a man or a woman

103
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
or person just like grabbed all this furniture

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
and threw it behind.

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
It must've been really hard for them to do it.

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
And they only did it because you made such an ugly thing.

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
You made it a really ugly thing in the world.

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
It was a beautiful sculpture of furniture and chain

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,480
that they ruined.

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,760
And now that furniture is sitting in my living room

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,440
because now I might power huge and I don't trust the world

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
and I can't put it back out there or it'll just be gone.

113
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Maybe this time I never find it again.

114
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
You wanna get rid of it.

115
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Yeah, but I wanna get rid of it for money.

116
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
I'm an American, Justin.

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,320
I want money for my goods and services.

118
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,280
How much do you-

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
I would really like to know like,

120
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
unless you need patio furniture in your home,

121
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,480
what is step two after stealing a bunch of patio?

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Like, where do you go to buy stolen patio furniture?

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,640
And where do you put it that it's not gonna get scoped?

124
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Fucking Pier 1 Imports.

125
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
A lot of people don't know this about Pier 1 Imports.

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,160
Is that what those quotation marks are on imports means?

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
I always wondered.

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Yeah, if you actually rearrange the letters in Pier 1 Imports,

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,120
it's STOL, pya pya pya.

130
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
Which is Missy Elliott for patio furniture.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Yeah, just stuff to keep in mind.

132
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
Everything in Pier 1 Imports is stolen.

133
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,440
You take it down to Pier,

134
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
you take it down to Jimmy at Pier 1.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
He'll fence it for you right quick.

136
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
Whenever someone says it fell off the back of a truck,

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
it's always a Pier 1 Imports truck.

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Yeah, that's true.

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
They have the worst trucks in the business.

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
I just wanna say, I wanna make a point

141
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,040
that this is Travis's final bim bam

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,640
that's gonna have that like Hollywood sheen.

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,200
You know what I mean?

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,440
This is the last flashy one.

145
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
I've gotten really used to all of our stuff

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,640
having like that Hollywood sheen.

147
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
And we're about to lose that for good.

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
And I'm glad we're getting in like some of this

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
true Hollywood stuff under the wire.

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Like the time that someone moved furniture

151
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,880
that Travis left outside.

152
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
That's the kind of stuff that only happens in LA.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,960
Travis, can I ask you a question?

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
Do you think it was Tom Hanks who did the furniture move?

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Griffin, can I tell you?

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
It reeked of Tom Cruise.

157
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,280
Tom Cruise?

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
There's one thing I know about Cruise.

159
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,040
Loves patio furniture.

160
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,840
I am just so grateful to Travis

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
for reserving this story for us

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
and not selling it to this American Life or Risk

163
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
or another audio store, The Moth perhaps,

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
like audio storytelling format.

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
Actually, I'm gonna do it on Song Exploder.

166
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
What a departure for them.

167
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah, you can really pick up the travel.

168
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
It was just too juicy.

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
It was just too, they couldn't pass up the opportunity

170
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
to break this story.

171
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey, give me a question, please.

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
I got one for you.

173
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm feeling ready for it.

174
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,120
I recently came home to find my garbage can

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,200
and recycling bin sitting in the street.

176
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Whoa, how about this synergy?

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,240
Normally, I would have just attributed it to the wind,

178
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,320
but my neighbors were placed perfectly up right back.

179
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,520
There's a possessive there.

180
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,920
This is not describing the position of their neighbors.

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
Their neighbors is-

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,920
Well, my neighbors are standing perfectly

183
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,960
in the middle of the street.

184
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Our neighbors who are sealed in a giant Tupperware

185
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,680
like that one episode of Eerie Indiana

186
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
were placed perfectly upright

187
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,680
back where I remember seeing them in the morning.

188
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
I thought my relationship with the folks picking up my trash

189
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
was all right, but this has me rethinking that.

190
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
Have I angered my garbage man?

191
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
Can we get back to where we used to be?

192
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
And that's Jess from North Bay, Ontario.

193
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,160
Wait, what, hold on.

194
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
I don't know, wait.

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
I don't know that I've ever given two thoughts

196
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
to what my current relationship with the garbage

197
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
people collecting my garbage is.

198
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,200
Cool.

199
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
Wow, that must be a fucking relief

200
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
considering I probably think about it once a day.

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah.

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Really?

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Are you kidding me?

204
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
You are both homeowners.

205
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
My dumpster gets removed and put back

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
without my knowledge every week.

207
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,280
My relationship is such that I put some really...

208
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I put some off the grid stuff out there.

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,520
Things that I don't expect them to take,

210
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,800
but they always do take it.

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,280
Yeah.

212
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,240
And then sometimes there's a lot of boxes

213
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
because I got on a wild tear

214
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,880
and started ordering a bunch of garbage from eBay,

215
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
like a bunch of FMV games from eBay.

216
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
There's boxes upon boxes out there.

217
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
And I'm so certain they hate my guts that...

218
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
Well, one, obviously, as everyone should,

219
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,400
I tip them at Christmas time, just run out there

220
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,920
and hand them a little bonus, get their beaks wet.

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
But I have actually taken to...

222
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh God, this is embarrassing.

223
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,080
I've actually taken to when the garbage men come,

224
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,840
I take my daughter outside

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,680
and pretend that she loves garbage trucks as me and your children do.

226
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
To try to soften the relationship.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
She waves to them and they wave back.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,720
And I think there's no way they're gonna be mad at me anymore

229
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
after this one.

230
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
I would like to be on the garbage men side of that

231
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
where they're just like,

232
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
we're never coming back to the...

233
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, a little curl.

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
All right, one more week.

235
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
All right, one more.

236
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
We'll come back, we'll do them one more day.

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
I go really hard on Bulk Trash Pickup Day,

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
so much so that I've stopped getting the flyers telling me

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,400
when that day is.

240
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,880
What is this?

241
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,280
I don't understand.

242
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
Bulk Trash Pickup Day is just like,

243
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
it's literally just anything goes.

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
That was the original name of it.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
It's like your couch day.

246
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Yeah, just like fucking whatever, dog.

247
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
Throw your life away day.

248
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
And so I get worried that they're just gonna stop coming to my house.

249
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,720
And so I have a big pile in my garage of good trash

250
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
that I will put on top of the bad trash

251
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,280
to try and entice them into grabbing my can.

252
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,640
So underneath the...

253
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,840
I'll spend all day throwing away old onions

254
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,760
and stinky peppers and all kinds of stuff,

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
just a compost and old racist newspapers,

256
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
just putting all that bad trash in there.

257
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
And then on top of that,

258
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
I'll layer the box of an imported perfume

259
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,520
and I'll put that on top.

260
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,240
And so they open it and A, they'll see it and be like,

261
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,400
this is some good trash.

262
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
We love this guy.

263
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,600
And B, if they wanna just take that good trash for their own,

264
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
That's not how it works.

265
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
Well, if they wanna stick it to their backs,

266
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
like the trash people in the labyrinth.

267
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
Yeah, to make themselves bigger and more protected,

268
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
then they can do that.

269
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
I think they would take it

270
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
and they go back to the trash offices

271
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
and then they show it to all their friends.

272
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Like, look what I found today, boys.

273
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,640
It's a perfume box.

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,920
I don't even know where it's from.

275
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,280
I think Azerbaijan.

276
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,840
No, they get frisked every day.

277
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
So that would be impossible.

278
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Oh, we can't leave.

279
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,280
No, no, no, you don't leave with the nice trash,

280
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
but you can hide it in your locker

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
and show it to your friends.

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
Maybe what you wanna do to fix this back up

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
is to take Griffin's plan one step further.

284
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
And when they lift the lid off the trash,

285
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
you just spread some bills around the top of the trash.

286
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
Like there's just some like 20s,

287
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,600
maybe a 50 or two in there.

288
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Be careful though,

289
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
cause they don't always open.

290
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,200
Here's the thing about garbage people.

291
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,840
They don't always lift the can lid up

292
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,920
to see if you've hidden good trash in there

293
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
for them to take home to their wife and child.

294
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
You're gonna have to hang a note from the tree.

295
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
Money in this.

296
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Yes, but it can't say good trash

297
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
because then anybody would come get it.

298
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,640
Dammit.

299
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,000
Not only that,

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
if they don't open up the lid

301
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
and you throw away all those bills,

302
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
you've done a federal crime.

303
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
You have to do a secret code

304
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
that only the garbage will understand.

305
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
Something like bad trash, too stinky for all.

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,040
Yeah.

307
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
Avoid at all costs.

308
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,400
Banana peels, wink emoji.

309
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
For trash eyes only.

310
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,280
Yeah, cause that's what they,

311
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,040
that's what sort of like script.

312
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,400
They bring home,

313
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
how many cans did you bring in today, Roger?

314
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,240
And Roger's like 400 cans.

315
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,480
It's like, damn, here's 20 banana peels.

316
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,440
And that's how they pay them.

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
Oh, that's the company store?

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
That's the company store.

319
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
And then you trade in the banana peels

320
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
for uneaten bananas.

321
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
So it's like a one in one out sort of economy.

322
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,120
That's solid recycling.

323
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,760
Yeah, dude.

324
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Like all the nanners you want essentially.

325
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
My relationship with them has improved

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,040
to the point.

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
I'll tell you how it fell apart.

328
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
We have, instead of bulk trash pickup day,

329
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,920
we have like, you call the city and say,

330
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,000
hey, listen, once a month you can call

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,680
and it's like, no questions asked.

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
As dirty as you want to be.

333
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
All bets are off.

334
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, nastiest you can get.

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Just like, whatever.

336
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
And a lot of times it's like furniture

337
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,200
that I'm getting rid of our place.

338
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Cause you know, we did that thing

339
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
when we first got married.

340
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
It was just like buying like

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,400
whatever we could cobble together

342
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,200
at Target or whatever.

343
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,480
And then we're like, okay, well,

344
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,040
this is falling apart cause it costs $20.

345
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,360
Yeah.

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,480
So I need to dispose of it.

347
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
And I left it out there

348
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
and then called the city,

349
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
but I left, I put it out there on trash day

350
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
and then the trash guys took it,

351
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,880
but I'd already called and I want to say,

352
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
no, no, no, this isn't for you.

353
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,920
I understand.

354
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
This is like above and beyond trash.

355
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
You don't have to do this.

356
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,280
You're better than this.

357
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,560
Don't take this heat.

358
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,400
You can't stand this heat.

359
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,160
I know it's probably just you coming back

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
with a different truck later, but like,

361
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
don't take this heat.

362
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,840
You can't handle it.

363
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,320
Can we take-

364
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,880
But then they did.

365
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,400
So that's how I got mad at me.

366
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,240
Can we take a second to address the fact

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,000
that like, if you work at all

368
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in like the trash collection industry,

369
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,520
you are a fucking hero.

370
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah.

371
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,040
I don't know how you do.

372
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
Like, I don't like to touch my own trash,

373
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
let alone the trash of hundreds of strangers.

374
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,520
The very idea of trash makes me very sad.

375
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Like not sad, like, oh,

376
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,280
look at all this trash is being thrown away,

377
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,160
but that I have to deal with it in my own home

378
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,360
makes me sad.

379
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
And I wish that there were a robot to do it for me.

380
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
So the fact that you like do it

381
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
and take that heat for us.

382
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
I just want to take a moment

383
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,480
if you're listening to know that I appreciate you.

384
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
Hey, actually, if you are listening,

385
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
maybe we get a new segment out of this,

386
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
like weird trash stories.

387
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,360
Like what's the weirdest thing

388
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
that anybody's ever thrown away

389
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
that you've ever collected?

390
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Just write in with the subject line trash stories.

391
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
And I don't want to hear it

392
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,040
if you're not in the industry.

393
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,200
I want to hear from people who are like in the biz

394
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
or have been in the biz at one point.

395
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,520
Send us a JPEG of your own personal treasure hoard

396
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,000
of the great trash that you found over the years.

397
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,640
And you've just kind of squirreled it away in your den.

398
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,400
If the Trash Comedy Minute works

399
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,560
starring Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen

400
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
have taught me anything,

401
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
it's that trash people go through the trash.

402
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
They show like funny things that they show to each other.

403
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,520
Love that.

404
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Then they, I think, get wrapped up

405
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
in like maybe a kidnapping or some kind of-

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
They probably get kidnapped.

407
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
Crime syndicate.

408
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
I can't remember what happens in that movie

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
after the point where they're rummaging

410
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,640
through other people's trash.

411
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,800
But like, I know there's funny stories.

412
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Dude, you know it's fucking funny though.

413
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah.

414
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
One time I had a trash can that I hated

415
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
and you can't get rid of trash cans you hate

416
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,400
because what are you gonna do?

417
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
Put them in a bigger can?

418
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
It's ridiculous.

419
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
So one time when there was a windstorm,

420
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
I saw that my trash can had been blown across the street

421
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,880
and down a steep driveway into like my neighbor's backyard.

422
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
And I just thought, this is good.

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
Jesus, take the wheel.

424
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,880
Jesus, take the wheel.

425
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,640
He's migrated.

426
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,440
Three days later in what is honestly like kind of infuriating

427
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,040
but obviously it was a miracle.

428
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,200
They brought it in.

429
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
They found it on their doorstep.

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,440
They're like, oh, little fella,

431
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,280
you seem to be in need of a home.

432
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
You're gonna be our trash can now.

433
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,520
Yeah.

434
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
And I was like, oh, thank God I can buy a new,

435
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
better trash can because I hate that old one.

436
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
But I still kind of resented it

437
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,760
because they didn't try to find an owner.

438
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,520
They didn't go door to door knocking.

439
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,080
Just one day go over there just like, that's mine.

440
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah.

441
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,600
Do you want a Yahoo?

442
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,960
Please.

443
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey

444
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
who sent in so many fucking amazing ones

445
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,960
that I feel like we need to give them a title.

446
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,000
And I think that Morgan Davey's Yahoo gravy

447
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
is like we could refer to like the ones that they send in.

448
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, I love that.

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,680
I think here comes a dollop of that Morgan Davey Yahoo gravy.

450
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,400
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

452
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Has this platform just completely collapsed?

453
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,840
It does nothing on this fucking platform work anymore?

454
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,840
This is the last.

455
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm not kidding.

456
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,920
I think they're just, I think they're slow pulling it slowly,

457
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,880
falling slowly like the movie wants.

458
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,040
Anyway, George asks,

459
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
has anyone invented a pornographic kite?

460
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,680
What?

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,200
Has anyone invented a pornographic kite?

462
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
I think it would be a great idea.

463
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Imagine how excited you would be to teach a child

464
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,560
how to fly a stupid kite.

465
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,040
If you know there's going to be boobs on it,

466
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,440
as soon as God's grace it into the air,

467
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,920
I would pay good money for a breast kite.

468
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
And I think that's, I think that's close by.

469
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
I think we could do any sort of pornographic material

470
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,400
on the kite.

471
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
Yeah, I feel like boobs is just so.

472
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,160
Let's not say that.

473
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
Let's just not say the word.

474
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,200
Bosoms.

475
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,000
I think bosoms is far to A to B.

476
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
Let's A to C this stuff.

477
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,160
Let's A to D it.

478
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
You know what I mean?

479
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,560
Like let's make it a deck on there.

480
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,680
Or I'm saying full on like scene.

481
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
Yeah, no, it'll be a scene.

482
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,880
It's, it'll be a scene, Trav.

483
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
No matter what, this porn kite is going to be a scene.

484
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360
But here's the thing, Griffin.

485
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,920
I feel like the question asker is only envisioning

486
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,080
a printed on scenario.

487
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm saying this is a kite shaped like a pornographic scene.

488
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,680
Oh, see, okay.

489
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,000
You've really jumped from A to D there, Trav.

490
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
Cause I think we're not even on, we're not even on B yet.

491
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
So let's start the.

492
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
B is for bosoms.

493
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,680
Okay.

494
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
I think it's just a kite with a pornographic scene on it.

495
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,720
And if you fly a kite that has nudity on it at a park

496
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,920
or a beach or an airport, don't do it in an airport.

497
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,280
Actually, I just thought about it.

498
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,280
You're going to get sucked into the jets.

499
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,520
Well, or at the very least you'll get tangled up on the wing

500
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,160
and then we, you're flying around outside of the plane.

501
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
It's going to be one of those two though.

502
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,040
All those little prints constantly.

503
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,360
Yeah.

504
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,200
One of those mission impossible ghost protocols.

505
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,640
And so you're flying the kite and it has nudity on it.

506
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
And then I think nobody could really get mad at you

507
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
cause it's all the way up in the sky.

508
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
And you can be like, you can't even prove that's mine.

509
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
It's way up in the sky.

510
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
They're all waiting for it to land to prove that it's pornographic.

511
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,560
And that's your challenge to keep it up in the air

512
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,680
until they all go home.

513
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
Your, your, the only response,

514
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,400
I think you could have a pretty good cover

515
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
is if you act like it surprised you,

516
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
but you don't know what to do now.

517
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Oh, come on, come on, get back down here.

518
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,760
This is ridiculous.

519
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,680
I swear when I went up, it had clothes on.

520
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't know what happened.

521
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,280
Oh, it blew, the wind blew its clothes off.

522
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh man.

523
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh, I like that move.

524
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,400
I mean, the wind, the wind, come on.

525
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm saying the easier sell is if it's all the way up in the sky,

526
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
you can disavow ownership of the kite

527
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,040
because it's so far up there.

528
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,600
Nobody, how, how can you prove that this is mine?

529
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Oh, like it's in the stratosphere.

530
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,120
Like, oh, it's this, this kite belongs to God now.

531
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,240
Right.

532
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,400
I might be holding a string that is tethering the kite to terra firma,

533
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
but that doesn't, I don't own it.

534
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,080
It's so, it's so, it's so far up in the sky.

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,880
You know what I mean?

536
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,000
Like if I, if you have a porno balloon and you let go of it,

537
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
you let go of it, it's this, it's, it's in the sky.

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't own this.

539
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,240
They actually can't arrest you either

540
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,560
because the crime is happening in the sky.

541
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,280
So as we all know, it falls under avian law.

542
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,600
Yeah.

543
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
And they cannot arrest you for that because you're on the ground.

544
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,960
Yeah.

545
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
You're out of their jurisdiction.

546
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,040
Like they can kind of like look, like the bird cops can kind of look at like,

547
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,240
ugh, these guys.

548
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,640
Distasteful.

549
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,200
Again, I think the best porno kite you could have

550
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
have rather than like obviously a lentricular scene that evolves as you,

551
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
as it flies through the air.

552
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,400
That would be amazing.

553
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,560
I would like to see kind of just like a naked man who is aware that he's flying.

554
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,880
So he's sort of like, so he's like living two dreams at once.

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
Like, wow, why is this happening?

556
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah.

557
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,640
Lentricular material, I think will be too heavy to catch, to take flight, unfortunately.

558
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:18,960
Yes.

559
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,320
Yes, but I think we could get the naked man dream going.

560
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
Does he have his arms up over his head like Superman?

561
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,360
Yeah.

562
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,120
And it's a human sized kite and the background is clear.

563
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,680
So you just looked up there and be like, holy shit, Superman done lost his mind.

564
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,320
Now the thing is, Justin, I'm going to say my worry here is it's not pornographic enough.

565
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,040
It sounds like it's just-

566
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,720
Because there's nothing pornographic about it.

567
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, it's just nudity.

568
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,040
You know what I mean?

569
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,120
Like that's, that is a nude kite.

570
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,960
Well, you got to give him a facial expression that looks like he's up to something.

571
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,040
Yeah, I don't know.

572
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah.

573
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,240
I know it when I see it, you know, and that certainly has a look.

574
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
He certainly has a look of like surprise at flight, but also-

575
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,320
Maybe he's cranking his hog.

576
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
That's one thing that could happen.

577
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,760
And maybe that the hog crank sort of mechanism is attached to the string.

578
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,120
And so you can really just get it going.

579
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Vroom.

580
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,400
That's not the kite sound, but kites don't have a sound.

581
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
You wind it up with the rubber band real tight before you let it go.

582
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
And then once it's up there, just like off to the races.

583
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,400
And when the rubber band runs out, it just drifts back to earth.

584
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,080
And that's the end.

585
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,640
Everybody go home.

586
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,680
The kids get out of here.

587
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,960
I think my favorite part of this question is the word inventing.

588
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
Yeah, because I would like to see that laboratory.

589
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
I'm just saying invented is a weird way to put it.

590
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,920
When was the last time someone invented any kind of kite

591
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,680
rather than just like making a kite?

592
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
Doug Funny's dad invented the fighter kite.

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
That was the most pornographic episode of Dogfighter.

594
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

595
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Because then Mr. Fink, was that his name?

596
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,640
Frank?

597
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,560
What's his fucking name?

598
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,080
Mr. Funny is Doug Funny's dad.

599
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,720
Well, but then he had the weird neighbor who was also an inventor.

600
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Who was like, Mr. Dink was like,

601
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
yeah, let's put some dogs on there.

602
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,360
And then Roger Clodz is like, sexy kite funny.

603
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,840
That's really good, Griffin.

604
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
Griffin, you've been hiding a perfect Roger Clodz under a bush.

605
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
That was really good Roger Clodz.

606
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm gonna crank my hog to that later, Funny.

607
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,440
Well, hold on.

608
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,680
Watch me crank my hog, Funny.

609
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,200
Oh, no, no, no.

610
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,760
No, not like this.

611
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
No, no, this is ruined.

612
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
I recently moved into a shared house

613
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
and have several new roommates, four of us own cars,

614
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,880
but there's only one parking space in the driveway,

615
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
which has been claimed by the person who has lived there the longest.

616
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
Every other place I've lived was treated the driveway

617
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
like a first come first serve.

618
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,520
As the newest member of the household,

619
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
I don't wanna rock the boat too much

620
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,560
by questioning the validity of their claim,

621
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,840
but it hardly seems fair they should have the driveway reserved for them

622
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,040
based on seniority while the rest of us battle for street parking.

623
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Is their claim acceptable?

624
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,040
Do I risk creating drama by bringing it up?

625
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,320
Added info, this person isn't someone I wanna make a fight with.

626
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,280
They're opinionated, hot-headed, and controlling.

627
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,760
That's from Powerless Parker in Portland.

628
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,280
I've been watching Deadwood for the first time,

629
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,440
and let me say this about vis-a-vis claims.

630
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
You guys watch out about stepping on claims

631
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,680
because that's how you end up getting pigs.

632
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,360
If anybody says that they wanna reconnoiter the parking space-

633
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,920
Yeah, you ain't gonna reconnoiter shit, dog.

634
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Don't do it.

635
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,800
You're gonna get flung.

636
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,400
I have a plan for this person.

637
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,960
All right.

638
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
I've been playing the Game of Thrones board game.

639
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,520
A lot of HBO sort of dramas are sort of informing our strategy this time.

640
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah, and in the Game of Thrones board game,

641
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,920
there's like, there's victory tracks.

642
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
Okay.

643
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
And you, like, if you wanna hold the Iron Throne,

644
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
you do it through bidding with your power.

645
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,400
So what if, rather than, like, you all bid money

646
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
to see who gets the parking space,

647
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,240
and when the person who wins,

648
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,480
that money goes to buy dinner for the other people in the house?

649
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Are you fucking kidding?

650
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,720
Like, to, here's what you'll get.

651
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Either one nice dinner, or not have to street park for a year.

652
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
Well, but hear me, I'm not done.

653
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
At any point, well, let's say after a week,

654
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,440
anytime after a week, someone can call a new bid to order.

655
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,760
Maybe they've had, like, a bonus at work,

656
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,920
or they had, like, a really good sale,

657
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,680
or they sold off their Xbox so that they could park at the driveway,

658
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,000
and they call a new bid,

659
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,800
and so everybody bids again,

660
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,320
and it's constantly up for grabs.

661
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
There's gonna be a lot of power struggle.

662
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't think it's gonna make things easier,

663
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
but I've watched a lot of Game of Thrones,

664
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,240
and I think it's gonna be a lot sexier, a lot more exciting.

665
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,800
There's gonna be a lot of intrigue, a lot of whispers.

666
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,360
Someone's gonna be probably killed.

667
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,960
Little birds.

668
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,600
Little birds.

669
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
They're doing their thing.

670
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,040
Dragons.

671
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,080
Here's the night.

672
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,160
Building off of Travis's bad idea with a good one.

673
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,880
Well, hold on.

674
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
It just needs some polish.

675
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
Well, allow me.

676
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,600
What if you put a price on the parking space?

677
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
So you said, hey, listen, I want your parking space.

678
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm willing to pay 50 more dollars in rent per month,

679
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,280
and that is a trickle-down benefit to everybody else.

680
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,760
So you can either take $50 off that person's rent

681
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,920
or split it up with the rest of the house.

682
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,520
Everybody's winning, and you're just flaunting your affluence.

683
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
Because if, honestly, you don't want first come, first serve,

684
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,040
that's a nightmare.

685
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,240
You'll never leave the house.

686
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
All your ideas have been bad so far.

687
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,720
Okay.

688
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,220
Okay.

689
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
The right answer is all of you sell your cars.

690
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,280
Hold on.

691
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,000
This is a little Give to the Magi, Griffin.

692
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,800
No, no, no.

693
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,320
Well, you haven't let me fucking finish.

694
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
This would be like if Give to the Magi was like,

695
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
I need a watch band.

696
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
I love my hair.

697
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,700
The end.

698
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,080
No.

699
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
You sell all your cars.

700
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
You put all that money in a pool.

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,880
You buy...

702
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
There's four of you?

703
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,500
Yes.

704
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,900
You buy four scooters, right?

705
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,060
Scooters are much smaller, much more fun to ride,

706
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,380
very usable in Portland.

707
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,500
You have a scooter race, and then whoever wins the race

708
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
gets to use the driveway.

709
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,980
But if you have four...

710
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,180
They can buy their car back.

711
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
And they'd try their car back.

712
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,700
You have to...

713
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,940
Everybody else, oh, that's it, Justin.

714
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,300
We're doing this shit for pinks.

715
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,540
You do the scooter race, whoever wins gets all the scooters,

716
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,980
can sell as many scooters as they want to buy back a car

717
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,220
that then they get to use in the driveway.

718
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,980
And nobody else has cars anymore.

719
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,740
So you don't have to worry about parking them on the street.

720
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,260
So...

721
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,420
You know, in the short live HBO series, Vinyl,

722
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,140
I don't actually...

723
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,420
I didn't actually watch Vinyl.

724
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:04,980
Okay.

725
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,900
I could tell you guys about Entourage.

726
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,540
There's the episode where Vince buys everybody a car.

727
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,340
Does that help here?

728
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,780
In the television show, Big Love, a very tall man

729
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,860
loves a very tall woman as well, just very much.

730
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,220
And it's sort of like a good romance story.

731
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,300
And so just love each other.

732
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,140
And just like the car thing will work itself out.

733
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,900
That's beautiful.

734
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,860
That's really good.

735
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,820
Beautiful, Griffin.

736
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,220
Did...

737
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,860
Who's the...

738
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,220
Okay, I do have to say though,

739
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,260
you entered into this house understanding this arrangement.

740
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,420
I don't know if the fault lies with you

741
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,780
for not understanding the politics before you moved in,

742
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,940
or the fault lies with the others for bringing in a usurper.

743
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,980
You probably had a look about you of a usurper.

744
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,540
Oh, yes.

745
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,620
The fact that they would still bring you into their home.

746
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,540
Maybe the blame is on them.

747
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,340
I don't know.

748
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,220
They should be screening better for usurpers.

749
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,260
At the very least, you...

750
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,460
I don't know.

751
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,860
I just feel like some kind of monthly rotation.

752
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:00,740
Yeah.

753
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,460
There you go.

754
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,100
That's nice.

755
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,620
That's good.

756
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,660
Something where it's just like we all acknowledge that this is...

757
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,500
Because right now this is so non-mutually beneficial

758
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,100
and so ironclad.

759
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,500
Like this person is a despot.

760
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,260
This person who has been there the longest

761
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,460
and says the car is mine is a despot and must be overthrown.

762
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,780
Hey, how about you just...

763
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,060
Hey, listen, come close.

764
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,020
How about you just fucking park?

765
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,700
Just fucking park there.

766
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,820
What are they gonna do?

767
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,320
Yeah.

768
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,620
Then, oh, you don't like my car there?

769
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,100
Go outside and lift it, tough guy.

770
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,380
Go outside and pick it up and move it somewhere.

771
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,780
Well, wait.

772
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,220
It sounds like this person could do that

773
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,180
because they're very big.

774
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,220
If they do that, then they earn the spot.

775
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,020
They deserve it.

776
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,220
And that gives you a reason to go get cut

777
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,900
so you can lift their car up.

778
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,620
Oh, I like this.

779
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,940
It becomes a strong man competition.

780
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,820
Exactly.

781
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,020
What if it's Brock Lesnar, though,

782
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,140
and he just eats the car?

783
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,900
That's another...

784
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

785
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,020
Eat his car.

786
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,140
If you eat his car piece by piece

787
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,260
at a pace at which he will not recognize it's happening

788
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,860
and then one day he goes

789
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,180
and he parks his rear view mirror out there

790
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,820
and he's like, man,

791
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,460
this thing just doesn't have the get up and go it used to.

792
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,900
You eat that last piece.

793
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,420
And he's like, I thought I had a car.

794
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,460
I guess not.

795
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,900
And you are dead.

796
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,780
But there is a good thing that you could park there

797
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,500
whenever you want.

798
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,860
Just real quick.

799
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,620
Dad just texted all of us.

800
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,180
Ask is just saying that he's about to make a jungle gyms run

801
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,740
and wants to know if we want him to pick us up any food.

802
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,500
Can you text him and see,

803
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,060
ask if they have any instant horchata?

804
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,500
I would just love a bag of that.

805
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,740
Okay.

806
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,420
I had some at the beach and it was top.

807
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,220
Well, that is...

808
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,100
Well, that would be for you.

809
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,460
So I think you could probably swing that.

810
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,580
Maybe when we're done recording,

811
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,980
I'm gonna...

812
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,260
I'm recording a podcast right now.

813
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,180
Travis says a bag of pig buttholes.

814
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,860
So this is,

815
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,940
we're having a lot of fun with this text chain with our dad.

816
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm gonna put a corollary on Travis

817
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,860
that he wants Cajun flavor.

818
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,180
Yeah.

819
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,100
But make sure you blast those butts.

820
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:15,940
Let's go to the Money Town.

821
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,860
I wanna tell everybody about how I sleep.

822
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,940
I have a little pillow shaped like a crunch bar

823
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,100
that I nestle into my arms.

824
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,140
It's a Nestle's crunch bar for nestling in my arms.

825
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,260
That's a super weird way to do your sleeping, I think.

826
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
Well, I used to have a log shaped pillow,

827
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,980
but I just upgraded to this crunch bar pillow.

828
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,260
This log shaped pillow,

829
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,060
sorry, just a quick side.

830
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,060
You used to take it with you traveling everywhere

831
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,780
and you would sort of hang it from a strap of your backpack.

832
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,980
And when you did that,

833
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,740
and I do not wanna get blue here folks,

834
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:54,580
but it was like a diagram of a scrotum with testes

835
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,300
that they might have at like a doctor's office

836
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,500
or like maybe they would bring it to like a middle school

837
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,940
to like teach boys about like sort of their pezone down there.

838
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,340
So clinical was this diagram that Justin would take with him

839
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,580
just walking around like his backpack had truck nuts

840
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,380
as he went to E3 or Pax East or what have you.

841
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,180
Yes, that's true.

842
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,820
I did have truck nuts for my backpack,

843
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,740
but now that part is done with and now we've moved on

844
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,100
to the crunch pillow.

845
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,860
Anyway, this is like not the point,

846
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,500
but the point is I'm sleeping on Bowling Branch sheets

847
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,020
and they're the most comfortable,

848
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,820
best sheets that I've ever slept on in my entire life.

849
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,420
Whether you're a four hour night type

850
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,860
or more like a 10 hour night type,

851
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,420
Bowling Branch makes getting a good night's sleep possible

852
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,060
with their super comfortable sheets.

853
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,420
And they don't just sell sheets,

854
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,020
they have duvet covers,

855
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,660
they have so much great towels, sheets, blankets, everything.

856
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,340
And here's the best part.

857
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,340

Bowlingbranch.com, promo code MYBROTHER.

870
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,900
Travis, tell me all about trunk clothes

871
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,220
because I know you've been getting your fashion game, right?

872
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,740
So we all like pants, right?

873
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,300
I disagree with the whole sort of premise of your assertion.

874
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,260
So listen, here's the thing.

875
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,700
I was recently talking with people

876
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,820
about this whole cargo shorts thing.

877
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,580
We're not gonna get into that here,

878
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,140
but I was talking with people about fashion

879
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,260
and somebody made the claim of like,

880
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,540
I don't care about fashion.

881
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,140
Fashion is not important to me.

882
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,220
And listen, I understand that.

883
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,180
I feel the same way.

884
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,780
I don't know two shits about fashion,

885
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,700
but I went into trunk club.

886
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,500
I did like a fitting with a stylist

887
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,580
and what I ended up with, and I can't stress this enough,

888
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,980
the best looking and most comfortable pair of jeans

889
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,380
I've ever owned in my entire life.

890
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,780
Like I don't know what it is about them,

891
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
but they both look great

892
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,340
and they are my favorite pair of pants to wear.

893
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,500
And so that was my first kind of view into the fact

894
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,340
that maybe this fashion thing is onto something

895
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,260
and it's not just about looking good,

896
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,620
but it's also about feeling good.

897
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
So if you've been away from fashion

898
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,260
because you don't know, I got two words for you.

899
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,460
Trunk club.

900
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,140
Trunk club.

901
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,700
Trunk club.

902
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,740
Trunk club.

903
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,500
You can maybe make it into one word,

904
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,700
but that's not what it is.

905
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,580
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

906
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,020
What it is is you go on trunk club,

907
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,500
you tell them what kind of clothes you're looking for

908
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,460
and what kind of events like you would wear them to

909
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,780
for work, for parties, for outings,

910
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,060
for fancy occasions, for doing podcast live shows.

911
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,620
And you tell them like what your style is

912
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,460
and they're going to come back at you

913
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,380
with some amazing suggestions.

914
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,740
They're going to ship it to you.

915
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,140
You're gonna try it on.

916
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,500
You're gonna keep what you like.

917
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,780
Ship back what you don't

918
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,380
and you're only going to pay for what you keep.

919
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,260
It's an amazing deal.

920
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,060
And it's like having your own personal stylist

921
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,420
because that's exactly what it is.

922
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,300
I was going to make that into a simile,

923
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,180
but you just do have a stylist.

924
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,660
When you ship the clothes back to them

925
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,180
that you didn't want to wear,

926
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,660
do you include some fun sized candy bars with it

927
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,820
to just be like, hey, thanks for trying?

928
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,980
I just put some bills in there.

929
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,580
So we're all just kind of about just like giving money

930
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,980
to people who were afraid we've upset for some reason

931
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,820
or will upset in the future.

932
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,860
I don't want them to be mad at me

933
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,460
because I didn't like that pair of pants.

934
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,500
So here's, there's $20 in the pocket.

935
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,700
And there's a three musketeers,

936
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,740
but oh, it's melted all over.

937
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,940
Oh, the pants are ruined.

938
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,820
Oh God, oh God, please, please not like this.

939
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,180
And so it's expert advice, amazing clothes

940
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,180
and you can get started today

941
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,700
by going to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

942
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,300
And when you do that, you're going to type

943
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,540
in your measurements, share your likes and dislikes

944
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,980
and you get your own personal stylist

945
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,300
when you use that code, my brother.

946
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,420
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother

947
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,740
and get all set up today.

948
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,820
Get your sexy on as Mr. Justin Timberlake would say.

949
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,980
Can you request a name?

950
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,860
We forgot the lyrics.

951
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,580
Can you request the name of the stylist that you want?

952
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,500
Can I be like, I want someone named Trey

953
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,980
to tell me what kind of vest to wear.

954
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,500
I want a Bernice to be like, here's your vest Griffin.

955
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,580
And listen, here's the coolest part for me.

956
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,900
If you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles,

957
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,660
Chicago, DC, or coming this fall, Charleston, South Carolina,

958
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,940
they have clubhouses where basically

959
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,740
you can go try on the fucking kick in the door.

960
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
Like where's Trey at?

961
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,940
Where's Bernice?

962
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,380
I need some pants Trey.

963
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,860
Hey, I got a personal message here.

964
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,300
We do jumbotrons on this show and this is one of them.

965
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,940
It's a message for Kristen and it's from Stone who says,

966
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,020
hey, things are so good that I figured

967
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,180
I would have the brothers relay this message.

968
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,740
I know you won't marry me, but how about we start

969
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,420
that perpetual engagement.

970
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,140
The ring is forthcoming, but a jumbotron is cheaper.

971
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,420
So I started here.

972
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
Love you so much and thanks for putting up

973
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,860
with my shit during D&D.

974
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,700
Man, I really hope that Kristen and Stone

975
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
are in some kind of a relationship

976
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,740
that doesn't make this weird.

977
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,180
No, it's probably good.

978
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,420
I mean, they're their fellow D&D players, so.

979
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,020
Well, they definitely know each other,

980
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,940
but maybe they've never had any romantic entanglement whatsoever.

981
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,300
Or maybe they have.

982
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,260
I don't know what that noise was.

983
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm sorry, it wasn't the noise you made

984
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,100
and I tried to match it, but it came out different.

985
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,740
Stone, we hope you got the desired reaction

986
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,980
from this message that you did for yourself and for Kristen.

987
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,860
I have one for Mike and it's from Skittles Joe,

988
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,420
who I thought was only on Still Buffering,

989
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,020
but I guess he's crossing over.

990
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,980
That fool's everywhere.

991
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,060
Oh God, he's crossing over, get the blasters.

992
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,220
Mike, I'm glad you survived your second fight with an SUV.

993
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,900
I hope the miracles of modern medicine

994
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,060
have helped you get your bones back together

995
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,380
and your lung completely unlacerated.

996
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,420
I look forward to many more years of your friendship,

997
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,020
your wonderful puns and your mockery of the Welsh.

998
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,620
I hope these words from the McElroy brothers

999
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,660
give you a laugh.

1000
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,060
Hey, Mike, wanna buy a duck?

1001
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,740
I hope they don't give you too big of a laugh

1002
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,660
if you're working through some lung stuff.

1003
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,660
Man, I hope Mike didn't die.

1004
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,220
Man, I hope-

1005
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,780
Cool.

1006
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,580
No, come on.

1007
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,020
Shoo, I just do.

1008
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,780
I do hope, I mean, I put that for everybody.

1009
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,420
You know what?

1010
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,100
I hope Mike never dies.

1011
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,700
Well, sure.

1012
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,140
I mean, if Mike's taken on two SUVs and been fine,

1013
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,420
I think he's kid-tested mother approved at this point.

1014
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,260
I don't think you blow Mike down with a-

1015
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Yeah, dibs on Mr. Glass, by the way,

1016
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,780
if we've got an unbreakable.

1017
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,340
Yeah, for sure.

1018
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,820
Well, I think Skittles Joe is gonna be the Mr. Glass here,

1019
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,700
except his bones are like a bunch of Skittles.

1020
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
You know those commercials where the guy touches the stuff

1021
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,540
and it turns into Skittles?

1022
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
That's what Skittles, that's what his bones are like.

1023
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,340
Oh, poor guy.

1024
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,180
Also, Samuel Jackson does not play him in this one,

1025
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,060
unfortunately.

1026
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,620
Couldn't get him.

1027
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,940
This is Samuel M. Jackson.

1028
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
The next one in the alphabet.

1029
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,180
New York City, listen up.

1030
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,820
Your fellow MaxFun listeners and hosts are gathering

1031
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,140
at Stuart Wellington's New Brooklyn Bar

1032
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,340
and you're invited.

1033
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,780
You probably know Stuart from his hilarious movie

1034
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,300
riffing on the Flophouse,

1035
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,420
but did you know he's also a small business owner?

1036
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,780
It's true.

1037
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,660
Join Stuart and a ton of New MaxFun friends

1038
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,140
at the Hinterlands Bar on Saturday, August 27th at 7 p.m.

1039
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,940
You can find more information at bit.ly

1040
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,820
maxfunhinterlands.

1041
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,100
See you there.

1042
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,340
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

1043
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:57,800
Hit me!

1044
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,540
Someone sent in by level 9000,

1045
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,580
Yajurijuriju Davenport.

1046
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:00,980
Thank you, Drew.

1047
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,660
It's by Yajuru Answers user Kobe.

1048
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,700
Now that is a Yahoo Answers website page

1049
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
that loads good and right.

1050
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,140
We got two advertisements.

1051
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,940
They're both loading.

1052
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,820
They're both animating.

1053
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,940
It's going fucking great.

1054
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,100
Cody asks.

1055
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,980
Kobe asks, is it normal to get aroused by the sight

1056
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,140
and smell of garlic bread?

1057
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,860
Wow, this is a really sexy episode.

1058
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,300
So I was at the dinner table

1059
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,900
eating garlic bread with the family

1060
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,700
and I started to feel a tingly sensation down there

1061
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,220
and I asked to be excused to go to the toilet

1062
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,580
and I pulled my pants down.

1063
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,740
Oh man, really?

1064
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,020
If you are a kid,

1065
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,060
if you are a kid, please turn that, please turn the pot.

1066
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,420
Sometimes like we do live shows

1067
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,900
and like 12 years old come up to us

1068
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,140
and like thank you for the, thanks for helping shape us

1069
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,060
and I'm like fuck, that's not great, but okay.

1070
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,660
But seriously, it's a crime if you don't turn,

1071
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,980
it's entrapment if you don't mute the podcast

1072
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,020
for the next five seconds.

1073
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,500
I asked to be excused to go to the toilet

1074
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,780
and I pulled my pants down to find

1075
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,540
I was completely drenched.

1076
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,380
I don't think this is normal.

1077
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,420
What should I do? What?

1078
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,460
I'm like this for the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster.

1079
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,260
I get there and I get there and it's Shrimp Fest

1080
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
and I get so excited for Shrimp Fest

1081
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,260
that I forget that it's always Cheddar Bay Biscuit Fest

1082
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,620
and then I'm just soaked.

1083
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,660
God. God bless.

1084
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,620
Just soaked through.

1085
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,060
Garlic bread's really good sometimes.

1086
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,380
If it's that like Texas toast garlic bread

1087
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,940
where it's just like you're eating a frisbee-sized piece

1088
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,980
of bread and it's lightly garliced on top,

1089
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,100
like fuck that shit.

1090
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,980
But if we're talking about some knots with some herbs in it

1091
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,620
and some garlicky cheesy butter in there.

1092
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,420
There's a wild variance in quality of garlic bread.

1093
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,900
Yeah, you really don't know what you're gonna get.

1094
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,420
This is an important question, Griffin.

1095
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,500
In the Yahoo Answers question you just read,

1096
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,220
had this person begun eating the garlic bread

1097
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,500
or had the garlic bread,

1098
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,860
or were they just like anticipating the garlic bread?

1099
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,900
They were eating garlic bread.

1100
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,100
Okay. Okay.

1101
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,620
That was important because I was gonna say

1102
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,460
that this is an unfortunate experience

1103
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,380
if you feel this every time you anticipate garlic bread

1104
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,580
and then you eat it and you're like,

1105
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,420
whoa, that didn't deserve that.

1106
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,380
There's a lot of unfortunate things about this, Travis.

1107
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,700
Namely like you can never go to Olive Garden.

1108
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,420
Well, you can go to Olive Garden once.

1109
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,500
You better plan your day though.

1110
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,340
You better have a whole exit strategy.

1111
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,260
Maybe do it on a birthday or something before you're 18.

1112
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,780
But do it on a birthday

1113
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,340
and just have it be like a really nice special day

1114
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,180
and you're just like, no, going in.

1115
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,260
This is the first and only time

1116
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,060
I'll ever be allowed inside of an Olive Garden.

1117
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,140
You'll know if you find someone with this condition

1118
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,740
if you're an Olive Garden waiter

1119
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,780
because when you ask them what they want,

1120
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,740
they're the ones who stare off into the distance for 10 minutes.

1121
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,860
Like, oh, what a question.

1122
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,420
What does one get?

1123
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,980
What does one get at their one visit to the Olive Garden?

1124
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Oh, what a question.

1125
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,380
Any special-

1126
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,900
How is the spaghetti?

1127
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,460
Could I have the garlic bread and a garlic bread sandwich

1128
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,700
and garlic bread with spaghetti on top of it, please?

1129
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,780
And a privacy curtain.

1130
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
And maybe like a couple bibs.

1131
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,220
I would humbly request that rather than bringing the bread first,

1132
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,060
as is a common practice,

1133
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,060
I would ask that you bring my meal before the bread

1134
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,540
and perhaps the checks as well.

1135
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,460
And then clear a pathway for me.

1136
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
If you offer any Andy's Mints,

1137
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,580
I would request that you deliver those to my table

1138
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,100
before the bread portion of the meal.

1139
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,340
And no, I will not remove my mask.

1140
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,660
One more recommendation,

1141
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,060
just before you do bring that garlic bread,

1142
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,300
make sure to contact mall security ahead of time.

1143
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,980
I will go willingly,

1144
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,820
but I don't want a lot of fuss.

1145
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,980
Hey, this Kevin,

1146
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,820
this Kevin that's talking to you right now

1147
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,180
will go willingly.

1148
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,140
Garlic bread Kevin,

1149
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,620
no rules just right.

1150
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,420
Is that your thing?

1151
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,140
I just spit coffee in my face, you asshole.

1152
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,220
I got a whole situation here.

1153
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,540
For real though, garlic bread is really good.

1154
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,900
So good usually.

1155
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,260
Oh, I know the answer.

1156
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,540
Oh, and it might kill it.

1157
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,860
Listen, Yahoo answers question answer.

1158
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,620
Kobe, this might kill you,

1159
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,700
but it's the only way you're gonna get through this.

1160
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,020
You're gonna have to go through immersion therapy.

1161
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,580
Oh God.

1162
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,740
You're just gonna have to like spend a long

1163
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,300
like bank holiday weekend eating garlic bread nonstop.

1164
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,660
By the end you will be super dehydrated.

1165
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,100
Yeah, well, yeah, you gotta be in a bathtub the whole time.

1166
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,060
You could also learn how to make garlic bread yourself.

1167
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,180
You'll have an advantage there

1168
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,500
because you'll always be the first one to know it's done.

1169
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,500
That's a good point, yeah.

1170
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,300
That's a good bake.

1171
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,980
Wait, hey, is it done yet?

1172
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,860
Nope, not yet.

1173
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,580
I'll tell you.

1174
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,420
Welcome to the weirdest episode of Great British Bake Off ever.

1175
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,500
Oh man, don't even let him in that tent.

1176
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,380
That's a bad bake.

1177
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,500
Don't eat that, Mary.

1178
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,420
Mary, no, God, Mary.

1179
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,740
Mary, Mary.

1180
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,260
You simply cannot.

1181
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,700
That's got a soggy bottom.

1182
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,260
A soggy bottom, it's a bad bake.

1183
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,780
Soggy front, more like.

1184
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,260
Twice a month, my family has a game night.

1185
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,300
We usually play Uno.

1186
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,660
Recently, my cousin who's nine started playing with us.

1187
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,980
When he plays, he's always sitting next to me.

1188
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,180
Every time his turn comes around,

1189
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,340
he plays his draw twos, draw fours, skips, and reverses on me.

1190
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,100
And I never get a chance to play

1191
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,500
and always end up in last place because of his bullshit.

1192
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,620
At what age is it appropriate for me to tell him

1193
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,780
to stop being a fucking asshole?

1194
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,660
That's from last place with 479 points.

1195
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,380
This is so unbelievably good.

1196
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,420
His fucking bite-sized Moriarty is ready for you at every turn.

1197
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,780
He's always ready to thwart whatever plans you've cooked up.

1198
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,300
Have a nice combo all lined up and he's well, well, well, well.

1199
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,020
Draw four.

1200
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,420
Hey, Steven, do you remember when I was seven

1201
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,700
and at my seventh birthday, you took the corner piece of cake?

1202
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,660
Draw four, motherfucker.

1203
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,540
Draw four.

1204
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,660
I've been planning this shit for two,

1205
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,220
honing my Uno skills for this moment.

1206
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,860
Here's the thing.

1207
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,660
If this interloper, this little nine-year-old devil fish,

1208
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,100
is the first one to put the screws to you like this while playing Uno,

1209
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,500
you and your family actually haven't been playing Uno up to this point.

1210
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,060
That's true.

1211
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:01,140
Because Uno is a savage game about hurting your opponents without reservation.

1212
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,380
It's why it's called Uno, because by the end of it,

1213
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,020
you'll feel alone and unsafe in the world,

1214
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,020
and like you're the only one you can trust.

1215
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,180
Yeah, it's actually pronounced you know,

1216
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,100
because now it's just like your little nine-year-old

1217
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,420
just fucked you over on the battlefield and he's like,

1218
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,220
and now you know.

1219
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,700
Now you've had a taste.

1220
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,220
Now you know what Toby can do.

1221
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,300
That's sort of like, that's about as good a pick as

1222
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,900
when I was at the beach with my in-laws and several cousins and uncles.

1223
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,260
I thought it'd be fun if everybody played some werewolf.

1224
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,060
Oh, boy.

1225
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,980
And just flash forward to an hour, just a pure hour

1226
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,540
of everyone at the table calling everyone else a liar.

1227
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,980
Just like constantly everyone accusing everyone of lying for an hour.

1228
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,660
There's a lot of really good vibes after that sesh.

1229
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,740
And then you went to Joe's Crab Shack.

1230
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,660
Then we went to Joe's Crab Shack.

1231
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,500
Do we want to talk about the Margaritaville,

1232
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,580
the harrowing Margaritaville voyage that you tried to go on?

1233
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,260
Okay, so I'm at the beach living the beach lifestyle like Island Boy do.

1234
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,860
You know how he does it.

1235
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,460
And we head over to Broadway on the beach,

1236
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,740
which is in Myrtle Beach, which was about a half hour from Paulie's Island.

1237
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,900
Oh, Jesus, you had to drive a half hour on this?

1238
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,020
And it was 40 minutes of the traffic, my dude.

1239
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,820
So we drive 40 minutes over there.

1240
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,380
And first off, we parked at the opposite end of the place from the Margaritaville.

1241
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,300
So I'm like, oh, fuck, can I get a good walk?

1242
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,420
Gonna be all sweaty for Jim when I show up.

1243
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,780
That's embarrassing.

1244
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:38,900
On the drive over, my father-in-law, Tommy, low country Tom, tells me that if I,

1245
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,060
the last time he was at Margaritaville, fucking he rolled up and the place was packed.

1246
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,180
Who's there playing a set?

1247
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,260
Why, it's James Buffett.

1248
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,820
I would fucking dissolve.

1249
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,860
My anticipation is already like off the charts.

1250
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,940
It's like I've been eating garlic bread all day.

1251
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,660
I'm out of control here.

1252
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,700
Just flooded.

1253
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,460
Just that basement is flooded.

1254
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,580
Just drenched.

1255
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,580
Now, have you been to a Margaritaville before, Justin?

1256
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,260
Was this your first experience?

1257
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,500
Yeah, but it was before I went through the change of life.

1258
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:08,900
Oh, I see.

1259
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,300
Which means becoming a dad and getting really into Jimmy Buffett.

1260
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:17,140
So we walk through this place and it's sort of like if Jersey Shore,

1261
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,900
it's not Jersey Shore, the TV show, but it's got that like boardwalk vibe,

1262
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:30,020
but it's in the sweltering miserable 95 degree heat of South Carolina.

1263
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,100
And we're strolling along.

1264
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,300
I have to walk past a closed down Magic Quest,

1265
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,900
which is like the saddest, I know, fucking brutal.

1266
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,900
I walked past a magic shop that I didn't have time to go into

1267
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,140
because I was so hungry for some of that coconut shrimp prepared by JB himself.

1268
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,340
Had the magic shop absorbed all the magic for Magic Quest?

1269
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,900
And that's why it closed.

1270
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,420
You know, they thought it was a heyday.

1271
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,380
They were like, well, listen, there's a lot of wands over there.

1272
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,620
Let's go get our fill, pick it clean.

1273
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,020
They looted it.

1274
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,100
Like the vultures we are.

1275
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,580
So we get to Margaritaville.

1276
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,540
It is 5.30 somewhere.

1277
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,660
I'm going to say the afternoon.

1278
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:14,500
It is 5.30 somewhere and it's 5.30 there as well.

1279
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,100
So I should have anticipated that five o'clock is the worst time

1280
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,180
to go to Margaritaville, obviously.

1281
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,100
But we show up at 5.30.

1282
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,740
My daughter is like basically like dehydrated.

1283
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,580
She's just a husk that I'm like dragging behind me on a leash.

1284
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,340
And we're like dead basically.

1285
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,780
We're like on the verge of death.

1286
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,660
And I show up and I'm just I'm looking around like peeking around

1287
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,140
like I know JB's probably expecting me

1288
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,860
because he heard I am boys on his way over.

1289
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,580
I get in there and they tell us to see our party.

1290
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,260
We are going to have to wait.

1291
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,540
This is not an exaggeration.

1292
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,700
Two hours.

1293
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,020
Whoa.

1294
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,340
How many were in your party?

1295
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,220
Thirty thirty six.

1296
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,340
Thirty six no seven people and a baby.

1297
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,300
There's a people too.

1298
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,860
But like you got to specify that for a high trimmer.

1299
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,340
Well, OK.

1300
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,460
You explained the wait actually earlier in the story

1301
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,340
and that is that Jim James Buffett the third

1302
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,820
is making all the coconut shrimp himself.

1303
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,780
It is the only thing on the menu which is kind of weird.

1304
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,420
Like he doesn't know how to make margaritas

1305
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,420
which is like he's obviously very successful.

1306
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,860
He has people who do that for him.

1307
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,540
But he can make a mean fucking coconut shrimp.

1308
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,340
So you mainly just come in and you get the shrimp.

1309
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,460
No questions asked.

1310
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,180
But it does take him a while to prepare them.

1311
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,860
So two hours.

1312
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,700
Two hours of waiting.

1313
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,380
Two hours.

1314
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,100
No way.

1315
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,700
Absolutely cannot do it.

1316
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,820
And what's that like lurking over my shoulder behind me?

1317
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,620
You guessed it.

1318
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,140
Fucking Joe's Crab Shack.

1319
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,420
The second choice.

1320
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,780
Like we're always second choice.

1321
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,380
America's second choice.

1322
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:47,940
Yeah.

1323
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,980
America's second choice.

1324
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,660
And like I would have had to walk like

1325
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,580
if we didn't want to eat Joe's Crab Shack

1326
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,060
we would have had to walk all the way the fuck back up here

1327
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,540
to eat it like the Japanese hibachi place

1328
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,940
at the Myrtle Beach Broadway on the beach.

1329
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,220
Like no not happening.

1330
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,340
It's got to be Joe's Crab Shack.

1331
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:02,980
We would have died.

1332
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,940
We wouldn't have lived.

1333
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,060
I get in there.

1334
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,260
They're playing matchbox 20s.

1335
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,740
Not one of the good ones.

1336
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,700
Like my favorite.

1337
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,340
No actually my favorite one.

1338
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,580
And I'm like whoa this is pretty okay.

1339
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,540
I sit down.

1340
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,460
I order a crab pot.

1341
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,660
They put a bib on me.

1342
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,220
Oh man.

1343
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,060
Doesn't it say something like this guy's a queef?

1344
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,380
It wasn't Dick's Last Resort girl.

1345
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,860
Oh sorry I got confused.

1346
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,940
They put one on me that says shrimp it ain't easy.

1347
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,220
Okay so they do write on them.

1348
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,060
They did write on them.

1349
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,060
It didn't say this guy's a real queef.

1350
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,540
I didn't realize that I'm the only one at the table

1351
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:46,340
that ordered a dish that necessitated in a bib.

1352
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,900
And I'm also the only one at the table

1353
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,180
who is not living a life in which physical fitness

1354
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,300
is a large component.

1355
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,780
Oh no.

1356
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,620
To put it in a ginger way.

1357
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,740
So this like it literally looks like they have.

1358
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,740
I don't know a nice way of saying this.

1359
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,740
I'm shaming myself here but I'm the only fat one

1360
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,580
and I have a bib and claw crackers

1361
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,740
that they brought special for me.

1362
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,820
Literally 20 minutes before I did not need to be living

1363
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,500
this life for 20 minutes before the food arrived.

1364
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,300
They addressed it like very early on in the meal.

1365
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,420
I was drinking a huge glass of blue drink

1366
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,100
that had a shark filled with a red drink

1367
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,820
that I poured into it called a shark bite.

1368
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,540
There was a limit to on those on the menu it said.

1369
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,620
Wait was the vessel the shark vessel full of red liquid

1370
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,060
was it a glass shark?

1371
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,180
No sadly it was a rubber shark that I did.

1372
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,500
My uncle Michael did steal it though so that.

1373
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,740
Damn Mike you can't leave me anything.

1374
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,060
On this the worst day of Justin's life.

1375
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,580
You couldn't leave him anything.

1376
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,100
No he stole it for John.

1377
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,500
He didn't just steal it from us.

1378
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,220
So just when I think.

1379
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,260
You should change his name

1380
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,860
in case they're looking for him Justin.

1381
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,660
Just when I think this could not get any darker.

1382
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,940
JB has abandoned me just to recap.

1383
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,140
JB has abandoned me.

1384
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,700
I'm wearing a bib that says shrimp and easy.

1385
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,820
And I'm the only one there.

1386
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,020
I want it.

1387
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,340
Another facet.

1388
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,700
There is a guy making with a balloon hat

1389
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,340
making balloon animals table to table.

1390
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,500
And I can just see from his orbit

1391
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,940
that he's like about to collide with Planet J man.

1392
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,660
And I'm like this cannot get any fucking worse.

1393
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,740
And then over the radio Tracy Chapman's fast car

1394
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,620
comes on in the Joe's Crab Shack.

1395
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,620
I love this fucking song.

1396
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,620
I do not want that.

1397
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,340
And like jalapeno slammers to be in the same zip code.

1398
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,380
It is uncalled for that I should be subjected

1399
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,460
to Tracy Chapman's beautiful dirge of pining and longing

1400
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,940
for a better life that she'll never arrive

1401
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,900
than why I'm sloppily eating caging crab legs

1402
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,260
out of a bucket with a bib

1403
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,340
while a balloon dipshit hovers

1404
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,260
and waits for his moment to pounce.

1405
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,940
It was the worst day of my life

1406
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,300
but the desserts were okay.

1407
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,260
Three out of five stars.

1408
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,700
And a s'mores thing and this concludes my Yelp review.

1409
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,900
And then we went to the Gilligan's Island Goofy Golf.

1410
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,260
The only Yelp review said that every time this guy goes

1411
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,660
there's someone pleasuring themselves on the sixth hole.

1412
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,260
And he said that's a must.

1413
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,860
What was the sixth hole?

1414
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,620
It was nothing.

1415
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,820
There was nothing there.

1416
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,060
There was no one pleasuring themselves.

1417
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,620
But there wasn't a particularly sexy bunker?

1418
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,980
No, but it did.

1419
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,140
I mean, it made sense there was a shack

1420
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,260
that said garlic bread

1421
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,500
except the sign had been like painted over.

1422
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,580
So obviously it was no longer available.

1423
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:48,980
Yeah.

1424
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,340
Which maybe explains that.

1425
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,620
But yeah, so that was basically the hardest day of my life.

1426
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,300
And I blame Jimmy Buffett for it.

1427
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,140
Why isn't the media covering this?

1428
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,540
Is what I wanna know.

1429
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,580
Where is the media?

1430
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,020
That's what I wanna know.

1431
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,260
Give Lockdia break for a second.

1432
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,300
He'll be there.

1433
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,580
Okay, he's not gonna swim away.

1434
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,140
Trust, he's gonna keep on fucking up.

1435
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,620
So just like wait till tomorrow.

1436
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,380
Just come give me a day in the light.

1437
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,660
Give me a day in the light.

1438
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,660
Just my day at court.

1439
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,420
That island court.

1440
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,900
You wouldn't sue James, would you?

1441
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,380
Who would you sue?

1442
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,980
No, I just want a small, I mean-

1443
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,540
Give me a list.

1444
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,380
Give me a Kill Bill top five list

1445
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,620
of people who wronged you in this story.

1446
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,660
Starting with number five

1447
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,660
until we get up to the main offender.

1448
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,940
Okay, number five, myself.

1449
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,620
I did agree to go

1450
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,140
and I knew that it was in Myrtle Beach.

1451
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,180
That's not really one of island boys hangouts.

1452
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,180
That kind of violates this whole chill lifestyle.

1453
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,820
Yeah, absolutely.

1454
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,780
I blame the server for not recognizing me.

1455
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,700
Like the greeter at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville,

1456
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,740
I blame him for not recognizing me from podcasting.

1457
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,660
Yeah, how many times did you say the phrase,

1458
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,780
don't you know who I am?

1459
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,100
Just the once, but I thought that would be enough.

1460
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,100
I said, I'm about to shoot a streaming TV show, sir.

1461
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,180
That didn't fly.

1462
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,860
And I've made many jokes about my fan hood of James Buffett.

1463
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,060
Yeah, can you call, so number three, James,

1464
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,820
but I can't really blame him.

1465
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,180
He can't be everywhere at once

1466
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,100
and the server, despite my request,

1467
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,260
the greeter would not call him

1468
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,380
on like the coconut telegraph

1469
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,300
or whatever they use to communicate with Jimmy.

1470
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,580
So that would be your kill Bill interaction there

1471
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,420
where you actually were interacting with Bill

1472
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,460
and you didn't want to do it,

1473
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,860
but you knew you had to to give your life

1474
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,380
some kind of like closure.

1475
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,660
Right, did you know if you cut a coconut open

1476
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,860
and you whisper into it, he'll hear it.

1477
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,540
But he might not always answer the way you think.

1478
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,380
Yeah, you gotta look out for signs.

1479
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,740
You're not gonna get the answer you want,

1480
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,420
but you're always gonna get the answer you need.

1481
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,100
Thanks, James.

1482
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,260
Number two, number one, just real quick.

1483
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,660
God, obviously.

1484
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,380
I feel like Tracy Chapman had a hand in this somehow.

1485
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,380
Tracy Chapman did, maybe we swap

1486
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,980
Tracy Chapman number two

1487
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,700
for just being such a talented,

1488
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,300
heartbreakingly good songwriter.

1489
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:19,800
Yeah.

1490
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:25,780
Rob Thomas 2A for dropping the ball with Matchbox 20,

1491
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,220
just like letting that whole shit,

1492
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,580
maybe we're all to blame for Matchbox 20

1493
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,780
not being the prominent force in media.

1494
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,060
Yeah, why didn't we appreciate them

1495
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,100
as much as we should have?

1496
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,260
Everyone else, that's not me.

1497
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,420
Every review you read of their albums is just like,

1498
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,620
I wish it was, why isn't it Matchbox 30 or 40?

1499
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,460
And it's like, can you focus on the fucking music

1500
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,220
instead of talking about how the number could be higher?

1501
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,260
We're smooth too, the sequel to Smooth,

1502
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,980
we're all waiting.

1503
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,580
And God, number one, and I guess Yelp

1504
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,420
for not telling me that there would be a review.

1505
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,300
I blame a lot of people.

1506
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:53,800
Yeah.

1507
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,780
Do you guys feel like Matchbox 20

1508
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,820
is like getting some heat again?

1509
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,780
It's getting some heat again.

1510
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,180
A lot of people are talking about Smooth.

1511
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,460
A lot of people talk about Smooth

1512
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,620
and I feel like we've rounded the bin.

1513
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,940
Like, remember when Dwight started listening

1514
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,060
to Billy Joel as a joke

1515
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,660
and then he got really into Billy Joel,

1516
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,500
I feel like we're all making that Billy Joel switch

1517
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,260
with Matchbox 20.

1518
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,540
We're kind of appreciating that like,

1519
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,220
they did have some pretty fucking good songs

1520
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,460
and they didn't make a lot of sense, like lyrically,

1521
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,300
but there are still some pretty good tunes.

1522
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,580
I've been on board with MV20 since day one.

1523
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,260
I found them, here's a little,

1524
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,620
this might be controversial,

1525
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,260
but as much as I love Dave Matthews Band,

1526
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,420
I found Matchbox 20 to be a solid,

1527
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,140
if not better, Dave Matthews Band alternative.

1528
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,700
Like someone who maybe is lactose intolerant

1529
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,620
and they only drink almond milk.

1530
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,580
Matchbox 20 is the almond milk of music.

1531
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,860
Do you know who was in Cincinnati last night,

1532
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,900
just a scant month before Travis is to make his home there?

1533
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,780
Why, it's Rob Thomas and Counting Crows.

1534
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,500
I would have destroyed that show.

1535
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,340
Shit, that's a good lineup.

1536
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,540
It's a good lineup.

1537
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,900
I would have crushed that show.

1538
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,420
What if those two forces get together

1539
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,580
and they start a band called Matchbox 30

1540
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,420
and the OG crew of Matchbox 20 is like,

1541
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,260
yo Rob, yo Bobby, yo Bobby Tom, what's going on?

1542
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,580
You can't just do that to me and us,

1543
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,260
the rest of the band Matchbox 20.

1544
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,980
And Rob Thomas is like,

1545
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,580
I don't even know you guys anymore,

1546
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,460
but that's true because he's in a fugue state

1547
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,020
where he can no longer remember Matchbox 20

1548
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,980
and I'm worried about him.

1549
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,100
Did Carlos Santana cast a memory spell on him?

1550
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,140
That's all I wanna know.

1551
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,380
And for a while he was just a show creator

1552
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,740
and he made Veronica Mars and they were like,

1553
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,940
come back to music and he's like,

1554
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,820
I don't know what you're talking about,

1555
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,100
I've always been a show creator

1556
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,740
because of a weird curse that Carlos Santana put on him.

1557
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,860
He played the forbidden riff.

1558
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,700
Super quick update from the Wikipedia page of Matchbox 20,

1559
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,380
not reading any facts this time,

1560
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,060
just wanna say they have that timeline

1561
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,940
that shows when everybody was in the band and what have you,

1562
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,340
and it extends to 2017,

1563
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:06,180
which I feel like is maybe getting a little bit above.

1564
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,660
It's like the Mayan calendar of Wikipedia pages.

1565
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,020
Rob Thomas I think will probably go on there and say,

1566
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,060
okay, yeah, yeah, probably, I mean, yes, yes, true.

1567
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,020
In February 2017, there's gonna be the great cataclysm,

1568
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,940
but then Rob Thomas is gonna get back in the group

1569
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,900
and be like, guys, time for the smooth sequel, Smooth 2.

1570
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,660
It's still a hot one.

1571
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,580
It's a hot- Like six inches on the midday sun.

1572
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,260
It's a hot one again.

1573
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,140
And you're still like the ocean.

1574
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,460
So this has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1575
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,180
It's an advice show.

1576
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,500
I would like to know if it's still a hot one though.

1577
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,940
I mean, global warming's really just going buck wild

1578
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,860
and I think it just like Rob Thomas has a sort of a responsibility.

1579
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,140
I did wanna tell everybody before we get into all the stuff

1580
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,100
we gotta talk about real quick.

1581
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,540
I guess this is one of the stuffs.

1582
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:08,820
So Wednesday, September 7th, 7 p.m., Joseph Beth Booksellers.

1583
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,580
I am going in Cincinnati, Ohio.

1584
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,580
I'm going to be there moderating a discussion

1585
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,260
with the co-creators and authors of Welcome to Night Vale,

1586
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:22,740
Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor that should be really fun.

1587
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,780
I really love Night Vale

1588
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,460
and it should promise us to be an illuminating discussion

1589
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,300
despite my participation in it.

1590
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,420
I'll probably be there too,

1591
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,980
but I'll just be like looking at books and drinking coffee

1592
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,220
and just like hanging out in Joe Beth.

1593
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,180
I've missed Joe Beth.

1594
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:46,180
So there's more information on that at welcometonightvale.com.

1595
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,060
And anyway, that's 7 p.m., September 7th.

1596
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,940
If you're around that area in Cincinnati,

1597
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,940
you should come on out

1598
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:00,020
because I think that it'll be really fun, personally, I think.

1599
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,780
Sure.

1600
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,180
For me.

1601
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,220
Yeah.

1602
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,220
And if you're in the LA, just another quick plug,

1603
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,460
if you're in the LA area, September 22nd,

1604
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,300
our friend Kate Leth is gonna be doing a similar gig with them.

1605
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,500
So it should be pretty cool.

1606
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,100
And if you're in the LA area right now,

1607
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,780
just go to Travis's fucking place

1608
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,300
and get you some patio furniture.

1609
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,180
I guarantee you're gonna love it.

1610
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,700
I'll give it to you for 25 bucks.

1611
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,780
You won't do it on the free skis, huh?

1612
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,260
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1613
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,060
for the use of our theme song,

1614
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,900
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1615
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,020
It's a great song, great album.

1616
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,900
I want to thank the Max Fun Network for having us.

I think you all are really gonna like it.

1632
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,820
We've been trying as we've been like talking about it

1633
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,460
to think like what would our listeners like above all?

1634
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,820
And I'm very excited about it.

1635
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,940
I can't wait to get started.

1636
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,660

No, we're not gonna do that.

1640
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,540
All right, here we go with the final Yahoo.

1641
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,780
But you could do that if you, I'm just saying like you could.

1642
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,060
Final Yahoo is sent in by Morgan Davies Yahoo Gravy.

1643
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,140
Boy, I hope we don't forget about that by the next episode.

1644
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,180
How could we?

1645
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,420
It's from a non-Yahoo answers user.

1646
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,420
It's something's gone wrong.

1647
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,260
Column Canada asks,

1648
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,380
