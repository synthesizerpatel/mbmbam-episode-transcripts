1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello, heroes. Those who have followed us through the veil, through the void,

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,560
and have come out on the other end as champions, you have completed the Maximum Fun Jar for 2011,

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,480
and we reached our goal with the help of you, and you, and you, and you, and you.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,000
But not that guy in the back. Fuck that guy.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
God damn it, Tave. Just once. Just once pitch in.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
Did you say- Did you say Tave?

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,880
Tave. My friend Tave.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
Is that short for Taven?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,720
It's short for Tavian, actually. Tave-tion. It's like a-

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm actually- I can't be mad at that guy. That poor guy with that poor name.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,360
And listen, the English- the teacher at the community college isn't paying the bills like

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,400
it used to, and Tave-tion just likes to listen to the show. Who can blame him?

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
This is my brother. My brother meets a device show for the modern era. He's listening to us,

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,960
so he knows how to improve his own situation, so he'll be fiscally in a position to help out

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
next year when we call upon his aid. But let's not dwell on that. Let's dwell on

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,960
right now when I am Justin McElroy. And I am Travis McElroy.

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,320
And right now, I am Griffin McElroy. For the foreseeable future,

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
this is my brother, my brother, and me. So let's get right to the wisdom.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,960
So if I, a dude, goes into the bathroom and all the urinals are taken, socially acceptable

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,680
in working order or otherwise, what am I supposed to do?

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Wait around for a urinal to become available? Go outside again and try later? Take a stall?

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,120
If I take a stall, should I close and or lock the doors? Much obliged. Potentially harm.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
Why wouldn't you close the door?

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,360
I don't know, because it's like you're sort of claiming that as your own, as your property.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
You're, you're, you're staking your claim, and maybe you feel like you don't have a right to.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
You take a wide dominant stance.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
You're saying, hey, this is mine now.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
I mean, there's, there, there's, if you'll forgive the pun,

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
there's, there's squatters rights that you have in a, in a bathroom stall.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
If you post up in a bathroom stall, that's,

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,640
that's basically your apartment for the duration of your, your onesie or doosie.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Like I think, I think the moment though, that you're afraid of, if you're peeing in a bathroom

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,000
stall and then you walk out and in the time that you were in the stall, all the urinals cleared out,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,320
you look like a douche when someone's waiting to poop.

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,000
And also everyone just thinks you're trying to hide your tiny dick.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Yeah. Why? What do you, what's your shame? What's, what's wrong with you?

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,960
As you walk into the stall announced, listen, this isn't because I have a tiny dick.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,760
This isn't a shame thing.

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,800
All the urinals are taken.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,160
And my dick's not even big. Like it's average.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,760
I don't, I, listen, I have an average dick, but I need to, I like to say-

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
I just really need to pee.

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
Why don't you just wait it out?

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Like what's the rush?

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,520
I think if somebody wants to shoot one, they will wait, they'll go around you.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
It's not a big deal.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,520
I used to be afraid of using the urinal, not because I have a tiny dick, but just because I

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,680
don't, I just don't want anybody to see my dick.

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm like, that seems like if there's any, any given point during my day,

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,320
that I were to highlight as most likely to get my dick seen,

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,480
I would say that using the urinal is, is like number one, maybe number two on that list.

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Right. And also you, you run the risk of splash damage.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
Splash damage is bad.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,320
And also I might see other dude's dicks and that, psychologically, that's, that's even worse for me.

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,480
So I used to use the stall.

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm, I've gotten over that fear, but I'm sure there are other people who still suffer from it.

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,960
And to those people, I'm saying that you're, you're completely within reason.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah.

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,440
The stall or just wait and use the bathroom at home like a normal person.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
But like a human being.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Let's throw, slap a motto on this bitch.

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's make it marketable.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,640
Okay.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Yeah.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,440
Go your own way.

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
I gotta get some rights.

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
What about this?

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
What about this?

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,160
If there's no stall, you need to stall.

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
Okay.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Is that, is that, does that have some possibilities, you think?

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
That definitely has some possibilities.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
I think no matter what, it's an intimate moment.

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
What you, what you do in a bathroom.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,400
I can't think of an un-intimate thing that one would normally do in a bathroom.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,480
And it's uncomfortable sharing that moment with other people.

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
So just, you know, it sucks.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
You gotta get through it.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,160
But stalls, I think, are the best place to do it.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
Guys, I was lying in bed with, laying in bed with my girlfriend.

85
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
Sorry, Griffin.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,000
And I asked her the age, if you could have sex with anyone, who would it be?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Oh, the age old, if you could have sex with anyone.

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
There is an age that you can have sex with people.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,320
What is the age of anyone you could have sex with?

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
18, by the way.

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Young enough to be legal, still in the prime, obvious.

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
Her answer was XBF or 50.

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Because what's up?

94
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
Her answer was her XBF because it was so good and passionate.

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I got cranky, rolled over and went to sleep.

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
She's now angry at me, saying it doesn't mean anything and it was no big deal.

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,400
Help.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Terry, Terry.

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,040
Is Terry asking how to get over this girl that he just broke up with because she said that thing?

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,600
This girl that he definitely, definitely just dumped.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
See, the answer to that question is supposed to be like Shakira or Natalie Portman.

102
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
It's not supposed to be your friend Jeff.

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,760
Your fucking brother.

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,240
Like, no.

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,480
You're not allowed to do that.

106
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,560
And note to guys, if your lady asks you this question, the answer is her.

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
The answer is always her.

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,080
Can I get-

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Crap.

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Can I get you with red hair?

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,840
Is that-

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,280
Can I get you minus, let's call it eight pounds.

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
Like, I think right there would get you in the sweet spot for me.

114
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
You on a good day.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Yeah, no, she done fucked up, Terry.

116
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,760
And might I say, Terry, as one man speaking to another, what a moment this is for you.

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,200
Because it's rare that girls fuck up this clearly.

118
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,120
Like, this obviously.

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Guys, all the time.

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Like, if we get this question from a girl, I think the-

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't think we'd be so-

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
It probably wouldn't be worth reading.

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Her answer was a one-two punch, fuck you.

124
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,320
Because it like, it was so bad.

125
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,680
Fuck you, because it like, it was so good.

126
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
Like, number one, it was so good.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
Like, fuck, I can't fuck like that.

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
Like, I can't fuck like Jerry.

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
I can't fuck like Jerry.

130
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Like, I'm pretty good, but I'm not Jerry good.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Not only was it fucking good, it was passionate.

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Those are the two key elements to good, good fucking.

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,120
Because it's gotta, like, there's gotta be technical ability behind it.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,600
There's also gotta be a little something, a little extra spice, a little love.

135
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,120
A little bit of dance, you gotta know the craft, but the heart's gotta be there, too.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
He was good at loving me.

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,440
Jerry was.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Back in the long, long ago.

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
Terry, I don't know what to tell you, man.

140
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
You done been wronged.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
You've been wronged.

142
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,520
You need to be angry at her for the foreseeable future.

143
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Yeah, why the fuck is she angry at you?

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,480
Why are you even thinking about this?

145
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,480
Jerry, Terry, Terry, Terry.

146
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Oh, for the rest of your relationship, which I imagine will be about two weeks,

147
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,920
whenever you guys get into a fight, just yell at her about her mind fucking her ex-boyfriend.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah, and you're with Jerry right now, aren't you?

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,040
In your heart, you're with Jerry still.

150
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Not Terry, me Terry, not me, but Jerry.

151
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,040
I know it's confusing.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,200
I know it's confusing, but you're with Jerry in your heart.

153
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Recently, I was-

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
You want a yahoo instead of the thing you're doing?

155
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,920
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's why I started reading it.

156
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,080
This one was sent in by Nick Jensen.

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,880
Thank you, Nick Jensen.

158
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,360
Hey, Nick.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Hey, it's by Yahoo Answers user, Dean Windass, all right, who asks,

160
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,200
girls, what would you do if you accidentally sat on your ex?

161
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
If it was your worst ex and you went to sit down on a chair

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,520
and it was your ex's face that had been transformed into the seat of the chair

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,120
by some magic experiment gone wrong, when you sat down,

164
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,800
his nose went up your bum like this, and then-

165
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Like what?

166
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
And then Dean Windass has included two parentheses,

167
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
marks that are facing inward to each other,

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
which I guess is supposed to be a butt crack.

169
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,800
My butt crack doesn't, I don't know, it's not beveled.

170
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
Is that the right word?

171
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Although my butt crack is where I keep asides.

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,320
Yeah.

173
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
So there were like parentheses in that sense.

174
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
Well, what would you say when you realized it was him?

175
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
This is a survey.

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
Cool, cool.

177
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,280
Cool.

178
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Hey, did you guys recognize this as a survey?

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,120
2010 census, I must have missed this one.

180
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
What would you do if your face was-

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
Like this is-

182
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
First off, I don't know where the first off is.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Your boyfriend's face was transformed.

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Was the rest of him transformed into a chair too?

185
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
I mean, is that what we have to-

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
This is a left, right?

187
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,960
This is a person chair.

188
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
I'm thinking about that old lady from Doctor Who

189
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
who gets her face stressed out.

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,520
I think just that and let's just throw that on a love seat.

191
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
This chair looks like Jerry.

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
Terry, did you turn Jerry into a chair

193
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
and trick me into sitting on it?

194
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I like that he had to add the extra component of

195
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
it's your worst ex as though if it were anyone else,

196
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
that would be completely fine.

197
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,120
Hey, honey, hey, sweetheart, if you could sit on anyone's face

198
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
who was turned into a chair by some magic experiment gone wrong.

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
And also their nose would go up your butt like this.

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,120
And you make parentheses with your hands.

201
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
Mine is George Lopez.

202
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
I like his comedy, but he also seems like a really good dad.

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah, and his skin is taut and leathery.

204
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
And I like a chair with some firm support.

205
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
George Lopez, your face is very comfortable to sit on.

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, I'm not a fan of your work,

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
but I am enjoying sitting on your face.

208
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
It's like massage beads that taxi drivers use.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
If I had a chair that the seat of which was composed

210
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,520
of George Lopez's face,

211
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,920
can I call it Beverly Hills Chair Wawa?

212
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,600
I think so.

213
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
I think that that would be more than acceptable.

214
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,360
Can I make a movie called Beverly Hills Chair Wawa

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
that's just a bunch of chairs instead of dogs?

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,420
Yeah.

217
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
I can do both of those things, but will I?

218
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,360
Probably not.

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm a busy guy.

220
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm afraid Stuart getting transformed

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
into a chair would actually be a bump for him.

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
That would be a big up.

223
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
To go from whatever he's doing now.

224
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,280
Whatever the fuck it is he's doing to be a chair.

225
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
So I guess that answers that.

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,280
What a fucking weird...

227
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,920
How about this?

228
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
How about this Yahoo answer?

229
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
What do I do when I read a question

230
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,280
from someone who's obviously insane?

231
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
Like obviously mentally unstable

232
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
that this is what they're pondering.

233
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Diamond Mayweather responded and said,

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
I'd jump up, apologize, then move to another seat.

235
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
Well, of course.

236
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Being more careful this time to check

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,000
to make sure it's not a person.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And then send them a polite sympathy note.

239
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,600
Jerry.

240
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
Cherry, I'm so sorry.

241
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,920
Cherry.

242
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,200
Please forgive me.

243
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm gonna move over to that seat.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
It's got George Lopez's face on it.

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,520
Which I believe my tuchus will prefer.

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,920
9 out of 10 tuchuses prefer George Lopez's face

247
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
to Terry or Jerry.

248
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,480
See, Jerry?

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
That's an area that Terry can compete with Jerry in.

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Face comfort.

251
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
I have a friend named Badkins.

252
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
I think he's probably listening to this right now.

253
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,080
And he has this great pickup line

254
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,600
where whenever he's at a bar or a party

255
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,480
or something like that,

256
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
he doesn't do this all the time.

257
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
I don't want to make him sound like a grosso.

258
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
But if a girl comes over and is like,

259
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
hey, can I have a seat?

260
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
And he says, sure.

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,440
He takes his glasses off and wipes his face down.

262
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
I have to say, here you go.

263
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,880
This is where it goes.

264
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Pretty good.

265
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,400
That's pretty good.

266
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
It probably never panned out.

267
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
It's still just rife with comedy.

268
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah.

269
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
Never worked.

270
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Someday.

271
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,880
Keep the faith.

272
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
Recently I was volunteering at an event.

273
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,600
I hit it off with a girl I was working with.

274
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
I decided to ask her out to coffee

275
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
but put off to the last minute.

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
By the time I was going to ask her,

277
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,240
she was with a friend

278
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,640
and it felt weird asking her around her friend

279
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,280
and even weirder calling her away from her friend.

280
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,880
I didn't end up asking her out.

281
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
My question is,

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
were those even borderline reasonable

283
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
or just poor excuses and bad habits?

284
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,160
Thanks, Mitch.

285
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,240
I believe that.

286
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Thanks, comma, Mitch.

287
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,840
Thanks, Mitch.

288
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,560
I think that those,

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
they seem like good excuses at the time

290
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
but I think that it would be just absolutely like bawling

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
if you just walked up and said,

292
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,400
listen, sorry to interrupt

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,160
and just asked her right in front of a friend.

294
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,960
I think it would show like huge confidence

295
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,840
and like, I think it would be a great start.

296
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
She would, if you got the guts to do it,

297
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,600
she's going to look awesome in front of her friend.

298
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
What person doesn't want that?

299
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,080
I disagree.

300
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,320
Uh-oh, that's rude.

301
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,960
What are you going to do?

302
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
Roll up there, be like, clam up.

303
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,880
It's me time.

304
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe not that,

305
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,160
but you know, just walk over and say,

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,640
I'm about to take off.

307
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm sorry to interrupt.

308
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,480
I just wanted to see

309
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
if maybe you wanted to grab coffee sometime.

310
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,200
Who wants to be pursued demurely though?

311
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,280
Who wants, who doesn't want that passion,

312
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,160
that fire there?

313
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,960
So maybe just like run up and yell,

314
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,800
clam up and push her friend out.

315
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,760
I've been trying to wait.

316
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,280
I can't risk, you know, losing this opportunity.

317
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
I love you and I want to get married to you.

318
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
And then if she says no,

319
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
turn to her friend and say,

320
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,840
how about you?

321
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,320
How about you?

322
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,640
Yeah, maybe just the old eeny meeny miny moe.

323
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm just laying them out on the table.

324
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
As long as they're out here,

325
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
would you like to pick them up?

326
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
I mean, as long as I'm laying them out for you.

327
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
Trying to catch a sweet baby by the toe over here.

328
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,320
Eeny, meeny, miny.

329
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
Who gives a rat's ass?

330
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Let's both do it.

331
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,840
Let's go, ladies.

332
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,440
You and me, arm and arm.

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,200
Sex party, my place.

334
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
Show you my eeny, meeny.

335
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
You want to hook up to,

336
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
you want to hit up with CJ Maggies?

337
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's hit the O'Charlies.

338
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Get some, get some onion fringes.

339
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Just get down.

340
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
But at the end of the day,

341
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,760
don't ever call someone away from their friend

342
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,400
to ask them out,

343
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,480
because you look like an absolute creeper.

344
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
Excuse me, just come,

345
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
just step over here real quick.

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
I have something private to ask you.

347
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm not sure you look like a creeper, though.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
I don't think that's fair.

349
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
I think that it just makes you seem like

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
asking a man out is something

351
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
you're incredibly embarrassed about,

352
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
and something that you wouldn't ever want anyone

353
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,000
to know you were doing.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
I think it's creepy.

355
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
Hey, I have hemorrhoids,

356
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
and also I like you.

357
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,000
I like you very much.

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,040
Don't tell Debra.

359
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,080
Don't tell Debra over there.

360
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Don't tell Debra, but we're in love.

361
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
She's got judgey eyes.

362
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
I hang out with six to seven people

363
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
every Saturday night.

364
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,480
It's a busy night.

365
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
We all go over to someone's house,

366
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
and then have dinner,

367
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
and play games and whatnot.

368
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
Two of these people are vegetarians.

369
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
When I go to their houses,

370
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
I don't mind eating their vegetarian nonsense,

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
but when they're coming over to my house,

372
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,840
should I have to go out of my way

373
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
to make some sort of vegetarian dish?

374
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Or should I tell them to fend for themselves

375
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
as they would have done in the olden timey days?

376
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,100
Ryan.

377
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,740
It sounds like he should revise

378
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,020
the beginning of his question and say,

379
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,460
I hang out with four to five friends

380
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,420
every Saturday night,

381
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,340
and one to two vegetarian acquaintances.

382
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Occasionally, after dinner,

383
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,260
they join with us.

384
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,740
What I love about this is the idea

385
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,860
of some sort of vegetarian dish.

386
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,540
Do you know what's a vegetarian dish?

387
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,580
Vegetables.

388
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,860
Like a salad.

389
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,460
That's vegetarian right there.

390
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,960
What?

391
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,760
What?

392
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,180
First of all,

393
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,540
that's wildly wrong.

394
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,580
Everything you just said.

395
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,780
There's so much other food that vegetarians eat.

396
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,220
You're disqualifying yourself.

397
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,420
Do you eat salads?

398
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,060
Not everybody.

399
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,020
Yeah bitch, but like bread too, stupid.

400
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,220
Like what are you talking about?

401
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,180
Travis puts like chorizo sausage

402
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,020
on like two out of three meals of the day.

403
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,660
Your opinion when it comes to vegetarian matters

404
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,700
just don't count.

405
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,200
True.

406
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,060
What I'm curious about is

407
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,980
is how telling them to fend for themselves

408
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,620
in your apartment.

409
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,120
Like,

410
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,660
like hey there's some compost out back.

411
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,620
Like go nuts.

412
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,740
Go wacky back there.

413
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,540
Maybe grow some some bok choy.

414
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,820
You're gonna love it.

415
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,580
You're gonna love the fertile soils back there.

416
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,580
I think that if you're,

417
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,060
if you're picking a dinner

418
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,580
that you're gonna make for people,

419
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,420
I think that you shouldn't go out of your way

420
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,860
to make something for them,

421
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,820
but I think you should go out of your way

422
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,860
to make something,

423
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,580
not go out of your way,

424
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,460
but try to choose a dish

425
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,100
that would be easily convertible.

426
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,580
You know what I mean?

427
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,660
Don't serve meat noodles, for example,

428
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,780
would be right out.

429
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,900
That's a thing?

430
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,180
Yeah, sure.

431
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,900
Honestly, yeah.

432
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,860
Build your own,

433
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,060
like do a pasta thing

434
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,300
where you like you add whatever you want to it.

435
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,940
That way people could do like,

436
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,740
you know, meatballs

437
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,020
or they can just do the sauce

438
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,820
or whatever they want

439
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,900
and that way it fits everybody's lifestyle.

440
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,540
Do you think that Travis calls sausage meat noodles?

441
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,580
That's basically what they are

442
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,620
in a mind like his.

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,380
A beautiful mind.

444
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,340
Beautiful mind.

445
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,380
Like Russell Crowe on Russell Graham's movie.

446
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,420
What?

447
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,860
He did a movie,

448
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,300
it's called Beautiful Mind.

449
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,340
Oh, that one.

450
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,860
I didn't see it.

452
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,260
Yeah, somebody did.

453
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,180
Yeah, so I would serve something

454
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,140
that's like convertible,

455
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,860
that's easy to take the meat out.

456
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,580
Something easy to remove the meat from.

457
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,540
And I'd go with a syringe or whatever.

458
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,780
Don't like chicken cordon bleu

459
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,900
and just give him a pile of breadcrumbs

460
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,620
and some cheese.

461
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,180
You guys eat croutons, right?

462
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,140
Here's a bowl of croutons.

463
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,420
It's what you people eat, right?

464
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,140
Travis told me you guys just eat vegetables.

465
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,620
That's it.

466
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,740
But yeah, I would.

467
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,660
That's the way I would go.

468
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,100
Hey, Griffin.

469
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,600
Hey, Will.

470
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,660
You ready to take a trip with me?

471
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,540
I mean, I just,

472
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,940
I've still got the stink of the sky on me

473
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,220
because my plane just landed.

474
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,020
Your sky stink?

475
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,740
I've got a bit of sky stink still left on me,

476
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,260
but yeah, sure.

477
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,380
Let's go on a trip.

478
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,260
Where to?

479
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:15,860
The money zone.

480
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,360
Okay.

481
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,780
So we're there?

482
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,100
Is this-

483
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,820
We're there.

484
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,220
We're here.

485
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,380
Are we there?

486
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,220
This is nice.

487
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,940
This is nice.

488
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm comfortable.

489
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,740
The chairs are much more expensive here.

490
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,140
Is this-

491
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,980
I believe it is George Lopez's face.

492
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,100
So what we want to talk with you guys about

493
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,460
is something that is close to mine and Griffin's hearts

494
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,660
and Travis, I suppose.

495
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,020
That's video games.

496
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,700
It's so rare we get to talk about video games here.

497
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,820
My brother and my brother and me.

498
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,860
And today we're talking about one called Kingdom of Loathing

499
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,420
or KOL if you're down.

500
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,980
Or KOL if you pronounce your O's weird.

501
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,260
If you pronounce your O's wrong, then it's KOL.

502
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,180
Now this is made by our friends at Asymmetric Publications,

503
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,140
including the creator Zach Jick Johnson

504
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,340
and the writer Josh Mr. Skullhead Knight.

505
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,380
Josh Knight, I don't think you needed a nickname,

506
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,060
but I think it's all right that you chose-

507
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,620
No, no, no.

508
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,140
That's his Christian.

509
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,580
That's his proper name.

510
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,460
His mom and dad named him Josh Mr. Skullhead Knight.

511
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,620
Josh Mr. Skullhead, all hyphenated first name.

512
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,380
That was his baptismal name.

513
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,540
That's the name he was given upon confirmation.

514
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,180
Sure, sure.

515
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
He was named after Pope Mr. Skullhead.

516
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,860
I don't think this is a hand-drawn stick figure graphics.

517
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,100
Right.

518
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,340
It has some surreal humor, some word play.

519
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,180
Don't let the stick figure thing turn you off

520
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,340
because these are some high quality stick figures.

521
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,620
Yeah, I mean, you could tell the definitions there.

522
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,500
Even though they may be stick figures,

523
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,100
you feel the emotion, you feel the passion.

524
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,700
How many pixels does it support?

525
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,820
Easily a billion.

526
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,340
How many megs of RAM car mine?

527
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,300
There's probably a lot.

528
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,500
They have tons of players.

529
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,300
I was turned on to this game and played it for a while

530
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,580
in college way back when.

531
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,700
It's been around for like eight years.

532
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,540
And it's still going strong.

533
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,260
Now, Griffin, I like online multiplayer RPGs,

534
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,780
but I don't have a lot of cash.

535
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,900
Is that going to be a problem?

536
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,860
It is going to be a problem with other parts of your life

537
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,220
because you need cash.

538
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,300
We exchange cash for goods and services

539
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,620
in this capitalist society that we all live in.

540
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,140
But to play cool, or if you want kingdom of loathing,

541
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,500
you don't need a goddamn motherfucking penny, bitch.

542
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,900
It's a free to play, a free as shit, I think should be the name.

543
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,940
Free as shit.

544
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,740
And it's free as fuck, like so free.

545
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,980
It's been in development for eight years

546
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,140
with literally, we're told, tens of thousands of dumb jokes.

547
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,060
We have not counted them ourselves,

548
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,820
but that is what we are led to believe.

549
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,260
I have played it before.

550
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,300
It is, it's funny.

551
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,140
And it's not funny in that way of like,

552
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,740
it's not like internet meme funny.

553
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,900
It's like, it's just funny.

554
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,020
Like it's a funny game.

555
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,740
And you know what?

556
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,060
Not only is it free, you play it in your web browser.

557
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,540
Like they could not have made this game easier to access

558
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,860
unless they came to your house

559
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,620
and put it in some sort of syringe

560
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,940
and like jam it in your eyes.

561
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,740
Johnny Mnemonic.

562
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,060
It's got a cool community

563
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
and you filled with a lot of neat people

564
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,740
and you can join them right now.

565
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,220
You can just push some buttons on your keyboard.

566
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,020
You will be whisked away to said kingdom.

567
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,900
Tell us the exact sequence of buttons, please.

568
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:49,220
K-I-N-G-D-O-M-O-F-L-O-A-T-H-I-N-G, period.

569
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,540
C-O-M, enter key.

570
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,580
Or kingdomofloathing.com would also work

571
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,260
if you're not into putting letters together.

572
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,340
But go check them out.

573
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,780
Yeah, totally.

574
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,740
And as a special treat for anybody

575
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,220
who decides to do a promotion on our show,

576
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,660
which if you want to do one,

577
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,500
email Teresa at maximumfun.org

578
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,780
and she'll give you the hot deets.

579
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,580
You get a jingle.

580
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,860
All the best jingles have an intro, right?

581
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,140
Which all the best jingles have a smooth, smooth segue,

582
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,660
which this is one of.

583
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,340
Let's see.

584
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,900
I didn't pre-pro this one.

585
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,740
This is not going good, I don't think, Griffin.

586
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:39,300
K-I-N-G-D-O-M-O-F-L-O-A-T-H-I-N-G, period.

587
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,540
I need adventure and sticks.

588
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,620
I don't have money to acquire the adventure and sticks

589
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,820
I talked about.

590
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,140
I'll go to cool.com.

591
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,940
I can't go to cool.com

592
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,380
because that is something else I'll go to kingdomofloathing.com.

593
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,900
Kingdomofloathing.com.

594
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,820
Check it totally out.

595
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
So, wait, wait, wait.

596
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,580
Yes, one of my closest friends is full of hatred.

597
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,700
She's a really great person and I just love her guts,

598
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,900
but it's hard to constantly be around such negativity.

599
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,100
Stay posy, our friend Justin Russo always says.

600
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,700
But anyway, don't get me wrong.

601
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,060
Every now and then it's nice to have someone to vent with,

602
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,860
but believe me when I say nobody wants that all the time.

603
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,580
I don't know if she gets off on bitching about people or what,

604
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,020
but lately I've taken to saying,

605
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,100
can we just not talk about this right now?

606
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,260
And it's like she doesn't even hear me.

607
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,620
She completely ignores it.

608
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,940
I've explained it to her before.

609
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,780
She just doesn't seem to realize that it's exhausting

610
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,220
to be around someone so angry all the time.

611
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,300
Like I said, she's a valued friend

612
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,980
and I just wish this one thing was different.

613
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,100
Suggestions, how to with hate.

614
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,260
Wait, no, no, let me try again.

615
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,700
Suggestions, suggestions, how to with hate.

616
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,100
This is rough, man.

617
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,220
I can think of one or two friends off the top of my head

618
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,900
that I just stopped hanging out with

619
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,420
because they just brought me down all the time

620
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,260
because it's all they talked about was negative shit.

621
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,260
That's not just one thing that's wrong with them.

622
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,100
Like if you are a categorically negative person,

623
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,820
that affects every single aspect of your life

624
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,940
and it makes you not pleasant to be around generally.

625
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,660
Yeah, a lot of times I think the only way to go

626
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,580
is like intervention kind of thing

627
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,260
because I don't think there's anything,

628
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,660
it doesn't sound like there's anything you're doing

629
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,940
that makes her hate everyone.

630
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,180
So it's not like a behavior you have to change,

631
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,900
but maybe going to where I'm like-

632
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,940
I don't wanna sound like a downer,

633
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,460
but I don't know how you intervene with that.

634
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,900
Like how do you tell somebody like,

635
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,900
hey, completely change your whole worldview, please.

636
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,500
You know how you got this worldview?

637
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,860
Can you just flip that?

638
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,380
Just put that to R for me.

639
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,620
Can you bust that worldview out and flip it

640
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,820
and then reverse it?

641
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,900
Well, I think it's a matter of saying to her like,

642
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,740
hey, listen, you might not see it

643
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,100
because you're so close to it,

644
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,860
but you complain all the time.

645
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,380
You might wanna take a look at like your mental process

646
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,140
and figure out why you're so unhappy.

647
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,300
And once you do, get back to me.

648
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,220
It's hard to be with you right now.

649
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,500
It's hard to be around you right now

650
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,660
because you are such a negative person.

651
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,020
And I think you probably owe them that.

652
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,260
I think you owe it to them to say,

653
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,260
listen, I just can't take the negativity all the time

654
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,420
because that'll get up in you.

655
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,460
That will affect you and affect your day-to-day.

656
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,660
It'll build a home inside you.

657
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,340
Absolutely.

658
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,580
It's like that giant song,

659
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,780
make a little bird house in your soul,

660
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,820
except it's not a bird house.

661
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,420
It's like a shit house.

662
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,540
It's like an outhouse.

663
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,140
She's pooping in your heart is what I'm saying.

664
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,540
And you'll get septic if you let her keep doing it.

665
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,500
Especially if like everybody else sees that too

666
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,980
and all of a sudden now you're also getting associated

667
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,140
with the negativity because you're with her all the time.

668
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,820
So there's a certain amount of like,

669
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,780
it just seems like a really like negative influence

670
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,300
in your life on a lot of levels.

671
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,820
In fact, you know what?

672
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,540
It's so negative.

673
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,620
I say, let's go on the next question

674
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,980
because it's bringing me down.

675
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,460
Yeah.

676
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,420
I feel like I'm getting my heart shit in now.

677
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,580
Yeah.

678
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,820
Why are you shitting in Ditto's heart?

679
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,460
Come on.

680
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,500
Don't shit in his heart.

681
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
Look what your friend is doing now.

682
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,340
You need better reason to cut ties?

683
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,780
Shitting Griffin's heart.

684
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,660
That heart's already full of blood and egg yolk.

685
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,180
Griffin, you got a Yahoo for me?

686
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,220
I got like four.

687
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,420
How about this?

688
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,260
I guess this one was sent in by Metal Gear Jim,

689
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,540
which wasn't his Twitter name.

690
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
That was his actual name on like on the email.

691
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,420
So maybe it's by Yahoo Answers user John who asks,

692
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,420
could I take Tyra Banks?

693
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,580
John is five foot five, 130 pounds.

694
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,380
And I don't work out.

695
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,140
My GF just said that I wouldn't have a chance against Tyra.

696
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,340
Hmm.

697
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,460
What's the scrappiness?

698
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,660
Is his scrappiness?

699
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,260
It doesn't include his power rating.

700
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,620
Yeah.

701
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,420
Or anything like his special abilities or anything like that.

702
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,340
But I gotta say, even if you were about six inches taller

703
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,060
and like 20 pounds beefier and you did work out,

704
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,580
have you seen how fierce Tyra Banks is?

705
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,780
And look in her eyes.

706
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,860
Plus, there's just her large like collection of knives

707
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,780
that she carries on her person at all times.

708
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,980
Well, yeah.

709
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,060
But we're talking about modeling.

710
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,740
You're just like hand to hand like.

711
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,380
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,660
We're talking about a backstreet brawl.

713
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,700
No chains, no pipes.

714
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,260
Just the fists of a man named John

715
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,660
and the fists of a supermodel named Tyra Banks.

716
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,020
Are there any holds barred?

717
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,340
Let me check.

718
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,940
There is one hold barred.

719
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,260
Okay.

720
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,220
You can't say anything mean about her eyelashes.

721
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,460
Oh.

722
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,780
Actually, that's her weak point.

723
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,740
She's really sensitive.

724
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,340
You also can't bring up the time she spent in Paris

725
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,300
modeling with her mama, going from agency to agency,

726
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,380
trying to find someone who will take her under her wing

727
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,460
because she gets very emotional about that.

728
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,020
She went through some shit in gay Paris

729
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,780
and I think that that hardened her to like-

730
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,580
People tell her,

731
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,740
I've heard her say that, just like that.

732
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,660
Can you translate?

733
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,420
Can you just click Google translation?

734
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,940
I used Google translation that said,

735
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,340
you can't do this.

736
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,540
We don't believe in you.

737
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,380
You have bad eyebrows.

738
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,220
You have bad eyebrows?

739
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,020
Was that the word?

740
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,220
Listen, I know.

741
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,500
That's how they say it in Paris.

742
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,300
The eyebrows, I love your ears.

743
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,580
Listen, Tyra Banks will come at you like a fucking Wolverine.

744
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
Not like Wolverine from X-Men,

745
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,100
like a rabid Wolverine

746
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,820
and also kind of like Wolverine from X-Men.

747
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,500
Like both Wolverine from X-Men

748
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,180
and like a rabid fan of Michigan.

749
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,300
But on the bright side,

750
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,060
like the next day when you see your friends

751
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,980
and they're like, oh my God, what happened to you?

752
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,780
You be like, oh dude, Tyra Banks fucked me up.

753
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,900
She's got reach.

754
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,500
First of all, she's got reach on you

755
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
because she's a tall, beautiful lady.

756
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,860
Her being beautiful has nothing to do with her reach.

757
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,820
I just wanted to go ahead and put out the opinion

758
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,580
that she is in fact an attractive woman.

759
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,700
She's got nails probably, right?

760
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,060
That's safe to assume.

761
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,580
They're probably sharp and just the fierceness.

762
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,340
We can't stress the fierceness enough.

763
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,460
Once you're down on the ground bleeding

764
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,300
like a bloody heap, she's not gonna stop.

765
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,740
She will literally kill you.

766
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,980
Do you think that he could take Tyra Banks

767
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,260
if she were in her fat suit?

768
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,740
Oh, no way.

769
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,700
Are you kidding me?

770
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,220
You could kick her down a flight of stairs

771
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,100
she wouldn't even notice.

772
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,460
Could you take her in her hobo suit?

773
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,020
Yeah, her hobo suit, yes.

774
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Tyra also should be noted has a weave,

775
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,660
which is basically bionics, right?

776
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,060
Unfair.

777
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,020
Man-made integration.

778
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,780
Good news, John, you won.

779
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,900
She got disqualified.

780
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,220
She got disqualified for the use of bionics.

781
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,940
I like my best friend's girlfriend.

782
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,820
I'm not a total douche,

783
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,500
so I'm not gonna try to steal her or anything,

784
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,740
but I wonder how I could stop being interested in her.

785
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,180
I can't talk to her just like another friend

786
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,580
and I can't stop seeing her because of my friend,

787
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,260
says Salazar.

788
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,900
Why are you cheating on your best friend?

789
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,980
Why are you such a...

790
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,660
No, no, no, I see what he's saying.

791
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,220
I get it.

792
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,340
And I don't hear what he's saying

793
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,940
because it sounds to me like he's inception cheating

794
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,500
on his best friend.

795
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,460
Like if you're dreaming about her,

796
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,700
like that shit's in your mind and that counts.

797
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,140
You lost already.

798
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,420
Salazar, I have a suggestion for you,

799
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,380
and that is to try to find faults with her.

800
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,420
Like focus on the bad stuff.

801
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,740
Out loud.

802
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,820
Because sometimes out loud,

803
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,460
try to say like,

804
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
hey, you got shoulders like a quarterback to her

805
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,140
and you can just really,

806
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,060
just sort of throw a pipe bomb in there.

807
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,260
Not literally, of course,

808
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,820
although, I mean, problem solved.

809
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,860
You've got, you've got eyebrows just like Tyra Banks.

810
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,060
You've got T Banks,

811
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,940
I brushes and that's not a compliment.

812
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,740
I don't know what your,

813
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,340
your eyebrow culture is in your area,

814
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,420
but it is not a positive.

815
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,540
I hear what you're saying,

816
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,780
but unfortunately she has no faults.

817
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,420
Oh, so she's so perfect.

818
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
And Salazar is in love with her

819
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,860
and maybe she's in love with him too.

820
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,460
And maybe they have to break that sacred bond

821
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,620
so that they can be happy for the rest of their lives.

822
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,940
Or maybe he could imagine her pooping

823
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,780
because maybe you can imagine her pooping.

824
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,740
See, I didn't want to say that

825
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,100
because we have a pretty strict

826
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,500
non-scatological rule for our show.

827
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,020
But if you can,

828
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,060
if you think I will break that rule to help someone,

829
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,940
but guess what, dog?

830
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:24,980
What if it,

831
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,820
what if you flip it and you imagine her pooping

832
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,780
and then you love it?

833
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,700
Oh God.

834
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,140
Now you have a crush on your boyfriend

835
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,100
and you're dirty.

836
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,940
No one likes you anymore because you're dirty.

837
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,140
Salazar, you're, you're on a tightrope.

838
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,500
I think you should just keep on walking

839
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,900
until you make it to the other perch.

840
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,780
I think you're doing it.

841
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,580
You're already,

842
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,020
well, you're already ahead of the game

843
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,380
because you've already like made the decision

844
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,260
that you're not gonna,

845
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,580
you're not gonna try anything,

846
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,380
which is great.

847
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,740
So, you know.

848
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,220
That's good too.

849
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,500
But if you've like,

850
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,180
the harder you try to not be in,

851
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,500
like, have you never seen a Renee Zellweger movie?

852
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,140
Like the harder you try to not be into her,

853
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,900
the harder you're gonna be into her.

854
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,860
The best thing to do,

855
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,940
and it sucks because it sounds like,

856
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,220
you know, a non-starter,

857
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,620
but you need to just stop thinking about her.

858
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,580
You need to just, it's not gonna happen.

859
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,020
It's not a thing.

860
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,460
He loves her, Travis.

861
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,500
Listen, Salazar,

862
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
have you considered going to her front door

863
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,460
and ringing it?

864
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,900
And also the boyfriend lives there too.

865
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,140
And she comes down and you have a boombox

866
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,540
and you're like,

867
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,500
say it's Carolers.

868
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,980
And she's like,

869
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,860
it's Carolers.

870
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,220
And you hold up signs

871
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
that actually tell her how you feel.

872
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,260
And then when you walk away,

873
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,780
she runs up and she kisses you.

874
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,180
And she says,

875
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,820
Merry Christmas.

876
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,500
She runs back inside and you're like,

877
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,220
okay, I guess I'm not in love with her anymore.

878
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,020
Hey love, actually,

879
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,780
that's a stupid fucking conceit,

880
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,580
by the way.

881
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,660
That's a dumb part of your fucking stupid movie.

882
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,940
I love you so much.

883
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,220
Here's this big romantic gesture.

884
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,020
All right, kiss you.

885
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,980
I don't, we're done.

886
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,660
I'm out.

887
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,300
Peace, dip.

888
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm out, 2011.

889
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,940
I'm out.

890
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,820
I'm done.

891
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,020
Salazar, do all those things

892
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,140
and maybe it'll work.

893
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Yeah, if you learn how to control the human heart,

894
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,980
you get right back to us, friendo.

895
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,260
Hey, would it be out of line for me

896
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,540
to ask your girl for her number

897
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,380
after only the first time I meet her?

898
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,580
What's happened to me a few times

899
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,460
is that I'll ask the girl

900
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,980
if she wants to grab lunch sometime

901
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,660
and then give her my number without asking for her

902
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,700
since I feel like I'm putting her

903
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,220
in a less awkward position.

904
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,420
But most of those times,

905
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,620
they never get back to me,

906
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,500
waiting by the phone.

907
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,660
If you feel like you're putting her

908
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,180
in an awkward position,

909
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,420
why are you speaking to this person?

910
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,500
Like it should be a pleasant thing

911
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,300
to like plan dates and exchange phone numbers.

912
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,500
Waiting by the phone,

913
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,460
you got something to offer.

914
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,380
This isn't a two-way street.

915
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,660
You're not putting anybody

916
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,860
in an awkward position,

917
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,860
offering a chance to go out on a date with you.

918
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,660
You're fun.

919
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,740
It is the year of our Lord, 2011.

920
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,300
Yeah.

921
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,580
Everyone's already connected as fuck, right?

922
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,300
I'm connected to every single person

923
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,980
in some way,

924
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,980
some ways more tangential than others.

925
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,620
Just ask for a fucking number.

926
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,660
It's not like you're asking her

927
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,020
to like move in with you.

928
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,900
You're not asking her

929
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
to like get life insurance policies together.

930
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,580
Is that a thing you can do?

931
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,540
Yes.

932
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,500
I don't know.

933
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,180
Just ask for a number.

934
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,540
What's the big deal?

935
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,660
Maybe you'll call her.

936
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,220
The thing is,

937
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,420
is like giving her your number is really passive.

938
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,460
Like it doesn't cause anything to happen, you know?

939
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,020
But getting her number is an active step

940
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,060
that shows interest

941
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,540
and that you then, you know,

942
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,740
can control the situation

943
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,620
instead of sitting at home

944
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,660
waiting for them to call you.

945
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,540
If she doesn't want to give up your number,

946
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,780
then if she doesn't want to give her a number,

947
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,820
she's not down.

948
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,300
Yeah, she ain't down.

949
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,900
She's just trying to get it to end,

950
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,020
get the time to end.

951
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
And so then you don't have to worry about it.

952
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,100
Like if it's okay to ask her for it or not,

953
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,380
because if she's not down,

954
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,660
then you don't lose anything.

955
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,060
Like you're not going to fail

956
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,660
because she said no.

957
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,180
And you go, okay, well, I tried

958
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:46,980
and you walk away

959
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,660
and you move on to the next attempt.

960
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,300
There is not everybody right now

961
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
go into your mind Inception style.

962
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,220
Get rid of the fear of being turned down

963
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,020
because you know what?

964
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,300
That can't hurt you.

965
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,420
Nobody ever died from it.

966
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,860
You get tougher and cooler.

967
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm still afraid of it,

968
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,820
but that's only because I'm batting a thousand.

969
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,500
I'm pitching a perfect game.

970
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,100
You've never been rejected so.

971
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,740
I've stolen every base I've tried to steal.

972
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,380
I've baseball metaphored every baseball metaphor.

973
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,900
And I'm afraid that one errant pitch,

974
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,780
one errant baseball

975
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,620
will fuck up my whole streak.

976
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,660
Yeah, I understand that completely.

977
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,540
I get it.

978
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,060
And also I'm just like a really polite,

979
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,500
like nice guy.

980
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm not saying that to my own horn

981
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,980
is just the real talk.

982
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,060
And I don't want to put a lady in a position

983
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,180
where she has to come up with an excuse

984
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,540
not to give me her number.

985
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,660
That's fucked up.

986
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,460
When I say it out loud,

987
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,540
it sounded more fucked up than it was in my head.

988
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,420
Well, then I don't want to be like,

989
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,100
I'm just so busy with work right now

990
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,460
that I can't give you my phone number.

991
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,820
I think we should all just enter into

992
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,180
a social contract with each other

993
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,020
that it's okay for a guy to say,

994
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,220
hey, can I get your number?

995
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,980
And it's okay for the girl to say no.

996
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,460
Yeah, see if the girl said no,

997
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,580
if the girl said no,

998
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,140
then I would be like happier than she was like,

999
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,700
well, I don't know,

1000
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,020
because my aunt bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop,

1001
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,940
like lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.

1002
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,940
If you lie to me, I just feel bad

1003
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,900
because I made you lie.

1004
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,540
I made you say it,

1005
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,500
and now you have to go to hell.

1006
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,980
Peace out.

1007
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,620
Waiting by the phone,

1008
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
I think you should also probably get a little bit better

1009
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,900
at figuring out people are in,

1010
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,820
if people are into it,

1011
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,180
if people are feeling your flavor,

1012
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,660
because I'm not sure you are super great at that yet.

1013
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,180
You'll get there.

1014
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,900
You'll get there.

1015
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,500
Also, girls don't call guys.

1016
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,900
Sorry, that's society.

1017
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,100
You got to get on the hunt,

1018
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
get on the hunt, pursue,

1019
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
pursue a figure and passion,

1020
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,940
and don't wait for her to finish her conversation

1021
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,500
with her friends.

1022
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,980
Also, asking someone if they want to grab lunch

1023
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,660
is a passive thing that friends do.

1024
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,540
Ask her to dinner,

1025
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,420
ask her to a movie,

1026
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,540
ask her on a real date.

1027
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,020
Ask her to hold lunch.

1028
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,660
Hold, ask her to have sex with you today.

1029
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,700
Hey, I've got a Yahoo answer.

1030
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,180
Do you want to hear it?

1031
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,300
Sure.

1032
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,260
Yeah, of course.

1033
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,980
It was sent in.

1034
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,780
This is incredible.

1035
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,180
It was this exact question was sent in

1036
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,220
by both Mike Bachman and Jacob Locker.

1037
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,620
You two get married.

1038
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,460
Two heavy ass hitters

1039
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
in the Yahoo answer submission game

1040
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,260
that we all met.

1041
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,660
We met both of them at Praxis this past weekend.

1042
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,500
And I suspect they love juicing.

1043
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,780
They're probably juicing.

1044
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,700
They're probably on a little bit of some

1045
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,660
anabolic steroids just to get their humor muscles toned up.

1046
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,020
They are as handsome as their submissions.

1047
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,820
I will say that.

1048
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,660
This question,

1049
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,700
it was, it's written by Panda Coley who asks,

1050
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,100
is this weird for brothers?

1051
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,620
It's right in our wheelhouse, right?

1052
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,580
No, sure, I guess.

1053
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,540
I'm going to say that now.

1054
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,260
My twin brother and I take baths together

1055
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,100
because my mom wants to save money.

1056
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,900
Smart, right?

1057
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,100
We are 17 and it seems a little weird now

1058
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,220
compared to when we were young.

1059
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,500
Do you think this is weird or not?

1060
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,460
What are those ages again?

1061
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,220
They're twins.

1062
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,180
So we're assuming that they're the same age.

1063
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,100
Although it would be even weirder if they weren't.

1064
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,780
Like I'm 20 and he's eight.

1065
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,380
They're 17.

1066
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,900
Why is it taking you this long to wonder if that's weird?

1067
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,460
Hey, mommy.

1068
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,060
Hey, mommy.

1069
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,980
We both can't fit in the bathtub anymore

1070
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,940
because we have grown human adult bodies, mommy.

1071
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,220
Hey, mommy, we're full grown humans.

1072
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,900
There's no way that you can stack us in here

1073
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,540
like Tetris blocks that we're not going to touch.

1074
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,100
Your, our parts will touch.

1075
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,860
There's no bathtub big enough to have a naked shower

1076
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,140
with your 17 year old brother.

1077
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,020
That's fat.

1078
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,900
That's a fat.

1079
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,860
It's not a shower.

1080
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,580
It's a bath.

1081
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,340
When you, when you take a bath,

1082
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,980
you're making soup out of your, out of your grossness.

1083
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,660
You're making soup out of your-

1084
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,180
If I ever open like a, like a bathroom fixture store

1085
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,820
and I sell like-

1086
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,940
Or a soup store.

1087
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,820
Or a soup store.

1088
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,820
I'm going to advertise my large tub

1089
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,100
as big enough for two full grown 17 year old males.

1090
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,180
The problem is when you're in a, when you're in a bath,

1091
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,380
which is already pretty gross,

1092
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,660
you're just making broth.

1093
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,500
You're making Todd broth or Zach broth.

1094
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm making-

1095
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,500
You're making your own gravy.

1096
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,980
When you get, when you get Tony up in there,

1097
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,060
that's officially a stew and that's unacceptable.

1098
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,260
Okay, wait, wait.

1099
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,460
I have this all figured out.

1100
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,700
The mother is not a weirdo.

1101
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,900
The mother started selling Todd and Tony stew.

1102
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,620
Yeah.

1103
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,460
Like when they were little kids

1104
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,860
and now she doesn't know how to cut off that revenue stream.

1105
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,580
This is oaky.

1106
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,180
Somebody's been playing soccer.

1107
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,780
This is getting better with age.

1108
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,900
I love this stew.

1109
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,180
You have to give me your secret recipe, Tammy.

1110
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,900
I can't.

1111
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,780
It's a dash of Todd, dash of Zach,

1112
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,780
and just like a whole bunch of weirdness

1113
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,700
that they are never going to recover from.

1114
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,940
Just can't recover from this.

1115
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,900
You can, you can really taste the scarring.

1116
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,380
The two things that aren't going to recover from the stew

1117
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,460
are your hunger and Todd and Tony.

1118
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,260
Those are the two parts that will,

1119
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,780
that will never make a comeback.

1120
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,580
What's the age?

1121
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,220
What's the cutoff?

1122
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,340
Can we come up with this right now

1123
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,620
and then we can send it to Panda Coley

1124
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,340
and just be like,

1125
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,660
you need to turn your mom into the fucking police.

1126
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:08,980
Five.

1127
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah, five.

1128
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,220
You think once you come off the T,

1129
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,180
like once you come off,

1130
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,780
I would say once you're off the T,

1131
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,100
not that I was on the T at five, come on.

1132
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,620
I'm saying like off the T,

1133
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,980
off the brothers lap in the bathtub,

1134
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,020
you fucking weirdo.

1135
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,260
Get off of there.

1136
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
I would say that as soon as you're old enough

1137
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,420
to no longer need a spotter,

1138
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,660
like if you're afraid of like drowning in the bathtub,

1139
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,020
make sure there's someone else in there.

1140
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,020
Okay, but wait a minute.

1141
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,060
Wait just a second because that life is like a recursive.

1142
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,340
It's like a snail shell.

1143
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,780
And once you get to be like 80,

1144
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,820
you need a spotter again.

1145
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
Can we start throwing 80 year olds in the same bath?

1146
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,380
Yeah.

1147
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,300
Yeah, and they shrink too.

1148
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,660
Like they get better.

1149
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,220
They do.

1150
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Old people are basically Shrinky Dinks

1151
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,220
that you put in the bathtub

1152
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,100
and then you got a full-

1153
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,460
And you look at their Shrinky Dinks.

1154
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,300
I can debate the number as far as age a little bit.

1155
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,100
I can give you some wiggle room, no pun intended.

1156
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,700
But if, I have to put a firm wall on pubes.

1157
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,300
In fact, the T-shirt says,

1158
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,780
if you see a hair, you can't be there.

1159
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,180
That's the rule for me on bathtubs.

1160
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,940
Like you can't, at that point, no dice.

1161
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,820
What about, can we put an old dude

1162
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,500
and like a baby in the same bathtub?

1163
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,100
Like an 85 year old.

1164
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,580
Well, but then I feel like that's unfair to the baby

1165
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,020
because if the old man goes down,

1166
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,540
what's the baby supposed to do?

1167
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,900
Baby can't save that old man.

1168
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,220
He doesn't have the lung strength.

1169
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,460
What if we get a baby, an old man,

1170
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,260
and a 17 year old all up in the same bath?

1171
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,980
And then you gotta get them all across the river

1172
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,500
from one bath to the next.

1173
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,300
The baby, the old man will eat the baby.

1174
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,900
Yeah, no question about that.

1175
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,780
He's confused.

1176
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
The 17 year old will eat the grain.

1177
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,620
You have two rafts, go.

1178
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,980
Go, solve it.

1179
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,380
Hey, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

1180
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
But first I wanna say thank you

1181
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,460
to everybody we met at PAX East this weekend.

1182
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,300
You were total sweethearts.

1183
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,620
We saw so many My Brother, My Brother, Me shirts.

1184
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,100
We saw our friend Brentalfloss was there.

1185
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,180
He put on a great show.

1186
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,780
And you guys were all so nice and genuine.

1187
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,460
It made me really look forward to April 17th.

1188
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,180
What up?

1189
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,540
Because it's my birthday.

1190
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,700
We'll be in Chicago and we'll be doing

1191
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,460
My Brother, My Brother, Me live

1192
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,300
opening up for Jordan and Jesse Go.

1193
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,340
What's up?

1194
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,900
Are you there?

1195
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,860
Yeah, I should say so.

1196
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,260
Tickets are gonna be way affordable.

1197
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,580
They're gonna go on sale soon, I would imagine.

1198
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,700
We'll let you know.

1199
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,420
We'll let you know.

1200
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,820
Follow us on Twitter and keep checking Maximum Fun.

1201
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,940
That really is my birthday, by the way.

1202
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,100
And we are gonna go out afterwards and get silly.

1203
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,380
We're gonna get slizzard.

1204
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,340
We are gonna get our wastey faces on.

1205
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,580
We're gonna get our dicks wet.

1206
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,540
I don't know, because we're on a water slide.

1207
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,300
We're gonna make it so wet.

1208
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,260
We're gonna go to the old town ale house

1209
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,860
and we're gonna go on a water slide

1210
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,700
because those are all over the place here in Chicago.

1211
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,020
Yeah, just streets are littered with them.

1212
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,900
I rode a water slide all the way from O'Hare to my apartment.

1213
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,500
Keep it, keep it.

1214
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,060
Keep your focus on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1215
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,220
nbnbam.com, nbn, at nbnbam on Twitter

and we will let you know about tickets and everything

1217
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,260
but it's gonna be off the chain, off the hook, off the chuck.

1218
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,760
So right.

1219
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,900
If you wanna get in touch with us,

1220
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,780

1221
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,540
You'll see our email address.

1222
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,300
We have a voicemail that you can call.

1223
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,020
What's that number, Griff?

1224
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,900
It's 203-nbnbam1.

1225
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,400
Yep.

1226
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,180
And you can call us for questions and stuff.

1227
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,820
Again, we can't thank you guys enough

1228
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,140
for your support with Maximum Fun Drive.

1229
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,260
Holy shit.

1230
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,820
We had a couple of people who, you know,

1231
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,780
groused a little bit.

1232
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,820
Most of you were just so generous

1233
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,420
and gracious about the whole thing.

1234
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,260
Seriously, it's the best.

1235
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,340
If you donated and you haven't listened

1236
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,700
to all the other shows,

1237
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,980
now is the best time to do so

1238
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,340
because you're supporting them.

1239
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,380
They're your shows.

1240
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,060
They're your shows.

1241
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,700
Go listen to them.

1242
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,660
Go give them a listen.

1243
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,860
Subscribe and shit.

1244
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,980
I don't know how podcasts work.

1245
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,740
I just make them.

1246
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,020
That's all there is to it.

1247
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,300
Hey, Griffin.

1248
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:27,800
Hey.

1249
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,140
I'm ready.

1250
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,300
Oh, one more time just to remind you.

1251
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,980
Go check out kingdomofliving.com

1252
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,020
if you haven't.

1253
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,140
Go do it right now.

1254
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,020
It's free.

1255
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,780
It's free as fuck.

1256
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,980
So fucking free.

1257
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,360
Do it.

1258
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,040
Oh, man.

1259
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,940
How about this?

1260
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,380
So this one's sent in by Jackie or Jaqui Ronan.

1261
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,020
There's a Q and a U in there.

1262
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,380
I'm just spitballing.

1263
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Zoraz.

1264
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,220
Who says Quidditch for dogs?

1265
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,180
Is this true?

1266
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,500
This is Justin McElroy.

1267
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,100
This is Travis McElroy.

1268
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,780
This is Griffin McElroy.

1269
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,020
This is my brother, my brother and me.

1270
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,540
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1271
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,140
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1272
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,100
Keep your heart.

1273
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,260
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

1274
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,300
Keep your heart.

1275
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

1276
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,980
These girls are smart.

1277
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:58,740
Play your card.
