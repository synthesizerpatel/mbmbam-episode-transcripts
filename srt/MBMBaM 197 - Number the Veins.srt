1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and me, an advice show from the modern era.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
I don't know why I decided to scat the title.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm your baby-est baby brother, Griffin.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,440
You know that he's actually saying words in rusted rude Simmi on my way.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,400
He's saying words.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,440
I know the words, I know the words.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,400
It's not, I think, scat on purpose.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,840
I used to think, is nobody safe, nobody on? It's not that.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,040
That is 100% it.

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
Guys, I guess I'm less of the baby now, aren't I?

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,360
Less of the baby.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,400
You're finally a man.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,840
Finally a man.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
It took me a few extra years on top of that.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
The McElroy tradition is at 27, 27.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Griffin, how does 27 feel to you? How does it feel?

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
I mean, here's the thing.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Rachel got me a box of Tiff's Treats for my birthday, a local warm cookie delivery company,

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,480
and I ate like three quarters of the box just like as soon as I received it.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,080
So I don't know that necessarily I'm more of an adult.

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
Just that doesn't, it's not an adult way to consume cookies.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
My age is actually defined by the fact that if I did that, I would die.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,480
Yeah.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,800
How did your rum-tum tummy feel afterwards?

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
Rum-tum shitty.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Did not enjoy it.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah, I'm, I-

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Did not enjoy, would not recommend.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
No.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Savor that right now, though, because it didn't kill you.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
No, I know, it sounds like I got it in under the fucking wire.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Because I guess in like, what, six years, then like one of my feet will fall off if I try that.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Best time.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
It's such a big day.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
Griffin had his birthday on the 17th.

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
By the way, P.O. Box 54, 120-

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
If you want to send Justin presents for my birthday that I will never receive.

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll make sure he gets them.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
That's no problem.

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
It's Griffin's 27th birthday.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,280
It's 420.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,000
It's Easter.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
He is risen.

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
And there's going to be a new episode of Game of Thrones.

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
That's what I'm most excited about.

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,600
Travis was keen to point that out.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm finally caught up after, I think the show's been on for eight years, and I finally, like,

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
watched it.

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
This shit's really good, you guys.

56
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
I don't know if you know this.

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah, thanks, Travis.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
It's like an underground success.

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
I can't wait to read the novelization of the show.

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
It's really bad.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,720
Yeah?

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
It's boring and everybody has- here's something that surprised me if you read the books.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
All the people in the show have names.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
I thought three of them did, but no, they've all got names and none of them are like Dylan

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
or like Ralphie.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
What's great, now that I'm caught up, it's having conversations with people about the

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
show and this is, no joke, the conversation I had with my friend Charlie.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
Yeah, that one guy, Jory.

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
No, the other one.

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Jorah?

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,080
No, the other one.

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,720
George.

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,680
Marma.

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
The onion guy?

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
No, the other one.

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Stannis.

77
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,200
No, I know Stannis.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
This is not Stannis.

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't know who you're talking about.

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,880
I still- I've watched every episode of the show and I read the first two books and still

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,120
there are times when I think that one of the guys is another guy.

82
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
The guy who- I tell you the problem with this show is the guy who is down with the lady

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
who wears red all the time, he is the most generic dude in the world.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
He could be popping up like every few scenes in like the background and I would not notice

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,760
that.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
They could swap that actor out daily.

87
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
Wait, do you mean Stannis?

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,160
His name is basically Stan is also not helping.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,600
He looks like a fucking superintendent.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
But it's Stan's buddy, it's Stan's buddy gray beard dude, the onion, who I simply cannot

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
remember his name except that he's the onion knight.

92
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Dr. Onion.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Boy, the silly knight.

94
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
Silly knight, onion boy.

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,800
Like, there's not really anything funny about Game of Thrones so let's talk about our listeners

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
and their problems and try to help them because that's what we do.

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,840
Why?

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
Yeah, let's just not talk about Jesus.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,640
I thought we were gonna skew into Jesus jokes for a while there and I thought we really

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,200
pulled it out.

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Good job, guys.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, I saved my one good he is risen joke for-

103
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
He is blazin' 420.

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
There's only one day worth coming back from the dead four.

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
All you care about is babes and grindeds, Justin.

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm sick of it.

107
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
And wheezing the juice.

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,480
And wheezing and grinded.

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,320
I've recently gotten back into the dating scene while in universe.

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,240
Listen, this is an American show and if you're gonna write into it, it's college, which makes

111
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
money for dates hard to come by.

112
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,680
Is it in bad taste to use gift cards and coupons while on a date?

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,280
Regards.

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't want to miss this chance in Canada.

115
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Oh, man.

116
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,120
Oh, man.

117
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
It's in bad taste if you're using Applebee's gift cards on that date.

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
Because oopsies-

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,400
Especially if you're not at Applebee's.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Oopsie went to Applebee's.

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Do you accept Applebee's gift cards?

122
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,600
So this is a red robin.

123
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Do they have-

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm aware.

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Do they have the bees in Canada?

126
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
It's just called Le Applebee's.

127
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
Oh, great.

128
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
Yeah, no, why wouldn't it be called that for sure?

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
But they have to have both on the side.

130
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
So every Applebee's is huge.

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,520
Because they have that- I thought every restaurant in Canada needed to be named after

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
like a very manly sounding man.

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
This is Paul Thwackam.

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm not joking.

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,760
I thought every restaurant had to fall into like even top of the line,

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
like a Vancouver bistro had to be called like-

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
Are you basing this off of anything other than Tim Hortons?

138
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
And Stan Makita's Donuts notwithstanding.

139
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,480
Because I was living in Illinois and in Wayne's World.

140
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
But close enough.

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,040
I consider Illinois basically Canada's Alaska.

142
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,200
Illinois is non-contiguous Canada.

143
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,960
Isn't it odd how the very behaviors that might make someone a desirable life partner-

144
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Right, like frugality.

145
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:10,000
Are antithetical to the actual wooing of said person.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,320
I don't know.

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,120
I would be pretty goddamn wooed if somebody was like,

148
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
oh, by the way, don't even worry about it.

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Groupon, he slammed down Groupon.

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,120
I'd be all about that.

151
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
Here's what you gotta do.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I think Groupon has more- Okay, so let me- Okay, Groupon I think is trendier.

153
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
I think Groupon has an air of hipness to it.

154
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
If you pull out, like if you're at Captain D's and you pull out a coupon-

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
You already fucked up.

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,960
That's what I'm saying.

157
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, hold on Justin.

158
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm gonna stop you there.

159
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't think the coupon's gonna have any impact on this.

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,440
If you're at the D's or the B's, you've done fucked up before you even started.

161
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,640
What if you say, listen, fella, I'm taking you to Applebee's and I'm gonna use a gift card.

162
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:59,120
But I'm gonna use the differential on another date activity post dinner.

163
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,760
So I have a $25 Applebee's gift card.

164
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,640
You and me, we're gonna go to Applebee's and save some dope.

165
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,400
But then I'm gonna take that $25 and then I'm gonna take you to Cold Stone

166
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
for a little post Applebee's roundup and get you the German chocolate cake

167
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,080
or maybe some of those ice cream cupcakes they got there that you like so much.

168
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,040
And we'll just, I'll pass, basically what I'm saying is I'll pass the savings on to you.

169
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,680
Can you just go right back through those revolving doors,

170
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
right back into Applebee's for a second dip?

171
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,400
You save, you drop the card, you pay for the entire first Applebee's dip,

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
your first B's and you pay for all that.

173
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,760
Like I got this.

174
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,960
And then you bounce out, step outside, maybe have a smoke,

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,560
post B's smoke in the Applebee's smoking plaza.

176
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,120
And then you turn right back around and you go in

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
and maybe you try a different one of their delicious $9 entrees.

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,320
I have been to Applebee's, because of my geographical location,

179
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
I've been to Applebee's more times than I care to admit.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
And of the many thoughts that have crossed my mind after an Applebee's meal,

181
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
most of them regretful in nature, I've never thought to myself,

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,480
the one I thought I've never had is, man, I just want to be here another hour.

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
I just want to soak this in.

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,040
I didn't see that picture of that lacrosse team nearly long enough.

185
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
Those Jason Sudeikis commercials that he voices over

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
at the end of Beach One is see you tomorrow.

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,120
And that could be seen as sort of a veiled threat after you just finished.

188
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,960
If you left to the Applebee's and you go home and you do have diarrhea

189
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
and then you turn on one of those commercials and Sudeikis is like,

190
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
hey, you are coming back here every day until you die.

191
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,440
I don't know.

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
Have you guys ever gotten carry out from an Applebee's?

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,600
Yes.

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
The method, I don't know if this is universal,

195
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,240
but the method by which one gets carry out from Applebee's is the sketchiest,

196
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,560
like most tacit admission that their whole atmosphere is the wackest.

197
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,480
You have to, you tell them what car you're driving

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,840
and you pull up to like a secret side door.

199
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,200
You flash your blinkers twice.

200
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
You flash your blinkers twice.

201
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,800
You don't have to flash your blinkers,

202
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,280
but it does help if you have your headlights on and they say,

203
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
oh, there he is.

204
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
He's in the Kia.

205
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
Go take this out to him.

206
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,320
And you exchange the money for services right in your car.

207
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
It's the dirtiest.

208
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
I'm always tempted when they bring the food out to say like,

209
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,200
quick, quick, get in.

210
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Get in the passenger seat.

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
I want to be able to see you.

212
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Let's do this in the car.

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,960
People are watching.

214
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Yeah.

215
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,800
You got the stuff.

216
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,880
You got, hey, hey, what's in the bag?

217
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
You got them onion dippers.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,760
You got onion blasters, straw slippers, slippers.

219
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
I'll be back here tomorrow.

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
I'll be here tomorrow because Jason Sudeikis told me to on TV.

221
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
How about a real quick hand job?

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,000
You accept, you give cards.

223
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
My date's in the back seat.

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey, what's up?

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm the date.

226
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
Hey, give him a hand job.

227
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
You didn't forget the onion sloss, did you?

228
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
That's a hybrid slaw and sauce for onions.

229
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Onion sloss.

230
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
Dip it in and suck it down.

231
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,440
Okay.

232
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,160
How about a Yahoo?

233
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,840
We have not helped this person at all.

234
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
So in closing, you're welcome.

235
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600
I find frugality incredibly erotically fascinating.

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
You're 27.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah.

238
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,760
If I went on a date with someone and I pulled out, well, first of all, my wife would be very upset.

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,840
But if I pulled out a gift card and they judge me harshly for that, I'd be like, okay, this is done.

240
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,320
That's how you're judging my quality as a person is whether I use a gift card or not.

241
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
I actually think if I went on a date with somebody who was disciplined enough to have a gift card,

242
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
remember they had the gift card, go to the place to use the gift card,

243
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,840
and then actually present the gift card, I would think, oh, thank God it's an adult.

244
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
Thank God I have an adult to take care of me.

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
Because the other side of that coin is basically if they judge you for it,

246
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,960
what they're saying is like, oh, you couldn't just pay real money for that?

247
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Like, what?

248
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,480
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

249
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
It's as good as money.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
It's just you turn it into onion sloss.

251
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,940
Right?

252
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,920
Same as money.

253
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,720
I would be kind of bummed out because then I would know that that person has a grandpa that's

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,560
maybe not so keen on getting to know what that person's it.

255
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Oh, like, oh, you have a pretty strained and distant relationship with your grandpa.

256
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,960
That's too bad.

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,920
Like, we probably would have waited until date four or five to bring that up.

258
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,800
But that telltale bee's gift card has outed the secret, I guess.

259
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,600
Yahoo me Griffin.

260
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
I'll give you a tight Yahoo.

261
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
This one's sent in by Cruz Flores.

262
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,920
Thank you, Cruz.

263
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Death Star, who asks,

264
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,080
I want my cat to develop abs like Ninja Turtles.

265
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,580
Mm-hmm.

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,960
How can I do it?

267
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,880
So he wants a warrior cat, basically.

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,240
I don't think the warrior cats have sweet, sexy, rippling abs.

269
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
Ah, they probably do somewhere.

270
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,200
This person clearly seems unaware that the Ninja Turtles also do not have abs.

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
I guess it was their shell.

272
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
That's their shell, dumbass.

273
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,680
Well, maybe-

274
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
Jeez, read a book.

275
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,040
Maybe they watched the trailer for the, what's that fucking, what's that dude's name?

276
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,080
The one who makes all the movies?

277
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
Michael Cheddar Bay.

278
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,960
Steven Spielberg.

279
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Michael Bay.

280
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,520
And he made that trailer, and you can tell, like, they look pretty busted, right?

281
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,480
They look like they might-

282
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,280
They don't look good.

283
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,080
They look pretty, they look all ripped up.

284
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:00,160
And I think you can just sort of intuit that they have, they're fucking blasting some green

285
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,280
ass shippable shit in there.

286
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I thought that those Ninja Turtles, they look like a six-year-old's drawing of Ninja Turtles

287
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,440
from, like, having watched, like, one episode.

288
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
That is what the ones in the Michael Bay-

289
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,640
But, like, creepily, like, all ripped and busted.

290
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,040
Like, they look like Ninja Turtles that have been, like, smoking two packs a day since they

291
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,540
were born.

292
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,040
They look a little bit torn up.

293
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,600
Like, since their heyday, they've just been sort of-

294
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,440
It looks like underground.

295
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,040
You'd think they would have lived since 1988.

296
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah, kind of.

297
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Here's the other thing about us.

298
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,520
You don't know, we're immortal, and we can never die, and we have to live in shells in

299
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,080
the sewer.

300
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,160
But we do clearly age.

301
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,080
Yeah, the Ninja Turtles-

302
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,560
They're beginning to look a lot more like Ninja Tortoises.

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,040
Ninja Turtles came, and they saved me from Shredder, and it was awesome, and they smelled

304
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,480
like a million grandmas.

305
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,440
They stink like shit.

306
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,960
They gave me some chocolates out of their purse, and it tasted like Virginia Slims.

307
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Did it- I mean, did they smell bad because they live in a sewer?

308
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,160
No, they smelled like an old, old man that was, like, real ripped up and torn up, and

309
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,360
just, like, real Haggard.

310
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
They gave me an Applebee's gift card.

311
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,240
They gave me an Applebee's gift card because they just couldn't be fucking bothered to

312
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,880
get to know me.

313
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,880
What does go through your head when you're like, you know what, I bet he would like

314
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,960
Applebee's, but I don't know what he likes there.

315
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,600
I can't just go get him the thing he wants if he doesn't want it right now.

316
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,400
Don't you remember that one time when Billy told me all he wanted for Christmas was a

317
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,680
couple of Brutuses?

318
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,720
You remember.

319
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,280
A couple shot glasses full of sugary goo.

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,560
Okay.

321
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,600
Canyon sloths.

322
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
Okay, so listen.

323
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,560
I want my cat to develop how he's like Ninja Turtles.

324
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,080
I don't think it's outside the realm of possibilities because cats got tummies, and you can probably

325
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,440
tighten that shit up.

326
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,320
You could probably get that tummy a little bit tighter, kitty kitty.

327
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,640
Cat crunches.

328
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,640
What if you pick him up underneath their front legs, and then, because, like, as they're

329
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,560
trying to get away, that seems like that would be good for the core, doesn't it?

330
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
Like, you pick them up by their front.

331
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,600
You pick them up, like, underneath their armpits, basically, and you hold them aloft, like, sort

332
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,840
of like, uh, teach them to walk in the Lion King pose, right?

333
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,320
And then they're flailing to try to get away from your grip, and while they're doing it,

334
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,520
they're blasting their core.

335
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
They're just getting super, super ripped.

336
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,280
If I, if I kiss my kitty's tummy over and over again, just tickle and tickle my nose

337
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,920
with soft, tummy hairs, is that going to give them a stronger core?

338
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,560
It might, because they would get the giggles.

339
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,920
And if you're giggling, laughter is the best medicine, or ab workout.

340
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,440
Laughter is the best ab workout.

341
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,160
I'll tickle this.

342
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,440
You could also put that thing on their tummy that electroshocks it.

343
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh, tight, yeah.

344
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,360
No, that would be good.

345
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,880
And one of those, like, you could put them in one of those jiggly belts that you see in,

346
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,960
like, 50s fitness things.

347
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Can I tell you how awesome it would be to walk into a room and see a cat just standing

348
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,400
up in one of those things, like, drinking a Bloody Mary and smoking a cigarette and,

349
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
like, getting fit.

350
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,960
Cooking an, like, old-time microwave meal that, like, has, like, the foil and shit on it.

351
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't think, I don't think, I don't think there were microwave meals with foil on them

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,520
at any point in recorded history.

353
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,880
That seems like-

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
No, I mean, it took them a while to, it took them a while to figure that shit out.

355
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
This food has eyeballs on it.

356
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
What are we doing wrong?

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,720
We fucked up.

358
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,280
We don't understand microwaves.

359
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,640
You know that we couldn't use microwaves for the first 30 years after they were invented

360
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,800
because we kept trying to put foil in there?

361
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,800
Justin, I don't think I can go on the rest of the show just because I, since this idea

362
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,640
was first proposed, all I can think about is your chunky dumpster of a cat with one

363
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,040
of those shake, with one of those shake belts on it.

364
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,160
And just, like, imagining how that would, how that would go.

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,600
First off, Claudia Jean is slimming down.

366
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,400
How much?

367
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,120
What's she down to?

368
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
She's down to 18 pounds.

369
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,640
That's from 20.

370
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,280
So she's, like, on the road to recovery.

371
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,240
She's trying to get fit.

372
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,800
She hates every second of it, and she still won't exercise even though I asked her to.

373
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,360
And I got her that Billy Blanks tape she asked for, and she doesn't ever put it in.

374
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,840
Ever.

375
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,960
The closet is just full of different articles, those stretchy, like, ropes and, like, the

376
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,920
perfect push-up.

377
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,120
All of it.

378
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,480
The ab roller, none of it.

379
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
She won't touch it.

380
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,280
She asked for them, and then once they show up, like, oh, I don't remember.

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,400
I don't know.

382
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Maybe I'll definitely, definitely try that.

383
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Oh, yeah.

384
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,160
She won't.

385
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,320
Good suggestione.

386
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,200
Let me see that.

387
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah, I'll read this during lunch.

388
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,440
Did you just want me to pee on this?

389
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,680
Or, no, I would like you to use it and blast your core.

390
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,080
Please.

391
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,120
If your cat was on The Biggest Loser, which, which trainer do you think she'd want to be

392
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,680
teamed up with?

393
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,240
Jarlington?

394
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,200
Jarlington.

395
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,440
Yeah.

396
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Claude Jarlington?

397
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,200
Claude Jarlington.

398
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,040
He is, he is two of them.

399
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah, he exercised so hard that he divided via mitosis.

400
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,400
And if you hurt one, the other feels its pain like those brothers from the GI Joe.

401
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,120
Exactly that.

402
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,440
100%.

403
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,520
You got it 100% right.

404
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,840
Thanks.

405
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,320
I mean, like, yes, my cat's overweight.

406
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,680
Like, I didn't know what I was.

407
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,200
I don't know how it happened.

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,440
You feed her turkey out of the fridge.

409
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,320
Not anymore.

410
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,520
And also, she loves it.

411
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,680
One of my hobbies is traditional archery.

412
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,480
I enjoy archery because it's a calm, methodical, physical skill that gets me outside.

413
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,840
However, I also have a geeky interest in history and fantasy.

414
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,880
For a long time, I've been looking at clothes that would pass for a peasant longbow man.

415
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Uh, but I think I can get an ensemble that I will enjoy for around $80.

416
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
But the thought of spending this much pains me.

417
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,280
We have a medieval outfit.

418
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,120
While having a medieval outfit would be cool.

419
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,280
I do not think I would be brave enough to wear it in public.

420
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,200
Not public in general, but well, no fairs or Halloween parties, sans deadly weapon.

421
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,360
Uh, even if I could work up the courage to dress up outside the house,

422
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,440
it bothers me that I would spend money on something I would only wear a few times a year.

423
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,840
Brothers, should I indulge in my geek side or just, uh, let a fun dream be a fun dream?

424
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,960
That's from Maryman in Minnesota.

425
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,760
Holy shit.

426
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
This is the best question.

427
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,240
It's really good because we've all struggled with this at some point.

428
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,720
We've all been here in some variation.

429
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Uh, I have a few questions.

430
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,840
First off, you've said you'd only wear it to places like rent fairs or Halloween parties,

431
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,440
but you'd wear it without the deadly weapon.

432
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:12,360
So from what I can tell, there is no context in which the bow and the garb,

433
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,280
the tunic would be worn simultaneously.

434
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay.

435
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,040
So I don't see the connection to your archery, right?

436
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,920
First off.

437
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,280
Have you guys ever seen Arrow?

438
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,360
Hell yes.

439
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Please, can we not talk about Arrow?

440
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,480
It's just once you get Justin fucking going on Arrow, good luck.

441
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,520
You guys want to talk about Arrow?

442
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not again.

443
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,720
I can't fall into this.

444
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,960
Can this guy get a Kickstarter going?

445
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,840
I would kickstart your tunic.

446
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,600
I would kickstart all $80 of it.

447
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,200
Absolutely.

448
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
America's Next Top Arrowman.

449
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,120
Let me say this, Merry Man.

450
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,080
You better have some compelling reward tiers because I think you are going to be passing

451
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,000
the early boundaries.

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,760
One, I assume $80 to buy the tunic, $10,000 for your medical bills after somebody beats your ass.

453
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:17,240
And then once you get past $10,080, I want to know what else you've got cooking up.

454
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,400
I don't think in any of these situations that this person is talking about, wearing

455
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,200
this peasant longbowman garb is one that is going to get their ass beat.

456
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
Here is my thing.

457
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,360
I've been thinking about this probably a lot more than is natural or healthy, but do you

458
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,400
think that when you roll out to a run for it, there's got to be a hierarchy of the dudes who

459
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:47,240
have spent $8,000, $10,000 on their full suits of armor, and then they see somebody roll up in just

460
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,200
a puffy shirt and leather pants, and they're like, check out this bugger.

461
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,840
Fuck spending $8,000, $10,000 on a full suit of armor.

462
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,520
How about the people who have spent 30 or 40 years becoming a goddamn blacksmithing

463
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:07,640
artisan, like going out and, you know, farming tin ore in the Hillsbrad foothills and then

464
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,760
coming home to smelt that shit and then making armor for themselves specifically that they can

465
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,360
only wear in this one fucking scenario.

466
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,120
I think that they are probably at the top of the caste system.

467
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,120
So you have to imagine that, like, there is the possibility you would roll up to the

468
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,920
bin fair and suddenly a swarm of ne'er-do elves would descend upon you and beat your ass.

469
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,200
I think that's possible.

470
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,040
That's why you gotta have that bow.

471
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,960
You gotta be armed.

472
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
Yeah, definitely.

473
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,400
I don't think you can wear a tunic without the bow to back it up, I guess is what I'm

474
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,360
saying to you.

475
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,640
That's beautiful.

476
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,320
I also don't understand the compulsion to dress like a peasant longbowman.

477
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
We're all play and pretend.

478
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,360
Listen, most days I wear cargo shorts and a t-shirt.

479
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,640
And if that's not modern day peasant garb, I don't know what is.

480
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,600
So I don't know why at a rim fair I wouldn't want to dress up like a fancy jimmy.

481
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,440
It's like going to San Diego Comic Con and cosplaying as Jimmy Olsen.

482
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,360
Like, get fucked together.

483
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm Fitzpatrick Fitzwallis, the guy Superman rescues.

484
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,240
Yeah, I'm Spider-Man's landlord.

485
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,880
My name's Hank.

486
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,380
Hank.

487
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
Hank Landlordman.

488
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,640
I got the powers of I fix that faucet for you.

489
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,360
No problem.

490
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Let me know if you got any other questions.

491
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,480
And I don't ask any questions.

492
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm real dumb.

493
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,920
I do know his dark secret, though.

494
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,000
He takes really bad shits.

495
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,040
Clogs that mother crapper up.

496
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,600
Spent a lot of time on Spidey's clogs.

497
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
Here's the one thing about me.

498
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm really good at getting blood out of stuff.

499
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,000
He bleeds all over everything, that kid.

500
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,880
No problem.

501
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,720
No big deal.

502
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
I fix that squeaky window too, Pete.

503
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,760
The one you used to get in and out of your apartment.

504
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
Can I make a suggestion?

505
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,240
If you want a garb to go along with your archery,

506
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,080
can I suggest instead of a peasant longbow garb,

507
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,960
you instead cosplay as Geena Davis?

508
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,680
I love this.

509
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,200
Just like real life Geena Davis?

510
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
Not like character Geena Davis.

511
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,600
Real life Geena Davis.

512
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,040
Real life Geena Davis who's a master archer.

513
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
Who's a goddamn incredible archer.

514
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,880
Incredible badass.

515
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,520
Can I get a fat head for my baby daughter's wall

516
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,800
of Geena Davis, like mid archery?

517
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,920
That would be amazing.

518
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,600
This is who I want you to aspire to.

519
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,440
The star of Cutthroat Island and master archer Geena Davis.

520
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Also check out Speechless.

521
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,480
Not bad.

522
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,600
Pretty okay.

523
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,120
Let me check the warehouse.

524
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,960
Let me check in the back in the stock room.

525
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,960
We only have a fat head of Geena Davis from Earth Girls Are Easy.

526
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,240
I knew it.

527
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
It's always that.

528
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,040
Listen, after that movie came out, well before it came out,

529
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,160
they produced, I don't want to give away their trade secrets,

530
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,960
but four and a half million fat heads of Geena Davis

531
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
from Earth Girls Are Easy.

532
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,880
Because they thought that that was going to take the world

533
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,480
by storm, that those classic characters as portrayed

534
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,200
by Jim Carrey, oh, I can do this.

535
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,680
Come on.

536
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
Jeff Daniels.

537
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,240
Incorrect.

538
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,520
No, you messed it.

539
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
You switched your Jeffs.

540
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Jeff Goldblum.

541
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,840
Correct.

542
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,680
And Ah Wayans.

543
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Ah, but which Wayans, sir?

544
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,640
Ah, the oldest question.

545
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,320
Damon Wayans, senior.

546
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,520
Damn it's who you're looking for.

547
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,520
So we're all agreed that you need to buy yourself an outfit, right?

548
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah, buy it.

549
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,480
For $80, wear it where you feel comfortable.

550
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
It'll feel tight to have it, I bet.

551
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,720
If you want it, here's my thing.

552
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,400
If you want it, fucking buy it.

553
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,680
It's not going to, if it's not going to hurt you,

554
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,400
fucking buy the thing that's going to make you happy.

555
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,000
We need to rebuild this economy.

556
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,880
Too sweet.

557
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,360
Right.

558
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes.

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,240
There are leather workers that are desperate for a client

560
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,880
and you can provide them an admittedly apparently meager amount of work.

561
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,040
I'm saying $80 is, that's nothing.

562
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,640
Ooh, ooh, what about this?

563
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,320
Teach yourself a skill.

564
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,720
Fucking sew that outfit yourself.

565
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Oh, that's good.

566
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,920
Get that, go to Joann Fabrics, get the tunic pattern

567
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,600
and some lovely prints and just make it for yourself.

568
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,200
I love that.

569
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,840
Fucking earn it.

570
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
And then if anyone tries to give you shit about it, be like, oh yeah, I made it.

571
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,120
Don't think of it as $80 you're only spending to dress up once in a great while.

572
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Think of it as an investment in post-apocalypse protection.

573
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Because after the revolution comes and the grid is shut down,

574
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,520
the man who spent all his time making armor and learning archery

575
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,880
are going to be the only ones worth a damn.

576
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,200
To get shot to death by the guy who bought a hundred guns.

577
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,560
No, guns won't work either.

578
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,680
I have a hundred guns.

579
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,320
What do you have?

580
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,600
I can make a doublet.

581
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,680
Well, okay, cool, cool.

582
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
I will trade you a gun for a doublet.

583
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Done.

584
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,720
That's called free market.

585
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,920
And then you shoot that man to death and take all his guns.

586
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Tailoring wins the day.

587
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,280
I want to go to the money zone.

588
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,560
You're listening to a podcast.

589
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
I know you like podcasts.

590
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,560
Don't try to trip.

591
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,000
I want you to subscribe to the Optimism Club podcast.

592
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,080
That's on iTunes and Stitcher.

593
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,440
That's with Steve Ball and Andy Ditchell.

594
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,560
They sit down and talk about what's new and exciting in the world.

595
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Possibly Dictal?

596
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,660
Digital?

597
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,360
Andy Digital, your digital co-host.

598
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
They talk about what's exciting in the world of pop culture.

599
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,480
Think like Max Headroom.

600
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,240
Yes, Steve, great joke.

601
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,440
Bitch, can I do my ad, please?

602
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,940
Thank you.

603
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
Jesus Christ.

604
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,960
It's not like this.

605
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,160
I bet they let each other finish fucking sentences

606
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,440
whilst they discuss everything from movies and TV comic books.

607
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,640
Anything you possibly nerd out about without fail,

608
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,240
they also spin off on borderline.

609
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,920
Insane tangents.

610
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,760
Like how every movie would be improved by introducing hyper intelligent apes.

611
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,320
I do agree on that front.

612
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,840
It's on iTunes.

613
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,120
It's on Stitcher.

614
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,480
Or you can like their Facebook page.

615
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,840
It's called the Optimism Club.

616
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
Catch it.

617
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,840
I want to talk to you guys about a very personal thing close to my heart

618
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,880
that I just learned about.

619
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,960
I demand actually that you donate to the Doodle Game Kickstarter.

620
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,280
You can go to doodlegame.com slash my brother for more info

621
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,960
and my bim bam fan doodles.

622
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,920
Now I should point out,

623
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,800
all these times I've said doodle,

624
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,360
I should have spelled it because it's actually D-U with an umlaut, D-L-E.

625
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,240
If you're just entering the URL, I don't think you have to hit the umlaut button.

626
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,040
Just D-U-D-L-E game.com will get you there.

627
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh my god.

628
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
These are amazing.

629
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,000
Doodle, pronounced doodle.

630
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,720
They pronounce it.

631
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,080
They provide a pronunciation guide.

632
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,200
I was about to call it doodle.

633
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,520
It's a party game of illustrating randomly generated phrases.

634
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,240
How do you play?

635
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,080
Each player draws five cards.

636
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,120
One adjective, two nouns, one verb and one adverb

637
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,680
and then tries to illustrate that phrase.

638
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,320
Can the other players guess your phrase based on your drawing?

639
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,840
If you like my bim bam laughing

640
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,320
and playing creative tabletop games with your friends,

641
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,560
then donate to the Doodle Game Kickstarter.

642
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,480
And like I said before,

643
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,520
you can check out some bim bam specific content at doodlegame.com slash my brother,

644
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,040
which I'm going to look at right now.

645
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,280
Yeah, yes.

646
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,160
Holy shit.

647
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,360
These are incredible.

648
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,040
There's tiny Amelie Pokemon singing sexily.

649
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,440
Okay.

650
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,720
There's a middle-est ghost horse shoplifting poorly.

651
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,840
Cosmic bear god devouring furiously.

652
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,120
Oh man, dirty corncob boy.

653
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,920
Warrior Pokemon juggalos sad living quietly.

654
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,200
Oh man.

655
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,160
Baby orb yahoo answering expertly.

656
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,040
Worried groundhog detective swiping dramatically.

657
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,240
All right, listen.

658
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,280
Go to this dirty corncob boy hiding Edward Snowden happily.

659
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,640
Oh, there's some good stuff.

660
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,520
Doodle game.

661
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,480
It's a d-u-d-l-e game dot com forward slash my brother dot html.

662
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh, that's great.

663
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,080
I want to play that.

664
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,360
Oh God, that's really funny.

665
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,920
Go, go look at that and kickstart their game.

666
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,960
God, I'm starving.

667
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,320
I need to eat before the show and I'm starving.

668
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,240
Do you want to like take a break?

669
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,400
No, I can't take a break.

670
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm too busy.

671
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,160
Do you want to eat these fatty corn chips and sloppy, slimy, fatty, greasy Doritos?

672
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm trying to lose weight Griffin, please help me.

673
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
And I bet they've got GMOs.

674
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,960
They hire stuff with GMOs, but I've heard online from a friend that I met online that

675
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,760
GMOs are good for you because they help your bones get stronger.

676
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,280
Incorrect.

677
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,000
That the only thing that's good for you in the world that you can trust is nature box

678
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,000
at nature box.com.

679
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,360
They've got delicious, nutritious, superstitious snacks that they send right to your door and

680
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,240
they're great for you and they're delicious.

681
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,800
They got BBQ kettle kernels, everything, bagel sticks, yeah, South Pacific plantain chips.

682
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,400
And they're healthy.

683
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,240
They do not pack with GMOs.

684
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,800
They're packed with superstitions.

685
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,240
What about my bones though?

686
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,560
Your bones will really enjoy eating everything.

687
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:45,640
Bagel sticks, BBQ kernels and our personal favorite salted caramel pretzel pops.

688
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,640
I want to try it, you know, I want to try it, but I don't want to pay full price.

689
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,160
Can anybody help me?

690
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,280
I can Justin.

691
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,520

00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,440
If you try nature box right now, you will get 50% off your first box.

694
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,240
Like there's a $30 box that I think contains 10 bags.

695
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,920
I should know because I just ordered it, but 10 bags for 30 bucks, 50% off $15.

696
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,360
It's an amazing deal.

697
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,360
You can choose your snacks and then they send you a new box every month and you can like

698
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,520
mix up the snacks and they're delicious.

699
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,800
They really are quite good.

700
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,640
Nature box.com slash my brother and you get 50% off go.

701
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,160
Okay, now I'm full, but you know what else?

702
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm bored.

703
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,720
Oh God, you are a fucking super needy guy.

704
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,600
Did you know that?

705
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,640
You're like a child.

706
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,680
Fill my holes industry.

707
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,560
Oh boy.

708
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,640
Fill the holes in my life capitalism.

709
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,480
Extreme restraints is not advertising with this episode.

710
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,520
Your holes will remain vacant.

711
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
Justin, do you like television?

712
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,480
What?

713
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,880
Yeah, I guess I like television.

714
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,560
I hate watching television because when is anything ever on?

715
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,840
I don't know when anything's on.

716
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,120
I know I'm paying for cables.

717
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,960
A real pain in the old patootie.

718
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,400
That's the end.

719
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,120
Next question.

720
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Our new secret fourth brother, Rosie O'Donnell, is really making a splash on this episode.

721
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,800
Here's the good news.

722
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,960
I've got a couch ball just rocking it out of my monitor and I had to dodge it the last second.

723
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,760
So what you need to do is sign up for Hulu Plus.

724
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,400
With Hulu Plus you get all the episodes of current seasons of stuff like Family Guy,

725
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,000
Parks and Recreation, Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and also like Community and South Park

726
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,360
shows that you already love and you can get them as new episodes come out.

727
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,160
And you can watch them on-

728
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,120
And now I'm fucking literally everything.

729
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,680
Travis, sometimes you sound so much like a commercial.

730
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,640
I think you must be reading something, but like you're not.

731
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,280
You're just-

732
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,320
Just flipping it off the dome.

733
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm just a fucking awesome salesman.

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,240
You're like half commercial and you can, they got original shows, right?

735
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,720
There's a new one I saw, a commercial for, while I was watching something else on Hulu

736
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,280
called Deadbeat, which is about a guy who smokes pot and can talk to ghosts.

737
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,640
And it's that dude from Reaper who was like the best part of that show Reaper.

738
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,520
That short-lived show Reaper that he was the best part of.

739
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,320
It's $7.99 a month and you can watch all these shows basically on any device that you want.

740
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,360
But if you sign up now at HuluPlus.com slash my brother, all one word,

741
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,800
you will get two weeks of full access totally free.

742
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,160
That is an extra week more than the standard demo period.

743
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,480
And you will get that extra week on us really luxuriating at HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

744
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,560
Hey, I'm Jesse Thorne from Maximumfun.org.

745
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,920
Last year, we got together with some of our favorite comedians and musicians and put them on a boat.

746
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
It was a huge success and we had such a great time.

747
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We've decided to do it again this summer.

748
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,160
The second annual Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival sets sail on July 25th,

749
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,400
though technically there are no sales.

750
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,720
Comedians will include W. Kamau Bell, Karen Kilgarriff, Greg Barrett,

751
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,240
Moshe Kasher, Kyle Kinane, Natasha Leggero and more.

752
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,760
Our music night is hosted by the great John Roderick of The Long Winters

753
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,400
and you can check out Jean Grey and others.

754
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,120
To learn more about the Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival and to book your passage,

755
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,720
visit boatparty.biz. The Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

756
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,680
Comedy. Music. Shuffleboard.

757
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,360
I have a co-worker who I share my position with who daily talks about having sex.

758
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,760
You can say it. It's fine. This is a safe space.

759
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:41,160
Our show has a teen rating on iTunes so we can say we can address these adult topics.

760
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:49,800
Having sex with his girlfriend or before that, just random girls.

761
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't want to hear his dirty board stories, but he seems to delight in bragging.

762
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,960
I have asked him to stop, but it only seems to make him enjoy it.

763
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,840
Oh God.

764
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,200
How do I get him to stop telling me about his late night escapades?

765
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,400
And that's from Don't Talk About Your Genitalia in Australia.

766
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,320
Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

767
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,360
It seems like the solution's in the question.

768
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,200
If only he enjoys it when you tell him not to talk about it,

769
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,120
you gotta beg him to talk about it.

770
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,280
Oh, more details.

771
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,760
How'd you-

772
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,640
Go on. Tell me about how you used your penis again.

773
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Who did you stick it to?

774
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Number the veins, Carlton.

775
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,440
Oh my God. God.

776
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,120
Who?

777
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,040
Paint a picture of my mind with these-

778
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
Numbers of details.

779
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,080
Numbers of veins?

780
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,320
Numbers of veins.

781
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,720
It was actually more upsetting to me that his name was Carlton.

782
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,600
That's-

783
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,240
Qualify the problem, Carlton.

784
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,760
That is my favorite Lewis Lowry book.

785
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
No. No.

786
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,520
Is it not okay?

787
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Cannot. Will not. Should not.

788
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,480
I think Travis is so right.

789
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,040
You have to beg for more details.

790
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,440
There is no verbal picture he will paint for you

791
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,000
that could ever be resplendent enough.

792
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,360
You have to continue to elicit adjectives from this man

793
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,160
until he can't adjectivize no more.

794
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,400
And when he's done, when he finishes the story,

795
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,760
he's like, yeah, I don't want to talk about it anymore.

796
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
You gotta look at him like,

797
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
and now I need you to really give it to her tonight

798
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,040
and remember every detail.

799
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,760
Really perform above and beyond, Carlton.

800
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,160
Come in tomorrow and tell me everything.

801
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,200
Bring a talk boy to the bedroom with you.

802
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Record your entire lovemaking session

803
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,120
and then transcribe it so we can discuss tomorrow.

804
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,720
A lot of pressure here, Carlton,

805
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,560
but I'm looking at you to be my big champ.

806
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,520
I want some Kinsey-ass fucking science, doc.

807
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,440
I want you to quantify every ounce of fluid.

808
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Don't you dare skip to the climax.

809
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,280
If only there was some sort of position,

810
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,920
some sort of position that we could invent right now

811
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,520
that would exist inside of a corporate sort of structure

812
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,040
that you could talk to and complain about your coworker

813
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,800
who's talking about his jizz sessions on the daily.

814
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
If only there was like, you know,

815
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,560
how there's like different positions like,

816
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,800
you know, receptionist and, you know, data management.

817
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,040
If only there was a position like that

818
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,360
that was like jizz complaint receiver.

819
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,680
What about executioner?

820
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,960
Like you're talking about the HR department.

821
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

822
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,360
You know what now?

823
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
Why haven't you done that?

824
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,120
That's like the obvious, it's like I cut my arm wide open.

825
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,600
What do I do?

826
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,480
Like you go to a doctor or you put a bandaid.

827
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,880
Like there's a thing to do already.

828
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,640
Now to be fair, to be fair,

829
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,760
this person does not list what industry they are in.

830
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,360
So it's quite possible that they exist in a business

831
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,680
in which there is no HR department.

832
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,600
There is no field, professional field,

833
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,000
you can work in where this behavior is acceptable.

834
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,280
Like none, except unless it's Dirty Story Boys,

835
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,880
the Dirty Story Boy Company, Inc. Co.

836
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,880
Where you only tell dirty stories to other boys.

837
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,920
That is the only business if you have made-

838
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,600
And it is thriving.

839
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
And it is fucking hopping.

840
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,920
Our next sponsor is Dirty Story Boys.

841
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,000
If you're a dirty boy and you love dirty stories,

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
come on down to Dirty Story Boys,

843
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,560
where we are gonna set you up with the dirtiest stories

844
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,000
and the dirtiest boys.

845
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,360
Every detail, number the veins, quantify the throbbing.

846
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,520
Also all your saltwater aquarium needs.

847
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,200
We also have accessories, come on down.

848
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,800
We're branching off.

849
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,080
I fucked this girl in college once

850
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,720
and it was real cool.

851
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,080
That will be $10.

852
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,640
For what?

853
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,960
What am I giving you $10 for?

854
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,200
Man, if you want more, you gotta pay more.

855
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,800
You know what I mean?

856
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,120
That was the $10 package.

857
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,040
Adjective free, two sentences.

858
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,000
That's what you get.

859
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,120
Once I watched that Showgirls movie

860
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,880
and it had that lady from Saved by the Bell in it

861
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,680
and I got my first boner, that will be $20.

862
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,480
Cause that was embarrassing.

863
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,680
Cause that was embarrassing.

864
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,040
That's a celebrity story.

865
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,120
That's a celeb porn story.

866
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,120
Celeb encounter.

867
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,400
That was a celeb encounter.

868
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,760
That's a special diamond package here at Dirty Boy Stories.

869
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,560
That will be $20.

870
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,600
That's $30.

871
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,360
I explained my business model to you,

872
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,160
which is in a way.

873
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,640
One time I saw Susan Sarandon taking a shower

874
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,880
but it turned out it was my aunt Diana

875
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,960
who only looks like Susan Sarandon.

876
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,320
That'll be a hundred dollars.

877
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,200
People love that.

878
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,920
That's a very specific audience,

879
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,280
but they'll gobble it up.

880
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,920
Sure.

881
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,440
30storyboys.mbmbam.

882
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,280
They're gonna give you your first story for free.

883
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,880
It won't be a great one.

884
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,680
It won't be a top of the line one.

885
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,000
Right.

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,520
It's gonna be a bottom tier.

887
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,320
You get a sampler.

888
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,720
Within the next month, I'm getting a new boss.

889
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,280
It was an internal hire outside my department,

890
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,760
but I see my soon to be supervisor every now and then.

891
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm personable.

892
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
I try to make small talk when I see him.

893
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,160
How's it going?

894
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,200
How are the kids?

895
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,480
Nonsense like that.

896
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,040
But he's not having it.

897
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,960
I'm talking minimal answers.

898
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,480
I don't want to be the best friends with the guy,

899
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,040
but I would like to know we can get along in my workplace.

900
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,680
Is there another way to gouge if Gage-

901
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,160
Wow.

902
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,660
Sorry.

903
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
Is there another way to gouge?

904
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
Is there a gouge?

905
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,800
Is there a gouge to work?

906
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
Is there a gouge to see if we're gonna work well together?

907
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,920
Can I trick him into being my work pal?

908
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,480
Or is it already effed and I should quit while I'm ahead?

909
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:13,980
Ugh.

910
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,360
Well, I mean, the obvious answer is some kind of whimsic old buddy road trip.

911
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,560
Somewhere you learn a lot about each other,

912
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,840
but a lot about yourself, Stu.

913
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,720
Do a full New England Applebee's tour.

914
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,400
Can you try to give him an organ?

915
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,440
Like, does he need an organ or maybe he wants a backup organ?

916
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,840
Or try to steal one of his organs and then, like,

917
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
blackmail him to be friends with you to get it back.

918
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,480
These are all-

919
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,040
That's pretty good.

920
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,720
Tremendous suggestions.

921
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:41,960
I don't-

922
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,480
I haven't worked in an office since I was fucking 17 years old.

923
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,160
So if you-

924
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,680
Oh, I do a Jimmy Buffett.

925
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,080
Jesus.

926
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,880
If you would count-

927
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,280
It don't even mention that dude's name.

928
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,000
Listen, everyone.

929
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,880
It happened again.

930
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,160
We ate a pound of shit from people by offending them.

931
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,480
First, it was jugglers.

932
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,920
And then it was Jimmy Buffett fans.

933
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,280
We did it again.

934
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,640
Didn't think that there was that big of an audience.

935
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,320
Big audience for that, but apparently-

936
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,920
I think they prefer paired heads.

937
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,720
And also, I like Jimmy Buffetts.

938
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

939
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm going to do a live edition of Boat Drinks when we go to New York.

940
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,440
Oh, fuck that.

941
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,720
So let me bring me a guitar so I can-

942
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,480
You can do that during the Justin show.

943
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,200
What I'm saying is I don't think you can make anyone be your friend under any circumstances.

944
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,680
Like, especially if you're fucking working together.

945
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,720
But why do you give a shit?

946
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,320
Well, here's the thing.

947
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,880
I'm going to draw some knowledge that in your question, you gave me the hint.

948
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,320
I need to solve this problem.

949
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,560
When you say that you ask him how it's going and how are the kids and nonsense like that,

950
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,040
that says to me that you're clearly not interested in his answers.

951
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
You're just trying to gauge if he likes you or not.

952
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,000
And that's going to come across as really insincere and that's not very likable.

953
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,640
I would say you should be interested in him and ask questions you want to know the answers to.

954
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,760
Travis is echoing the sentiments of Uncle Dale, Carnegie that is.

955
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,120
The only way to make friends is to get genuinely accent on that word.

956
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,760
They're interested in other people.

957
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,440
If you're not actually interested and you're just like saying platitudes or idle chit chat

958
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,440
for chit chat sake, then it's not going to build an actual relationship.

959
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
You got to get actually interested in the guy.

960
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,040
And if he's not, you know, if he's not interesting, then find something.

961
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,360
Everybody's got something that's interesting about them.

962
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,880
Find something, get interested in it.

963
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,840
And that's the only real way to build a friendship like that.

964
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,640
And then once you started that, then you drop some negs.

965
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,880
Got it.

966
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,680
A few negs.

967
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,760
I mean, also keep in mind he's your boss.

968
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,320
Like you don't have to be friends.

969
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,920
Of course, everybody wants to be liked and everybody wants to be on good terms with people.

970
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,160
But like so you guys aren't like best friends going to see movies on the weekends together.

971
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,440
So what, he's your boss and it's a professional relationship more than anything else.

972
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,560
So that's probably okay.

973
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,040
Just make sure he doesn't hate you.

974
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,800
The only reason to be friends with your boss is so you can get away with more shit.

975
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,920
And I think bosses know that full well.

976
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,160
So their hearts are hardened.

977
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,600
You got to break through.

978
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,520
They're so cold and dead inside.

979
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,600
You got to genuinely like this guy first.

980
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:26,200
You have to genuinely like this person and get actually, actually interested in this person.

981
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,840
But that's the only way that you're going to actually make a relationship.

982
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,640
That's what you want to do.

983
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,160
I don't know what to add to this.

984
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,400
No, we nailed it.

985
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,640
Yeah.

986
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,000
I mean, got it at one.

987
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,760
Y'all want a Yahoo?

988
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:41,880
Please.

989
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,480
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

990
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,000
It is asked by, and now that field isn't even loading.

991
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,400
Hey, Yahoo Answers, you did a great job on your website.

992
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,240
You did a real good job.

993
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,000
You brought in some real experts.

994
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,800
It's like fucking healthcare.gov all over again.

995
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,800
I feel like all signs are pointing to us needing to abandon Yahoo Answers.

996
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:11,000
Like not only is Yahoo dropping the ball, but everybody decided that like, oh, these are like,

997
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,840
oh, these are like every week I see, and there was a guy on like BuzzFeed this week.

998
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,280
It's like, you'll love this guy's hilarious Yahoo Answers responses.

999
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,120
Like, yeah, hi, is it 2010 again or no?

1000
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,440
Okay.

1001
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,120
He's pretty late to the party.

1002
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,920
This, this, this field has been mined.

1003
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,280
By us.

1004
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,800
By us.

1005
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,280
It's done.

1006
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:32,680
We straight mined it.

1007
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,960
We came in, we gave the farmer $10 for the ore within his land, and he was like,

1008
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,040
oh, I've got $10 and then we've taken all of it and left his fields fallow.

1009
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,600
We salted the earth.

1010
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,880
Now, I mean, there's still people.

1011
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,880
There's some fucking shamans, some Yahoo shamans out there doing spiritual work, reviving,

1012
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,600
reviving the lands, the mother earth.

1013
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,880
Drew Davenport is a level six shaman and he speaks directly to comedy Gaia

1014
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,800
and he gets a lot of product out of this, this fallow field.

1015
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,120
Now what do you find in this fallow ass field?

1016
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,640
Uh, thank you, Drew.

1017
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,120
I can't tell you who fucking asked it because this website won't load.

1018
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,920
So I'm going to say it was asked by Drew Davenport.

1019
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,000
Who asks, is stuffing shoes with socks noticeable?

1020
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,200
I stuffed my shoes with socks daily to give me a bit of extra height.

1021
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,520
It's not uncomfortable walking, but sometimes I notice I walk like one of my legs are sore.

1022
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,480
It adds about two inches to my shoe height, making me almost 5'11 with shoes on.

1023
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,200
I always get the impression people are looking at me and I am constantly looking behind me.

1024
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,600
My friend is about 5'8 and he uses regular insoles to make him 5'10.

1025
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,720
We are both 16.

1026
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,320
What?

1027
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,000
People noticed before and I was so embarrassed they were mocking me for days in school,

1028
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,440
but despite this, I still do it.

1029
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,800
What?

1030
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,160
I guess, first of all, you asked a question about whether it was noticeable

1031
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,560
and instead people noticed it in front of you.

1032
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,800
So, yes.

1033
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,400
Can someone help me through the actual procedure?

1034
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,600
I'm having trouble parsing this.

1035
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,720
What kind of shoes are you wearing that there's an extra like two inches in there?

1036
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,120
Two inches of space in there.

1037
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,440
What kind of shoes are we talking about?

1038
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,200
This is obviously clown school, right?

1039
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,600
It's Stomper's school.

1040
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,280
Stomper's University.

1041
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,840
When I put just like normal like arch support insoles in my shoes,

1042
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,920
I noticed it's a little tight.

1043
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,120
That's like an eighth of an inch of material.

1044
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:38,360
Yeah.

1045
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,040
I don't know if this person is talking about wearing a lot of socks

1046
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:48,280
or if they just put the socks under where their foot goes in the shoe cavity,

1047
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,840
in the shoe hole.

1048
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
I don't think this person knows how big an inch is.

1049
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,760
That's the only thing that makes sense.

1050
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah.

1051
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,960
Yeah, I have to amount to two inches.

1052
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,200
That's significant.

1053
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,640
That's Frankenstein shoes.

1054
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:01,880
Yeah.

1055
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,160
Unless you have lifts and those go like under the like in the sole.

1056
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,440
I am upset.

1057
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,720
It's a special shoes.

1058
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,200
Hey, do you guys remember Forrest Gump?

1059
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,440
It's been a long time since America's consciousness has thought about that fool.

1060
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,840
Hey, I'm re-released that on Blu-ray.

1061
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,800
Travis, I got some.

1062
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,160
Check this out.

1063
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,520
Okay.

1064
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,320
Check this out.

1065
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,360
Shrimp.

1066
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:34,840
Nice.

1067
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,040
I got one for you.

1068
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,360
How about that?

1069
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,760
Wait, hold on.

1070
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,560
I got one.

1071
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,080
I got no legs, Forrest.

1072
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,800
Okay.

1073
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,960
Well, I don't get that one.

1074
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,920
My legs are gone.

1075
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:47,960
What is that?

1076
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,080
I'm a lieutenant.

1077
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,840
Oh.

1078
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm Lieutenant Daniel.

1079
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,680
I'm Lieutenant Daniel.

1080
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,320
Sergeant Daniel.

1081
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,120
The UK Forrest Gump has a silent U in his name.

1082
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,000
Magic shoes.

1083
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,320
Crikey.

1084
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,360
Get your magic shoes here, guv.

1085
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,120
Seats taken, guv.

1086
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,160
I got boiled prawns.

1087
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,280
I got stewed fried prawns.

1088
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,720
Butter battered prawns.

1089
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,680
Jellied prawns.

1090
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,240
Salt caked prawns.

1091
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,640
Farm raised prawns.

1092
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,880
Herched prawns.

1093
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,680
Come on out to my pruning board, Forrest.

1094
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,800
Forrest.

1095
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,320
Forrest Gump.

1096
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,920
Oh, god.

1097
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,440
Can I tell you something about that movie?

1098
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,280
Can I tell you something about British Forrest Gump?

1099
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,440
Sally Fields would still be in it, and she would still be fucking transcendent.

1100
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,680
She would still be incredible.

1101
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,160
Fuck me.

1102
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,760
Oh, man.

1103
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,760
Stupid magic shoes.

1104
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,320
Dumb show.

1105
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,160
Dumb, dumb, dumb show.

1106
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,880
Uh, thank you so much for listening to our, uh, to our podcast.

1107
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,280
My brother, my brother and me, we hope you had a good time.

1108
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,720
Some fun, some laughs.

1109
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,480
Um, thank you so much to people tweeting about the show with the MB, MB, AM hashtag

1110
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:31,080
like Jordan, Paul, Blistifer, Fenton's dad, BTA, Schmoozy, Sir Bunnington, uh,

1111
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:40,920
uh, Louisa Heron, Don Chapel, uh, comedy podcasts, Sarah the cat, Austin Grismore,

1112
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,880
and many, many others.

1113
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,200
Were you just being, were you being generic then and just like thanking comedy podcasts?

1114
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,480
No, that's an actual, we've talked about comedy podcasts before.

1115
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,320
The Twitter account, comedy podcasts.

1116
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,760
Thanks, everybody's already started sending in, uh, emails and questions for the live shows.

1117
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,400
Although, uh, I would stress that when you send them in, don't just put question for

1118
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,360
the live show.

1119
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,280
We're doing three of them.

1120
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,400
People, please specify which one you're going to be at.

1121
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,960
Um, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song

1122
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,600
instead of departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1123
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
Great little album, a lot of great tunes, a lot of great tracks.

1124
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:29,000
I suggest listening to track, uh, four and six and nine are my personal favorites.

1125
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:38,040
Um, I want to remind everybody that, uh, there are still plenty of, uh, fantastic seats or

1126
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:46,120
I guess cabins available for the, uh, for the Atlantic ocean comedy and music festival

1127
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,120
at boat party dot biz.

1128
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:55,240
Uh, they, uh, had just announced that they added Tony Cayman, Carol Kolb, Guy Branham

1129
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,560
and James Adamian.

1130
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,280
Adamian?

1131
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,480
That sounds right.

1132
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,160
Yeah, I'm going to go with that.

1133
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,680
Uh, and they already had said that, uh, Chris Fairbanks is going to be there.

1134
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,880
Moshe Kasher, Kyle Kinane, Morgan Murphy, like, and John Roderick, which you might remember

1135
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,000
from 30 seconds ago.

1136
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,040
It's going to be huge.

1137
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,560
It's going to be a lot of fun.

1138
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,080
Uh, there's going to be comedy and there's going to be music and it's going to make you

1139
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,560
really, really happy because you're going to set sail from port Canaveral and spend

1140
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,840
three nights in the Bahamas, July 25th, 28th at boat party dot biz.

1141
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,400
Sounds terrible.

1142
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,200
Who'd want to do that?

1143
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,320
Catch it.

1144
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,800
I want to say thanks again to our friends at nature box, um, where you can get a box

1147
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,480

1148
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,760

00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,520
Griffin, do you have a last question?

1153
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,120
I do have a final one that you can chew on appropriate for reasons you'll understand

1154
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,920
here in a second.

1155
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,720
I'm just saying that what you just said is appropriate to the subject matter of the

1156
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,120
question.

1157
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,880
So it's kind of funny how life works out sometimes, isn't it?

1158
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,720
It is funny.

1159
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,560
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1160
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,280
Thank you, Jacob.

1161
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Duncan who asks, is Jack Link's beef jerky bad for you?

1162
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

I'm Griffin.

1165
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,600
You said chew on it and then beef jerky is like sort of a sinewy shoot.

1166
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,120
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1167
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:50,600

We break it down so it can forever be broken.

1181

Hilarious jokes.

1182
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,800
Plus sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

1183
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,080
Sometimes there's a dog here.

1184
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:38,200
We'll see you in your earbuds.
