00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hey everybody, Merry Candle Lights.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,200
It's your oldest brother Justin McElroy here.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,260
And here's your babiest,

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,920
baby, baby, baby, Griffin McElroy.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,760
Hi.

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Happy holidays, Griffin.

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,880
Happy holidays to you, my good friend Justin.

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,440
So we're fresh off the, dare I say, triumph.

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,720
Do we sound hungover?

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
Cause we is.

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, we is hangover.

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,080
We're fresh off the triumph of Candle Lights 2014.

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
Thank you to everybody who came to the show

14
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,680
here at Huntington City Hall.

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,640
You're about to listen to the show right now.

16
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,680
I think you'll be pleased.

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,040
I think it's the best audio quality

18
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,960
we've gotten from a live show basically ever.

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,420
A wonderful surprise.

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,180
Better than the audio quality of the people

21
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,020
who are actually there.

22
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,320
Which if you're there and you couldn't,

23
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,000
you had trouble hearing us, sorry about that.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,360
The room was built long before

25
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,720
amplified sound had been invented.

26
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,520
And so I guess that maybe there's a lot of echoing.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,400
So sorry about that.

28
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,640
Listen to it now and maybe you'll get the goose

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
that you missed the first time around.

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,700
Speaking of missed goose,

31
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,480
since you're not physically there,

32
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,240
a few things you should know.

33
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
At the beginning, our dad is dressed

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
like his character from the Adventure Zone,

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,280
our D&D podcast.

36
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,000
So if you hear people laughing, that is why.

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Also he's just a silly looking man.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,960
Just so in general.

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,560
And that is, what else do they need?

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
Oh, we were dressed as the ghosts of Christmas

41
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
from A Christmas Carol.

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,440
So if you hear us referencing that.

43
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,560
That's what that was.

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,040
I'm sure you can find images of that.

45
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,880
Yeah, just do a Twitter search.

46
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean, I don't want to introduce more work

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
into our podcast.

48
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,800
Listening to our podcast is already work.

49
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,040
It's kind of a chore.

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
So hoarse.

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,760
So hoarse, aren't we?

52
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,960
I know, it's a long night.

53
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,720
But we hope you enjoy the live show.

54
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,040
We'll be back in the middle

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,640
to talk about a couple sponsors.

56
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,100
But it's an extra-long episode,

57
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,940
so make sure to catch up on that too.

58
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,760
And it's clean.

59
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,600
It's clean.

60
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,660
If you want to share it with family,

61
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,740
might be kind of a weird one

62
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,000
since it was a live environ.

63
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,200
But we hope you enjoyed it.

64
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
Oh, and we also got a day named after us.

65
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,440
Yes.

66
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,260
By the mayor of Huntington.

67
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,100
By the mayor.

68
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,360
December 20, yesterday felt different to you.

69
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
It was because December 21st, 2014

70
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
was NBNBAM day in Huntington.

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
That's true.

72
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,100
That's not like a goof.

73
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,120
We got a proclamation.

74
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,320
It was signed and stamped and delivered.

75
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
So there you go.

76
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,060
There it is.

77
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,560
So anyway, that's gonna do it for us right now.

78
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
Hope you enjoy the show.

79
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
We'll be back with you in just a few minutes.

80
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Thank you.

81
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,080
I am Merle Highchurch of the popular podcast,

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,740
The Adventure Zone.

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,780
You can tell because of my dwarfy voice.

84
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,080
The Adventure Zone,

85
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,460
one of the four most popular podcasts in existence.

86
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,860
All right, let's get down to business.

87
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,680
Yeah.

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,260
Did you wash your hands when you were done?

89
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
No.

90
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,640
Let us begin.

91
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,800
The McElroy brothers are not experts

92
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,500
and their advice should never be followed.

93
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,920
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

95
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,200
Also, this show isn't for kids.

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Well, this show kinda is for young adults.

97
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,560
This show isn't for real little kids,

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,420
which I only mentioned so the babies out there

99
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,360
will know how cool they are for listening.

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
What's up, you cool babies?

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,640
What's up, you cool babies?

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Hi.

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,460
Hi.

104
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,280
Hi.

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,120
Hey.

106
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,960
He was at half masked before,

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
but now we can begin.

108
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,260
Hello.

109
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,180
knew how many dubstep Christmas songs. There's a lot. You can fade the dubstep out, it's pretty

110
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:52,820
terrible. Infinity dubstep Christmas songs. Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

111
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,180
And I'm the lead singer of the Polyphonic Spree apparently tonight. I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm going

112
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,420
to have to take my mask off because my breath is fogging up my glasses because I'm the coolest kid.

113
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,020
Yeah let's, does everybody have that out of their system? You get it? Can we take, okay.

114
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,740
I can't, wait, hold on. I can't take off. This is like caked on for a week. I'm gonna be opening

115
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,060
my presents like this. Oh we should say listeners at home, we had a hilarious opening bit where we

116
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,620
were dressed as the ghosts and Justin, he has a lovely green robe and a... Are you gonna garrison

117
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Keylor this whole thing or can we just do the show? I remember in Lake Wobegon when three brothers

118
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,420
would really earn attention. If you're listening and you're not here, I'm wearing like a cool pair

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,820
of slacks that I got from Neiman Marcus and like a like a fashionable trendy but not too trendy

120
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,580
plaid shirt and then like a square cut wool tie. I look awesome. He looks really great. You know

121
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,380
what I actually learned? I'm wearing gaudy white face paint. Do you know how when you get a tan

122
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,060
and it makes your teeth look whiter? The opposite happens.

123
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,100
With that, what was the first thing we were going to talk about? All the show prep just

124
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,060
because the first bit worked so good that I was like man that was funny and that's all I can

125
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,140
think about right now. I spent 85 dollars on this costume all together. 90s are expensive.

126
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,740
Another thing I learned, 90s are expensive and that I wear an extra extra large in women's

127
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,620
for 90s. Perfect. These things are hard to urinate around but I suppose that's not really their

128
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,980
intended purpose. Should we start doing advice? Well the first thing I wanted to talk about just

129
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,180
to lead off is just a thank you that it's my brother, my brother and me. Happy my bim bam day

130
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:57,700
everybody. Happy my bim bam day. I cannot stress to you, goofs aside, let's get genuine. That was

131
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,780
a real honor. It was a really sweet thing. What an honor that was. It was like a really sweet thing

132
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,460
and it was emotional like this is my hometown you know. I love Huntington but I noticed on the

133
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:14,900
proclamation that it says that December the 21st 2014 is my bim bam day. It is not an annual

134
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,980
occurrence and that's you know fine. Most people don't even get the one day. I do wish the mayor

135
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:31,780
had told me in the morning that I got a day. That's like a snow day when you sleep till 11

136
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,220
and it's like I missed half the snow day. To be more accurate it's like a snow day but you just

137
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,740
went to class for like seven hours. It's like I got four hours of my special day left and I'm

138
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,980
gonna spend it in clown makeup. Fantastic. Oh wait hold on hold on hold on. It's a huge honor.

139
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:56,260
Huge oh my god. Huge honor no question. But what rights and privileges do you think we've earned

140
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,100
from this? For the next uh three hours you're asking? Yeah like free fruit at every vendor.

141
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Like I don't know. Yeah at the fruit vendor. You know you know the fruit vendor.

142
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,900
Huge fruit vendor population. I'm just saying I wish the mayor had had shook me awake at one in

143
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,420
the morning. I don't know why he would be there. Griffin it's Steve. Griffin wake up it's Steve

144
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,420
you're missing it. Um I wish Steve had shook me away. He's got a key to the city he can open any

145
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:37,300
door. That's a great point. You look radical right now Justin. I'm saying my Justin is my fat Jesus

146
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,260
look. He's removed his fat Jesus beard and now he's just got fat Jesus hair and he looks uh

147
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,260
it looks pretty awesome. I this is the fullest embrace I could do of Jimmy Buffett style without

148
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,860
actually going to like his concerts. I hope you guys enjoyed the Buffett buffet in the waiting

149
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,700
interim uh that Justin definitely put together for you. I slaved over that playlist it only had

150
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,020
two James Buffett songs. Can we answer some questions? Okay uh who here has never listened

151
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:12,900
to My Brother My Brother Me before? Oh god wow so no one wondered off the streets of Huntington.

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:21,860
I heard one woo that started like uh so we have an advice show uh for the modern era and now

153
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:31,140
like Chilean miners we will emerge from no Chilean miners aren't still hot.

154
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,780
Well no. You know what it's candle nights do it again I'm gonna lean into it. Okay like Chilean

155
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,460
miners emerging from the ground. It's been 38 minutes can we answer a question? Yeah um we

156
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,180
turn your questions alchemy like into wisdom it's what we do here on the show uh so let's take some

157
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,420
of your questions uh some of you may be in the audience uh so if you uh hear your question

158
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:06,820
and start listening because we're gonna answer it and we're not gonna read it twice and if you

159
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,340
don't hear your question it was bad. You did a bad job. Maybe next candle nights although next

160
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,060
year is a candle night sleeping. Candle nights 2015. No candle nights next year but 2016 you

161
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,420
come back double hard. Every four and a half years. I have a close family this is the question

162
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:32,980
I the it's not me I have a close family member who often indulges in the eggnog a bit too much

163
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:40,180
during the candle nights it could be me it's not but it could be this often results in wackiness

164
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:48,820
followed by awkwardness then sadness like a clown like a clown Travis yes how do you deal with the

165
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,140
deal with the awkward situation of someone drinking a bit too much during the holidays

166
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,860
fun starter super fun opener for our comedy holiday podcast designated driver in dirty jersey

167
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:13,060
are you here perfect no cool lol um you know when you think someone is drinking too much at a holiday

168
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,700
party what you really have on your hands is a question of perspective because you're not

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:30,660
drinking enough unless you are as you literally just said 20 seconds ago the designated driver

170
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,460
that that was for either that was just a little bit any other episode any other episode would

171
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,060
have put a swear word in there but i didn't because it's candle you you you guys are missing

172
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,700
the best part of this situation what's that so the hardest thing about candle nights is not knowing

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:55,780
what to get someone right right right i guess yeah there's a lot of rituals it's a made-up fake

188
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:34,820
yes this one was sent in by liana calon who asks how big are elves

189
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,620
my dad and i are arguing about this

190
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,900
he says that they are all little people that's not what they said yahoo you need to learn some

191
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:59,380
stuff about uh they are all little people like the kevlar elves okay ah man wait is that a thing

192
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:08,580
yeah it's elves that like a swat team elf yeah go go go go go go blasted slice by slice the pie

193
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,860
you would think the tree you would think the tree would stop the bullet and it wouldn't even get

194
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:22,260
anyway uh they have to protect the elf president sure they are all little people like the kevlar

195
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,380
elves and i say that some are human sized like legolas she doesn't believe me okay

196
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,700
this person is proposing because they say some are legolas size which would mean that there are

197
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:44,340
different there are different phylum of elves but there are elves that are both keyboard elves

198
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,740
kevlar kevlar elves oh maybe it's a maybe it's a copyright problem kevlar elves y'all know what i

199
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:58,100
mean wink you get it but on the deep ones but the idea that there are some that are legolas

200
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,140
size and some that are kevlar size legolas was not have you seen the movies he's not this tall

201
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,580
he was like wicked tall he was like super big he's a really big dude which is funny because

202
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:17,300
orlando bloom is big yeah he's uh he's knee high to a frog uh uh do you think that maybe

203
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,380
they're interspersed at the north pole you roll up and like every fifth one is kevlar sized and

204
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,220
the rest is just all orlando blooms as far as the eye can see that would make that would be a much

205
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,260
different uh sheen on the children's movies when kids get whisked away magically to the north pole

206
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,260
to santa's factory you imagine opening the door it's just 28 just a 28 year old dude sup hey

207
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,700
you want me to make a toy or what what do you need you just want to hang playstation vita i've got a

208
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,380
block of wood and a hammer that's about the best i can do um those are two tools i have

209
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,140
can i make it something with that maybe maybe they're partners and you need the kevlar owls

210
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,180
to do the little detail the two hickeys okay legolas is do the body work yeah they do like

211
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,620
the the big parts they build the case and then the camera and everyone like every elf is assigned his

212
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,540
buddy elf oh my god and if one dies the other one has to kill themselves exactly it's a life bond

213
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,500
between a big alpha to the north bowl i just also i need you to sign this this death don't

214
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,020
pay attention to the fine print we've had some staffing issues lately the kevlar elves lifespan

215
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:44,340
is 15 years and the legless is 85 so what i'm saying is i guess live it up i'm santa

216
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:54,660
how many hr issues that's why he leaves christmas eve is the one night a year santa just can't take

217
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:01,940
it anymore what is this factory i've set up what have i done with my life i get so many blooms

218
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:10,900
wasted i get attached to elves that die after 15 years i kill beautiful 28 year old men i've killed

219
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:20,020
so many legs i gotta get out of the house it's christmas eve the cookies will make me forget

220
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,540
about the terrible system elizabeth town was such a bad movie for him to go out on

221
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,300
that movie was garbage how many hr violations do you think you'd run into

222
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,860
at an all orlando bloom work facility because i would i would discover that magic kingdom i

223
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,620
would just roll and run through just pinching cheeks like that like their cheeks

224
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,220
but then i hit a i hit a kevlar elf and i'd be like snap and i break his neck no

225
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,420
and then you have to kill and then you have to kill the bloom

226
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:03,940
for balance um and that's elf on the shelf too and that's the plot of elf on the shelf too god

227
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,980
justin i just realized you're not wearing an undershirt either you've got a lot of looks

228
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,340
going on travis you look great too but no uh do you want to read another question

229
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,100
our extended family holiday gatherings are the usual affair

230
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,780
christmas after stuffing ourselves on massive masses of food our sweet nana

231
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:34,420
has forced an extensive carol sing into a tradition needless to say everyone hates it

232
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:42,100
but even worse hang in there even worse is the fact that she just sits there refusing to sing

233
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:50,980
while silently judging our worth as her progeny based on how the third how into the third verse

234
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:58,660
of good king winseless we are how do we get out of this without poisoning the mashed potatoes

235
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:07,220
it's a dark turn at the end musically morose in ontario canada okay i didn't realize that was a

236
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:13,220
method of murder i thought that was like a fun idiom like uh oh i really poisoned the mashed

237
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,460
potatoes this time huh you thought the canadians just had completely different idioms from us

238
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,020
man i'm sorry you guys i tried to get it done on time but i really played my grandma on that one

239
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:31,220
uh i'm just imagining this like emperor palpatine-esque figure just like sitting on a

240
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:42,100
throne just like yes yes this pleases me my puppets of flesh really hit the high sea skylar

241
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,540
sing to nana my angels of music angela sing for me

242
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:57,300
sorry what is this character it's it's the nana i thought that was clear from context

243
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:06,180
i just wanted to hear you say it's the nana um i want you to own it oh god i don't i'm just

244
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,140
gonna pretend that this isn't an actual thing that happens in the world because it makes me

245
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,740
so uncomfortable thinking about it is it possible wait maybe nana doesn't tell you where she is in

246
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,220
the room and it's like elf on the shelf you have to find your nana and she's spying on you somewhere

247
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,060
watching you sing and you don't know where she's in the cabinet like the baba duke

248
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,340
is your grandma baba duke we didn't even consider the possible duke no

249
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,260
is it possible that that your nana knows how much you all hate it but you all piss her off

250
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:49,700
so much it's like i i'm old sing the song again did oh oh he stopped it he stopped he stopped

251
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,140
that was good but you have to play it out like a different word that's the game you didgeridoo

252
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,020
okay that's good that's pretty good so hard we should set up a swear jar where if we swear

253
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,700
we have to put fifty thousand dollars into like a savings account and the first one of us that dies

254
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,420
dies gets it no hold on for every one of us that dies you put another fifty thousand in

269
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:03,460
user asked grandma got run over by a reindeer seriously by the way my super smooth transition

270
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,500
went right in the toilet um do you think this song is disrespectful to grandmothers

271
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,740
or just or just a nonsensical song simply meant to make people laugh

272
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,420
why do you think the author chose grandma instead of grandpa or any other person

273
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,900
would you play or sing this song in your grandma's company

274
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,380
in case you've never heard all the lyrics because everyone's always laughing

275
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,060
are they though throughout the entire duration of the number grandma got

276
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,860
okay i can't hear it

277
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,740
is she okay okay i need to know the backstory to enjoy the song show of applause who unironically

278
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:06,740
has ever laughed at grandma got run over by a reindeer exactly no come on that was even

279
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:15,620
ironic i heard it like yeah i don't want to leave him hanging sure uh god i think my favorite part

280
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,820
of this question is the idea of it being disrespectful to the nana and that idea of

281
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:33,300
like it comes on the radio or your playlist you're like oh oh god she's watching you're out of the

282
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:42,660
wheel it's too late it's too late i don't know why i have my hands like nosferatu there arnani

283
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:53,460

286
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,660
podcast of my brother my brother and me uh if you ever want to really amp up the difficulty

287
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:23,540
of your life record a podcast for four years where you talk about basically the most horrible

288
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,540
things you can imagine that you can't imagine i think it comes to us from another realm then

289
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:39,780
do a christmas show in your hometown full of people then drink not a considerable amount

290
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:52,580
of whiskey backstage then put your nani in the second row best of luck no pressure no pressure

291
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,300
does the grandma die and grandma get run over by a reindeer

292
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,740
is anyone familiar hold on i'll ask and then went through extensive physical therapy

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,780
grandma kissing santa claus and then leaving with him and i never saw her again uh we have

311
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,540
literally just described a big part of this job is she's not like me she's gonna come a lot more

312
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:16,900
than once a year you know what's up santa look up your chimney i got your girl it's me santa

313
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:25,460
i'm done a big part of this job ho ho ho is to come up with like allegories and illusions

314
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,620
that's basically the subtitle of the show um this is not one of them

315
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,380
that is literally and exactly the plot of misery

316
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,260
i was gonna say overboard no it's misery it's misery for sure y'all uh that is literally the

317
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,300
bottom mystery was we just did yahoo let's get a general question we're gonna dip in

318
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,500
to well we're gonna have to fix the mic because our dad broke it with his good with his hilarious

319
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,660
goof was it worth it dad i think it was uh but we are gonna have some questions from the audience

320
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,620
just a few uh because you guys are very far away from us and we maybe didn't think about that

321
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:11,060
beforehand so start thinking about not a bummer holiday themed holiday themed without swearing

322
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:19,460
i swear to god that's okay we can take the word okay um that if anyone breaks our streak up if

323
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:28,180
we get a baba booey up here i will lose my mind because we've traveled back in time baba boo is

324
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:35,700
still a super hot cultural reference justin bring me a hot cue off that list uh we're on the third

325
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,100
one ahem ahem whiskey's catching up with papa for the past five years a friend and i would

326
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,380
exchange gifts for no no it's not funny you goofed on it i meant the real third one with

327
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,900
the star next to it that we use that was our clever code to say these are good questions

328
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,060
did you see the star and you're like wonder what that means oh well how did that get there

329
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,460
uh this face paint is so hot it's like i have 15 extra layers of skin on my face

330
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,460
what you don't know is it's lead based oh great read the question justin right last christmas

331
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,980
um i come from a multi-faith family so we celebrate christmas and hanukkah there's

332
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,460
a name for that it's christmica uh what is the best way to fit candle nights in our

333
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:32,900
already packed holiday schedule that's from dreidels and donner in dallas i think that

334
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:40,900
candle nights solves i mean candle night solves a lot of problems just like worldwide but eventually

335
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:51,140
it will eat both christmas and hanukkah for nourishment and will keep growing and pretty

336
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,340
soon it's going to be the only game in town and if you think he's being figurative then you do

337
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:02,420
know you don't understand candle the physiology of candle nights the old one that is candle nights

338
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:10,900
the elder god that is that we have to feed lesser holidays to that's why we appease him to last

339
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,540
another millennium that is why mayor steve williams came up with my brother my brother and me day

340
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:24,420
it was not to honor us it was to keep him asleep dark unnamed uh uh far far below the mantle of

341
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:31,780
the earth uh another quick candle night snow as you know candle nights is a pan-religious pansexual

342
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:40,180
personal pan holiday uh that we made up for ourselves so everybody could have a party together

343
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:47,780
uh we know we have a lot of christmas imagery on stage that is not no tiny ten was jewish

344
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:56,340
fair enough fine that's not for lack of trying griffin and i scoured every store in the tri-state

345
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:07,060
area that was we went to the target we went to the target at mary creek and i tell you it's

346
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,420
ironically for god's chosen people you don't have a lot of selection

347
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:18,500
that i didn't see a single uh menorah or any sort of hanukkah decoration i should have grabbed it

348
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,380
while i was in cincinnati we were at a cvs and saw a kid this story is about the time you saw a

349
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:33,940
menorah i'm going to lose it no we saw can you believe it no um where do they get off what no

350
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,900
we saw a kit for a hanukkah house which is a gingerbread house can they not just accept the

351
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:48,900
icing is blue and white terrific nice try gingerbread house empire wait uh what was the

352
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,780

429
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:41,540
but but don't encourage him there's nothing funny about it whatsoever we have sustained

430
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,180
the elder gods to a point where we can manifest our own will in the material plane so because

431
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:56,020
of that power we have eradicated it from existence you're welcome everybody but i want to apologize

merry candlelight to all and to all a good worst thing that happens in the podcast

467
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:14,020
thank you all thank you all for sitting through the last sad libs ever and now it's canonical

468
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:22,900
how long have you been going like three years a lot of people do the this isn't funny but

469
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,180
we're doing it anyway but not a lot of people have the strength of will to commit

470
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:34,660
to really not making it funny we're not it's not a goof it's really not in any way entertaining

471
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:40,580
griffin and i are joking for the poetry yeah you yeah uh maybe if we do a few

472
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,500
more huntington live shows they'll name you like poet laureate of huntington west virginia

473
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,780
uh i got a yadru for everybody if you're into that

474
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:58,740
yeah this yadru mystery nights was sent in by drew davenport thank you level 8000

475
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,180
yadru shaman drew davenport it's asked by yahoo answers i forgot i can't see

476
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,620
that data because i am not connected to the website

477
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:30,260
it's just craig question mark craig craig craig asked if you gave people your greatest gift

478
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,180
what would that be i just did no

479
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:41,940
oh you better hope you didn't it's all i've got

480
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:52,740
my best gift then in that in that context would be a a sharp editor's eye a keen eye on the uh

481
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:58,820
the old audacity track uh god my greatest gift that's my greatest gift i would probably make

482
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:04,500
them french toast i'm pretty baller at that you make a nice french toast i would say probably

483
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,820
tender kisses anything special about them or just like that's all over

484
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:20,260
my greatest gift would be for me to film travis giving you the kisses because you want to you

485
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,180
want to remember it goes by so quickly i mean it takes 14 minutes but it seems like i would upload

486
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:33,780
them into iMovie i would use that one that looks like a map opening up and i would put some music

487
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,780
underneath it something real nice some five for fighting some superman by five for friends

488
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,420
that's what we need to kiss them for three minutes and five seconds which is the runtime

489
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,500
of superman by five for fighting and i'll tell you all someday why i know that information well

490
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:58,020
it's gonna work because when i kiss people um i do it like one might apply um uh glue stick

491
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:04,020
and i see their own body who does that i push on and then maintain the same pressure and then

492
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,700
just you maintain contact around like a slug it feels like a slug it's like that clean your

493
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:15,220
fish thing for you right remora remora i believe is what those are called you're a doctor fish is

494
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,660
what you're saying did you just point to your wife like tell them about the great kisses i give you

495
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:26,100
you want to come on stage and talk about my precious kisses five out of five would kiss again

496
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:34,900
yeah okay well can i uh can i get sidebar real quick super quick sidebar sure uh i know the bit

497
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,140
that we talked about was that we wouldn't see scanner santa when he came out to put the thing

498
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:46,500
in the booth oh okay listen listen i accidentally looked to the left because i was like where is he

499
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:53,540
and because i thought he wasn't out yet and i saw him and it scared the hell out of me

500
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:01,940
i you may have noticed a moment where i seem suddenly terrified for an instant imagine you're

501
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:09,140
just like doing your podcast here and then you adjust like pan left and there's a santa who's

502
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:14,020
just been there the whole time it was really really scary can i ask you a question i'm still

503
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,740
trying to get over it can i ask you a question hit me have you seen sydney since we started

uh and you're asking well is should i listen to what they say never no is that was that it because

bit just ben is fine ben yeah we're not getting married ben we're just doing a podcast

594
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,900
ben when you feel the wind rushing through your hair at 15 miles an hour

595
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,940
do you think when you're getting somewhere moderately faster than logging

596
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:53,780
when you see when you see a recovering grandma uh jogging past you do you think that their

597
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:59,700
their jives their jabs are gonna their japes are gonna penetrate your psyche they're not

598
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,460
you're gonna be thinking about one thing one thing only and that is freedom do you know

599
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:12,100
ben real talk if i may ignore everyone else who okay can i use the bathroom yeah here's the deal

600
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,620
ben what that is is you found a thing that makes you happy and that you enjoy and for whatever

601
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:24,260
reason there are people in your life that look at something that you to take unashamed happiness in

602
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:32,020
and they don't feel that and so they mock it and they won't accept the fact that you are

603
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:38,660
third like you are unironically unashamed of how much you love do you ironically ride the moped

604

607
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:11,620
serious um they're worried about you yeah he's too he's too real we lost him uh uh is it dangerous

608

609
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:24,660

610
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:29,940
too much and that becomes like your defining feature are you moped dude you're not wearing

611

moped attire i don't think you do have a hole in your jeans is that from a wicked accident

612
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,980

01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:57,220
the bit we were doing yeah so we're gonna christmas day we're gonna do some christmasy

654
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:03,220
stuff we don't have plans for christmas eve and another non-jewish friend of mine invited us to

no a jewish friend of mine non-christian i'm gonna take notes okay griffin your notes are

656
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,780

657
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:22,100
train robbery goblins sure why not please finish your question we are the rudest human beings on

658
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:29,140
the planet but it is my bim bam day so what's up so we don't have christmas eve plans we were

659
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:34,420
invited to like a sort of christmas orphan non like for the jews and muslims sure yeah

660
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:41,780
um the question is so he's got like a nostalgic attachment to christmas eve but we don't have

661
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:47,380
christmas eve family plans you don't have the trappings exactly okay so should we go to this

662
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,540
non-christmassy party for folks who aren't visiting their family or should we spend

663
01:06:53,540 --> 01:07:00,260
christmas eve just the two of us and our cats how many cats are they cool oh two yeah no they're

664
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:05,620
super cool okay well that's a horse of different color which is ironic because that was the line

665
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,820
that justin said is lord growly oh my god you're right wizard of oz anyway to answer the question

666
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:17,300
that the person directly in front of us just asked uh oof um man that's gonna be hard because

667
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:23,780
your your your boyfriend is gonna roll up like time to knit a stocking for everyone

668
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,540
because that's what i've done my whole time on this planet is your boyfriend here

669
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:35,220
yeah he's over there so hey hey uh here's what you guys have got and it's it's it's a really

670
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:42,500
great opportunity to now just do whatever you want and then let it shake out what becomes a

671
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:48,020
new tradition right you can really like wheat and chaff this and say like we're gonna do these ten

672
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:53,300
things i liked four of them we'll keep those four and the other six we don't have to deal with that's

673
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:57,780
a problem how many traditions do you think have been started by people doing something once and

674
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,500
they hated it but no one wanted to admit it to anybody else they've been doing it for 10 years

675
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,100
and then the next year they're like we need to sing in front of nana again right we gotta sing

676
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,580
in front of nana i guess are we gonna have time for our annual dear zachary they're going they're

677
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:17,380
not gonna sing in front of me again oh god they're so bad so bad i don't even want to sing with them

678
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:23,460
uh yeah i mean you guys can make your own traditions now and that's a very special

679
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:30,980
process but i totally get wanting to that was my leaking i'm about to disagree that's my noise

680
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,140
i'm about to disagree i think it's better to be with a bunch of people to be fun oh yeah yeah no

681
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,660
i'm not saying to be alone i'm saying make the traditions with other people boyfriend

682
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:47,540
and your official title boyfriend thing you craig craig you can enforce your traditions

683
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:54,420
because wow you're really putting craig on blast right now i love you but if you what did craig

684
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:02,180
do to deserve this listen here you jerk word and that's the best i could do but in all honestly

685
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:07,860
like if you try to recreate those traditions like you can do them but you can't expect

686
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:13,540
the same results as it was when you were i don't know i don't know what went travis transitioned

687
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:21,860
like guy at 2 a.m and you're both really drunk and he's like no no you listen to me sit down

688
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:30,820
it's my turn laid back in the bean bag it's mbnbm okay all i'm saying is that it's the

689
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,860
expectation game of you can roll up and do your tradition and relive that experience but it's with

690
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:40,980
a new set of people in new variables and it will be different and inherently the tradition will

691
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:45,860
alter because you have new people is the tradition could there be a tradition that you're maintaining

692
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:53,860
that's something awesome already like oh my whole life on christmas eve i get turnt i get turnt

693
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:59,220
let's go to a party it's like what do you do craig what's his name can you just tanner tanner

694
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:05,780

695
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:13,780
i get oh i get totally totally turnt and they're like yeah sure and then you all do it together

696
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:18,820
that's how traditions get born this year for thanksgiving i went and hung out we went i just

713
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,740
at decorating a christmas tree it's litter are you putting everything decoration up and it's

714
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,340
six inches away from the tree and they just drop it on the ground they're putting everything on

715
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,460
one branch it's like a beautiful christmas horn steve you just put them in your beard again aw

716
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:24,900
steve you ate the popcorn garland and then you just kept eating ornaments right off the tree

717
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:30,900
like some sort of giraffe also i want to say this i love that you said okay i'm bad at it i don't

718
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:38,340
like it so this year i hung out in the same room thumbs up and read a book thumbs down was the book

719
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:47,300
how to be good at basic human tasks like putting baubles on branches could you at least watch the

720
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:53,060
baubles being put on the branch say good job you see it you see it good job good good bubble

721
01:12:53,060 --> 01:13:00,180
placement nana here's the learning curve for baubles on branches once one time and you got

722
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:06,420
the logistics of it down you hung them on the wrong tree you went next door you broke into

723
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,540
the house next door and put it on their tree how are you so bad at this why are you a cat

724
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:16,420
that's been transformed into a human today you've knocked them all off that's the opposite of what

725
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:23,620
we wanted it's a pretty funny podcast i'm just watching it over here and it's pretty funny we

726
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,820
do a pretty good let me try one hold on could you crush up all ornaments and throw them in the chimney

727
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:37,780
the kid does this best i don't know what to tell you

728
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:45,460
justin did a great thing with his face uh but we need we need subtitles i really like the idea of

729
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,700
like a christmas tradition where it's all about um we're done talking about christmas tradition

730
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:54,180
so that was the last one we're on this idea of like we do it all together yeah it's a family
