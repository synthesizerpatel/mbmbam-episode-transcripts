1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,920
Hey, everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy. This is a genuine

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,280
MBMBAM prank. This is a genuine MBMBAM prank that you're listening to. Welcome to a MBMBAM

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
prank. It's our brother, Travis. It's not a fake prank. It's a genuine prank. And we're

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,520
pranking genuine. I wish we're pranking our brother, Travis, because he left the show to

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,720
go get pizza. So what's the prank? It's not much of a prank. Travis, we got you. We already started

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,160
the show without you. That was a MBMBAM prank. First of its kind. The amount of show that you

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,960
miss will be reflected in your monthly MBMBAM paycheck. You're going to be docked for those

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,520
minutes. You could have told several jokes in there. I wouldn't have though. Now that the prank

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,200
is over, let's go behind the scenes. Travis didn't actually leave to go get pizza. That was just like

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,160
a staging, very elaborate staging that we did because we wanted to introduce some new heat into

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,200
the show. And Justin thought that this would be a good idea. I think it's a bad idea. To be fair,

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
I didn't think it was a good idea. The producers thought it would be a good idea. I kind of went

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,080
along with them. And they were just getting that feedback from all the focus groups and stuff that

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,480
we did. Who were like, well, there needs to be more pranks on the show. Travis, confirm or deny.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,680
Are you going to be eating pizza while we record our smash hit comedy podcast? Is that the level?

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,760
Is that the level of respect to our readership for the written version of My Brother, My Brother

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,600
and Me that we released? The wildly unpopular written version of My Brother, My Brother. That

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,280
we released on the deep webs. I am just worried that if I wait till we're done recording, that's

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
an hour of cool off time for the pizza. And I think the people at home will understand that.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,720
Well, I got I got a question, Dillard. Why did you order pizza when you knew that the

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Chuckles were the Chuckles? Because I just got home. I mean, but like, it's not you knew that

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,560
this confluence of this pizza podcast crossover was was unavoidable. You knew it. You know,

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
Justin, I got to be honest with you. It didn't sneak up on me, but I was very short sighted.

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,520
I thought that the two would not coincide as deeply as they have. I didn't realize there would

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,840
be so much spillover into my professional life. So I feel like, you know, I have a lot to apologize

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,160
for. There's only one remedy, Travis. I'm going to take some time off to rebuild my relationship

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,120
with my family. I hope you respect my privacy in this trying time. And the trying time should last

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,160
about four and a half minutes. That's about how long it's going to take me to crush this.

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,840
Travis, I need you to stand up and throw that saw in the trash. I cannot do that.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,080
No, it's as a symbolic gesture to our readership to show that you still fucking after 200,000

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
episodes that you still fucking respect the hour. Travis, we're talking about 200,000

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,240
human hours that these people are pouring into the sieve of our podcast. And you are you are

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,080
aiming that sieve into a dumpster unless you symbolically stand up and throw that you're

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,280
eating the pizza right now, aren't you? No, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm throwing it into

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,880
the garbage like my family. That is also what you call your stomach, though. So I don't think

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,840
that that counts. I hate your pizza so much. I'm going to turn it into poop.

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Welcome to pizza break. Our new podcast where we talk about we order a za and then you listen

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,280
to us eat it for an hour. It is hot and delicious, too. This one is an

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,840
Asiago crust and I got it with like a white fresh fresh from Sicily chicken and it was well,

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,080
it was supposed to have spinach on it. They didn't do that from me. I didn't really want it.

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:27,360
The rolling verdant hills of Sicily. Travis had this fresh artisanal za coptered in.

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,280
Our listeners have spent one thousand eight hundred and twenty six years

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,160
listening to. Did you just map that out? Exaggeration cumulatively, nearly a millennia

49
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,000
of pleasure. Uh huh. Nearly two millennia. All leading up to this moment of pleasure.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
When I can eat pizza in their ears. Is that somebody's ASMR trigger? Oh, it's got to be.

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,800
God knows it's not mine, though. I hope it's not thin crust. It's my S.A.D. trigger because it makes

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
me very sad. All right, I'll take a break from pizza. I'll save it for the money zone.

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Uh, perfect. Sounds good. You always find that in anyway. So listen, this is as you've almost

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,080
certainly guessed, this is a comedy advice podcast where we that's Travis, by the way,

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,240
is our middle brother. We we take questions from you, the listening public and the readers

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,280
that we apparently have and we turn them out like into wisdom. So now let us let us away.

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Um, hold on. I got to let the cat in. Sorry. Don't prank me, though, while I'm gone.

58
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,920
This is a my brother, my brother, me prank. Prank day two. Griffin is left to go bring his cat in.

59
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,320
And now Travis and I are taking over the show. What are we going to do? How do these pranks work?

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I missed the first one. You put a whoopee cushion on his chair. OK, but he's but he's in Austin.

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,880
Call somebody. OK, get on Craigslist for Austin. Uh huh. Get on Austin Craigslist.

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,960
If anybody in Austin is listening to this show, go put a whoopee cushion on his chair.

63
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:04,400
I got I got him in on. Wait a minute. Wait, let me just sit down in my chair. Blart.

64
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,120
This is one of those special Paul Blart themed whoopee cush. Let's start this podcast. Over.

65
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,480
That would be the end. Welcome to my brother, my brother, me. Episode one in my neighborhood

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,880
outskirts of Pittsburgh. A lot of people own dogs but must not pick up after them because

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,600
there are turds everywhere. Once I even saw an owner let their dog drop a hot one

68
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,920
and then just continue on their way. I did not know what to say and I was scared of confronting

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,280
them. Is there a good way to confront someone if I catch them in the lack of act again?

70
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,760
That's from Dodging Doo Doo in Pittsburgh. I once saw somebody do that, like they their

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,760
dog just pooped in the middle of the sidewalk and they kept walking. Do you guys remember like

72
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,320
like, God, like a decade ago when every other time you left your house, you stepped in shit

73
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,760
like every like before before we came to our senses and we're like, we should we should really

74
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,720
be clean. It should like be a law or something that we just like, you know, handle it. And back

75
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,360
when we didn't handle it, literally 50 percent of the time you cross the threshold of your house.

76
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,560
So your first step out of the house was in shit because it was fucking it was Golgotha out there.

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,880
Was that the place? God knows that I'm awesome at biblical trivia. We've proven this time.

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
You've proven that going to all those biblical trivia nights at your local pub.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,120
That's true. But at the time you insisted that Abraham was the father of Cain and Abel.

80
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
I did my best. I did my best. I did my very best.

81
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,080
OK, so judging by Obama's recently released Midnight Amendments, this is definitely in

82
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,920
violation. Come on down. Oh, this is definitely this is anti. Come on. This is come off.

83
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,560
I would say this. I have to. I have to. This might be a triple. This might be a triple threat.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,840
I think it might. It might. It might be nice. And it's super not be cool. Yeah.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
I would say it's in violation of the first two. But I got to admit, if I saw that happening

86
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,200
and I was definitely not going to be in the path of the the poo poo, there might be a part of me

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,400
that was kind of like nice. I only feel that way when I see like a like a big old bulldog

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,640
taking a crap. And that's that's hilarious. You see a bulldog taking a crap. And then about

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,400
20 to 25 paces behind that, you see a big Wall Street broker and a big fancy suit walk. And

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,920
you're like, oh, this is going to be yummy. He's going to get it on his wingtips. Oh, yeah. Shitty

91
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,280
wingtips. Come on. But what you don't know is that he is a broker, but he invests his money

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,200
so that he can give more to the charities he supports. And he yells that he steps in shit.

93
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,240
How can this happen to me? I'm a charitable stockbroker, man. You're that one percentage

94
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,040
has stepped in 99 percent of that dog. Why not 100 percent? Because he's avoided a microbe of it

95
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,200
because he's got his wingtips. So it doesn't have toe space that normally would have crushed the

96
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,040
rest here. I OK, this is I completely get where the question asker is coming from,

97
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,520
because this is one of those like. You would be hypothetically within your rights to say, like,

98
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,280
hey, pick up your dog shit. But at the same time, it's like they they their only response to that

99
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,800
is going to be, hey, fuck you and keep walking. I mean, really, you can't be like I think that

100
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,640
you are perfectly within your rights if it's like if it's your lawn or or maybe a lot of

101
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,600
a charitable organization or something. My dog only shits in the Ronald McDonald House lawn.

102
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,440
I don't understand why it is a highly laxative effect that that clown has on him. I just you

103
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,160
can't go around being like Earth police like people are going to do that. And maybe you

104
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,280
you know, you yell at this person, you make them feel bad. They don't do it. They go around the

105
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,360
corner. They'll do it somewhere else. That's how these criminals operate. Because if you really

106
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,760
care, read a Malcolm Gladwell book. That's true. If you care deeply about it, you can always just

107
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,640
like carry some bags around with yourself and like when your dog finish shitting, you just like

108
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,480
stoop right down and pick it up. I'm looking at them like, no, I got it. And no problem about it.

109
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,440
No problem. No, you you have the fun part with the dog where you like play fetch and run around

110
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
with them. And I'll just pick up the shit for the dog that I have zero percent interest in.

111
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,680
It's just like Gandhi said, be the change that you want to see in the world. But

112
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
be like kind of shitty and passive aggressive about it. Exactly. While you do it. Travis,

113
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
could you follow him after you clear the first shit? Can you just follow him like bag wrapped

114
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,160
around your hand? Just waiting. I just want to be here in case just in case I got your back.

115
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm your support in this. We're going to do this together. We'll talk to you. Could we swing by

116
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Whole Foods? I'm sympathetic to the dog owner in this situation because 100 percent of the time

117
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,560
I leave the house to buy groceries, just like one or two things. I always forget my bag.

118
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,600
Austin has a plastic bag band. I don't know if that's popping off in L.A. and Huntington yet.

119
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,440
And I never have a bag. And I always have to buy a new bag. But you can't buy a shit bag when

120
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
you're walking your dog on the street and you forgot your shitty bag. And like, what do you do

121
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,400
in that situation? I'm not going to touch it with my hands because I'm a fucking human being trying

122
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,280
to just like live my life in the world. Can you still get plastic garbage bags? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

123
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah. For like, yeah, for your trash can. Sure. Can you just carry one of those around with you,

124
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,840
like some sort of deranged Santa Claus? Can you imagine if you saw like a tiny little

125
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,760
while finished shitting and the person pulled out like just a giant trash bag,

126
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,360
put it over like their whole body to pick it up and then tied it off and just carried it with you?

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,760
That's a fucking funny image right there, you guys. All right. Train another dog to pick up

128
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,160
that dog's poop. That's what if you got horrified by it and stamped on it as soon as it came out,

129
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,480
like you thought it was alive when your dog shits on a lawn, just cordon off the lawn with police

130
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,320
tape. Yeah. Nothing to see here. Move along a little chalk outline. Do you guys want to Yahoo?

131
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes. This Yahoo was sent in by level eight hundred and sixty two shaman,

132
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
Drew Davenport. And yes, he leveled up this week because he fucking crushed it this week.

133
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
Thank you, Drew Davenport. This might be an all Drew episode. Spoilers.

134
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Spy Yahoo answers user James, who asks, when a caterpillar is making a cocoon,

135
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,880
does it know it's going to become a butterfly or is it just like, what the fuck am I doing with my

136
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:44,080
life? Okay, wait, I'm confused by the question. What am I, what am I even doing right now?

137
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,720
Do they mean while it's making the cocoon, is it going, what the fuck is happening? Or do they

138
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
mean like the caterpillars going, I got nothing to do. I'm just going to stay inside my weird shell

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
thing. But see, that's the thing. It doesn't, it's never made a weird shell thing, right? They just

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
do that the one time, right? They can't switch between butterflies and caterpillars at will.

141
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,400
They're not fucking like lycanthropes. They, they, they just do it the one time. So they're

142
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,760
just like up in a tree. And then all of a sudden, like they, I imagine it is somewhat similar to

143
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,360
the first time that you discover ejaculate. And then that starts happening. And then all of a

144
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,560
sudden you're in it and you're like, wait a minute, what am I, what am I even doing right now? What is

145
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,200
this? It's all over me. It's got to be confusing as shit to be a caterpillar and be like, I was

146
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,120
supposed to hang out with Steve today. I went over to his place and there was just like a weird,

147
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,480
hangy shell thing. Yeah. I don't understand that. Wait, what am I doing with my butt right now?

148
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
What am I, what am I doing with my butt? What does this mean?

149
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:53,840
If you're a dad butterfly, you've got to be like, I don't know. It never happened to me.

150
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,600
Well, you must be like super sick or something. I've never seen.

151
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,560
We got to get to the bug. Or just say like, I'll see you in six years.

152
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
I've got to be in this thing for six years. Yeah. You'll probably die in there. Goodbye.

153
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,400
That shit's got to be crazy. Wouldn't it be great? Like just the very idea of that.

154
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,520
Like if, if human beings for the first like 30 years looked one way and then went to sleep for

155
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,680
like two years and they woke up and they were like birds and everybody was just like, yeah,

156
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,280
that's normal. That's just how it, that's what you do. We have the internet, right? Like the,

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,600
as soon as a silken thread emerges from the tip of my penis, I can very quickly be like, Siri,

158
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,560
what's coming out of my penis? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? She's like,

159
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,320
chill, chill, chill Griffin, chill, chill boss hog. Cause that's what I told Siri to call me.

160
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,760
Chill boss hog. It's going to be cool. You're cocooning and pretty soon you're going to come

161
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,800
out and this is what you're going to look like. And I'm going to go awesome. Caterpillars don't

162
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,080
got Siri. They don't. They just get up in a tree, silk and thread. And that's got to be so scary.

163
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Is it possible we're giving the caterpillars too much credit that maybe like it starts coming out

164
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,680
and they just go, okay, I'm down. Whatever. Fuck it. I guess this is my day now. Sure. Caterpillars

165
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,560
really the most easygoing insect. I'm apparently the Matthew McConaughey of bugs. Yeah, cool.

166
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,400
Whatever. All right. You know, yesterday I tried, uh, I tried an Oakley for the first time. Today

167
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,640
I'm going to be trapped in a weird thing that came out of my butt. Sure. Whatever. I listened,

168
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,720
I listened to fusion jazz for the first time. I tried Cuban food. I did. Very spicy, but I liked

169
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,000
it. I did not hate it. So I'm down for the adventure. You know what I mean? Let's just

170
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,080
see what happens. Do you think I've never seen like a butterfly come out of a cocoon? Actually,

171
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,280
you know what? I think I have seen a video of a butterfly coming out of a cocoon and they fly

172
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,720
away. How the fuck does that happen? Explain that to me science. Cause it's not like you,

173
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
you get wrapped up in a cocoon. Silk comes out of your butt. You're wrapped up in a cocoon. And

174
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
then when the silk is done coming out of your butt, a caterpillar book comes out of your butt

175
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,520
that says how to fly. You want it to be more like greatest American hero. Like without the manual,

176
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,960
they're just flying around, slamming into trees or just fall. They just fall. Don't you think

177
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,000
statistically there has to have like at least once that a caterpillar went into a cocoon

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,120
and then the cocoon opened up and he was still a caterpillar and he was like, ah, damn it must be

179
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,320
such a bummer when you're find out you're a butterfly, you're flying around. That's great.

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,720
And then you're like, so what do I eat now? It turns out still leaves. I'm almost certain it's

181
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,760
like, uh, like, uh, like a juice or some sort of the juice of the flower. They like pollen and

182
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,360
dung and tree sap and rotting fruit and human beings, other butterflies. We don't know anything

183
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,080
about bugs or anything. I guess even bugologists are like butterflies, man. They're crazy. They're

184
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,280
crazy. I bet there's an entomologist listened to our show. I like really excited and then really

185
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,640
sad. I've been waiting for this butterfly moment this whole time. I thought they were talking

186
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,080
about something I care about. They had that one episode where they talked about the Ashton Kutcher

187
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,480
film butterfly effect. And I thought that was going to be my moment, but very little of that

188
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,600
discussion was based on the physiology of butterflies. Here we go. Time to buck up. I'm dead

189
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,600
now. I have a new feature for the show. Okay. I have a new feature I'm bringing to the show.

190
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:34,480
This is a haunted doll watch. Justin texted us at two in the morning with this idea that he was so

191
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,680
psyched about. I was so psyched about haunted doll watch. This is my feature that everybody can hate.

192
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,560
Haunted doll watch live for eBay. Just to set this up for you guys. I have a little bit of information

193
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,240
about haunted dolls. This is from Miss Lady on eBay. In an article titled what to expect from

194
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,600
your haunted doll. Hello, this is Miss Lady. Yes, I am a collector of paranormal items,

195
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,960
dolls in particular. I guess a part of me buys the items for curiosity to see what will happen.

196
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,920
Also to hope that there would be some particular activity to convince non-believers in my household

197
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,960
that these things exist. For whatever the reason to buy these items, there are some things to

198
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,280
consider. I've purchased a few dolls and notice these items some things do occur. First, I used

199
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,520
to buy my eyes from individuals who would sell many other haunted items. For most of these,

200
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,640
I've noticed no paranormal activity. Well, yeah, because I have encountered exactly zero haunted

201
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
items in my lifetime. There aren't people that just naturally come across 300 that they sell

202
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,480
on bulk on Amazon Prime. Be wary of the seller who has hundreds of haunted items. Let's be real.

203
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
Who could actually acquire all these things? Fuck me. Does that really say that in the next sentence?

204
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,280
Literally, the fucking singularity has occurred.

205
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,560
I hate to say it. You could purchase a doll and the item wasn't really haunted,

206
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,920
just the item next to it was. So okay, you get a doll, right?

207
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,520
You think you have a haunted doll and it turns out that the desk it was on was haunted the whole time.

208
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:23,360
The house was haunted. I hate to say it. You purchase the item that is haunted and

209
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:31,600
the spirit eventually leaves. Yes, it's happened to me. Why does she hate to say it? I hate to say

210
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,360
it. Sometimes the spirit leaves. My whole life is so shitty that a ghost in a doll pops into my house

211
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,880
is like, what's your seat? What is your this place sucks. Bye. Oh, Justin, my favorite line in it.

212
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
I like antique dolls because there are more chances of it having actually acquired that

213
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,240
energy because it is so old. That's true. Because it's bumped up against so many ghosts, I guess.

214
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,040
A new doll, you go to the Build-A-Bear workshop. That is a 100% no haunting guarantee. I would say

215
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,840
if you don't want to get a haunted toy for your child, Build-A-Bear workshop is the only game in

216
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,440
town where you will get that 100% guarantee because you see the manufacturing process

217
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,000
from start to finish. There are no ghosts. You pick the color, you pick the felt, you pick the

218
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,360
stuffing, you stuff it. It does depend on whether you put a toy heart or a human heart in it.

219
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,560
No, don't do the second one. And the box that says haunted, do you want this one haunted? We

220
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,920
can shoot it with a ghost ray. You check no on that, and you know for sure. But old doll, who

221
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,400
knows? It's Jumanji, baby. Also, don't check the box that says, do you want this doll to become

222
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,960
life-size when you're not around and take your kid on adventures? Don't do it. It seems like a good

223
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,680
idea at first. Seems like fun, but no. They're going to teach them about drugs. Justin, I demand

224
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,640
you buy a haunted doll, and I demand that you start reviewing haunted dolls on YouTube. Haunted doll,

225
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,960
okay, I have one haunted doll to talk to you guys about this week. This week's haunted doll

226
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,040
and haunted doll watch is listed under haunted spirits doll caution on EMF meter paranormal

227
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,920
magic with companion. I'm looking at a picture of a doll with an EMF meter next to it that says

228
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,080
caution. Now it's not danger, this creepy porcelain doll, but it is caution on the EMF meter.

229
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,200
Of course, it measures spirit energy. There's a spirit inside, but it may not try to kill your

230
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,000
kids is what you're saying. Yeah, it may be cool. Just in the description here to talk about this

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,880
particular spirit doll, apparently this question asker is getting a lot of flack about having a

232
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,000
doll that was a caution on the EMF meter. And this particular haunted doll owner writes,

233
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,440
I've been asked about spirit dolls that are listed as danger. Madam Christine never, underlined,

234
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,480
adopted a spirit that was demonic. She would never expose her other spirit vessels to that.

235
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,720
She had a way of knowing if there were trouble and she would not bring them into her home.

236
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
All of the dolls, et cetera, that are sold by me are of the white light and they will never hurt

237
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,760
all of themselves. They get along with other spirit children. And if they are labeled danger

238
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
by Madam Christine's notes, that is because they were little troublemakers of some sort

239
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,440
or downright brats. Most spirit dolls are safe, but there are a few that were considered caution

240
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:29,280
or danger, but not dangerous. So these are like your super chill, like totally lax, like a haunted

241
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,080
doll. Not like your Chuckies. These aren't like serial killers. These are the ones that like,

242
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,360
maybe they just are going to like hang out with you and say like witty things, I guess.

243
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,760
Yes. As long as you're of the white light, this, this, this child is going to get along with you

244
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,520
just fine. And you could buy it now for $125 or make a bid at $55. You would be the first.

245
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,760
Okay.

246
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080
What scenario could there be a haunted doll that is not scary?

247
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
If my Admiral Ackbar action figure-

248
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,360
Only if he's haunted by Admiral Ackbar.

249
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,480
If my Admiral Ackbar action figure got haunted by anything, I would, I would find it amusing.

250
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
Not scary. I would actually love that.

251
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,400
You could buy a haunted clown doll right now.

252
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,880
I can.

253
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,600
No problem.

254
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,080
But I won't.

255
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,560
Buy a haunted clown doll right now for $29.

256
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,040
I don't use-

257
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
Looks like a sad clown.

258
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
That is a steal, by which I mean, they are stealing your money.

259
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay. One super quick, I'm almost done here. Last doll on Haunted Doll Watch this week.

260
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,680
Evil Possessed Haunted Demonic Clown Doll Vessel, $29. Buy it now.

261
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,720
12 people are watching it. They're keeping their finger

262
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,280
here on the paws and like, if this thing doesn't go above 50, I am taking it.

263
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
Evil, pure evil.

264
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,280
Let me act, let me act.

265
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,840
The spirit vessel used to be friendly with an Eeyore the Donkey like personality,

266
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,320
but one say something changed.

267
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,440
I believe a demonic entity killed or overpowered the old spirit or took it hostage

268
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,800
and now dominates the vessel.

269
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm too afraid to keep it in the house anymore.

270
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
The evil spirit told me his name is Ernie.

271
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm not convinced that it's his true name.

272
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:17,840
I have terrible nightmares of him coming at me with an ax.

273
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,280
It's all Ernie's doing.

274
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
So buy it.

275
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,440
Do you want this?

276
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,040
It's $29.

277
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,640
I'll take $30.

278
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
It is looking for a soul.

279
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,360
You can attempt to ask the spirit questions and desires

280
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,920
or wishes by writing a message and putting it in the cavity of the missing foot.

281
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
It will answer you.

282
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,240
Be aware.

283
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
It will want something in return.

284
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
What is going on?

285
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,320
And there are 12 people in the world that saw this and said,

286
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm going to keep an eye on this.

287
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,680
Yeah, can't let that one slip away.

288
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,600
Can't let this evil doll slip away.

289
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, Jesus, please.

290
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,960
That's been our hot dog.

291
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
And you can buy it now if you want to just skip.

292
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,320
Just buy it now.

293
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
You don't need to watch it.

294
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,160
Just buy it now.

295
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
Justin, you want to read a question now that you've spooked?

296
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm spooked out right now.

297
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,160
Don't be spooked.

298
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
My boyfriend doesn't eat cheese.

299
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
Not even on his pizza.

300
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
He is not lactose intolerant or allergic.

301
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
He just doesn't eat it.

302
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,720
Needless to say,

303
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,040
mealtime in our household can be quite difficult.

304
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,240
How do I get him in the embrace of the wonderful food that is cheese?

305
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
That's for cheese, please.

306
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
In Pittsburgh again, two Pittsburghians.

307
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,320
The one thing you don't say,

308
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
like, is it like,

309
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,800
I think the idea of cheese is gross or is it like,

310
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
I don't like the taste of cheese.

311
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,440
I don't like,

312
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,400
what is it that's driving this dude away from cheese?

313
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
I can sympathize here because I'm very,

314
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
for me, I'm very weird about cheese.

315
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,760
I don't eat uncooked cheese.

316
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,680
I can't eat raw cheese.

317
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
Wait, wait, wait.

318
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait, the fuck?

319
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,100
What?

320
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,760
You mean like,

321
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
non-melted cheese is the only,

322
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
cheese has two states,

323
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,040
melted and not melted, or milk.

324
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,520
That's what I mean.

325
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,080
Not cooked cheese is milk.

326
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,320
No, I mean, I can't cook unmelted,

327
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
I can't eat unmelted cheese.

328
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,560
What a weird hangup that you have, Justin.

329
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,600
It yaks me out.

330
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,880
It yaks me out, I like it melty and stringy and cheesy,

331
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
but when I bite into like,

332
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
when people eat cheese cubes like that,

333
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I just want to yarts all over it.

334
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
What goes through your head

335
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
when you see just like a slice of cheese on a plate?

336
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,720
I'd like to drink that.

337
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,160
That's what goes through his head.

338
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I want that, but more drinkable.

339
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,840
If only it was less al dente.

340
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Yeah, it's too al dente.

341
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,040
I don't know, it's just something about the texture

342
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,800
of unmelted cheese that just grosses me out.

343
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,240
I don't, I can't get down with it.

344
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
And if he feels that way about universal cheese,

345
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
I am sympathized.

346
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
I can't sit here and crochet.

347
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
Is it maybe something where Sidney needs to like,

348
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
hide some in like pieces of bread

349
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,000
until you get used to the idea of it?

350
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,480
Maybe put some in like applesauce for you?

351
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
Why is it so cold and not melted?

352
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,800
That's my thing about it.

353
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,080
Because it's cheese, Justin.

354
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
It's cheese, Justin.

355
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
This is what I'll say.

356
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
Maybe you just let your boyfriend listen to my plight.

357
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because I am like lactose intolerant.

358
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
I eat cheese and like, that's my night.

359
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,080
I plan my nights around like, I want to get my cheese on.

360
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
But that means I'm going to be sleeping.

361
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Definitely clear my schedule.

362
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
But I'm sleeping in the guest bedroom tonight.

363
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,600
I talked about this with my friends last night

364
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,880
and they laughed at me.

365
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,040
But I thought it was actually a pretty clever piece of,

366
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
just a real stroke of genius, a real master stroke.

367
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
Where if I do eat something like

368
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,160
my wife's delicious turkey chili

369
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,720
and like I know that I'm gonna have just farts all night,

370
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
then I'll sleep in the guest bedroom.

371
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,560
I'll just sleep in the guest bedroom

372
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,240
and that way I don't keep her up.

373
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,840
I don't have to worry about the things that I do.

374
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,560
It's like my little chamber of secrets.

375
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
When I accidentally,

376
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,560
I still try to keep that mystery alive

377
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,960
after some 10 years of being together.

378
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,360
When I accidentally toot in front of my wife,

379
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,840
I just kind of freeze like a wild animal

380
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
who's been caught in hell.

381
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Oh yeah, no, I get that.

382
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,160
And hope that she didn't notice

383
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,880
or more accurately isn't gonna draw attention to it.

384
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
That's what I do when my wife

385
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,440
accidentally sees me eating anything.

386
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
I stop mid bite until she looks away.

387
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
She must not know.

388
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
The information of what I look like when I eat

389
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,040
must be kept from her

390
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,360
because I want her to continue to love me and be attracted.

391
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,480
And you do it so quickly.

392
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, you really need like one of those high-speed cameras

393
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,760
to capture Travis actually eating anything.

394
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,720
Exactly.

395
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
What I'm saying though is that when I eat cheese,

396
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm making a tremendous personal sacrifice

397
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,520
to get that good, good cheese taste in my mouth.

398
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
And the fact that your boyfriend doesn't have my

399
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
dietary weakness

400
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,160
and still chooses to squander the gift

401
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,640
that God gave him of a normal stomach,

402
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,600
it makes me sick.

403
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,680
It makes me as sick as a healthy hunk of Gouda would.

404
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,720
You sicken me, sir.

405
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,160
One good way would be to like make a soup, you know?

406
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
Like a soup with some shredded cheese in it

407
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,160
and then mix it all up.

408
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,760
She's in it.

409
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Justin, I don't think that she just needs to trick him.

410
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,320
She needs to get him to take a bite of cheese

411
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,800
and then from that point on, he must always eat cheese.

412
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Yeah, I think that's a matter of like,

413
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,160
she wants to just eat cheese.

414
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,280
But maybe if you did it that way,

415
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
it's like you ease him into the cheese.

416
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,120
Like you just had secret cheese

417
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,720
and now maybe it's time for you to come out of the cold.

418
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
I will say there is something to that

419
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
because for a long time, Teresa wouldn't eat eggs.

420
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
So it's like, oh, eggs are disgusting.

421
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,440
I do not like eggs.

422
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,920
And then I just kept making them for breakfast,

423
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,240
like for myself, and eventually she was like running late.

424
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,800
She's like, okay, let me, you know, make me an egg.

425
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,320
And now like we eat eggs all the time.

426
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,280
Like she just kind of like became inoculated

427
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,960
to the things she did not like.

428
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,080
That was a really good story.

429
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
I like the part in the middle.

430
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
Where she started to like eggs again.

431
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,160
The rising action.

432
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,920
She says, no, it stops here.

433
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:40,320
Brothers, guess what's on my balls.

434
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,680
Travis, you first.

435
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
Guess what's on my balls.

436
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,080
Man, I hope it's underpants.

437
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,520
It's underpants.

438
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,960
Oh, what kind.

439
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
Griffin for three bonus points.

440
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,680
What's on my balls?

441
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,880
More like boners points.

442
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay, thank you, Travis.

443
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
You've been eliminated from the game.

444
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
Griffin, what's on my balls?

445
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,840
Can I be eliminated from the podcast?

446
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,720
Can I go be on a different podcast for a while?

447
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,960
Well, you're both out of time, unfortunately.

448
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
The answer was me undies.

449
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,360
I just need a break.

450
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,120
An official sponsor from my brother, my brother, me,

451
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
that is on my balls, but also my butt.

452
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
I need some space and I want you to respect

453
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
this space that I've requested.

454
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Like the space between your balls and butt

455
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
that me undies is also on.

456
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,760
Don't call me.

457
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,400
Me undies, I will call you when I tell you

458
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,920
that I'm ready to jump back in.

459
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
Me undies is the most comfortable underwear

460
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,880
you will ever wear.

461
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,840
I thought that was a lie until I started wearing them.

462
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
And now I can't wear anything else.

463
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
And I don't have enough pairs for that to be hygienic,

464
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,840
but I keep on keeping on because I'm a man of principle.

465
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
This is a grungy episode so far.

466
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
Grungy is the episode yet.

467
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,840
It's a little raunchy, I think.

468
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,280
They're really, really comfortable.

469
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,840
I, my wife Sydney just got, because they're advertising

470
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,240
on top of this as well, our medical history podcast.

471
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,280
She has tried the ladies underwear too.

472
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,320
She was crazy about them.

473
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,160
They're insanely comfortable.

474
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,000
They're environmentally friendly too.

475
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,080
They use sustainable materials from the Austrian Alps,

476
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,880
no less, which uses a CO2 neutral process

477
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,920
with a little carbon footprint.

478
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,640
They are a great deal too for the quality.

479
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,680
This kind of quality would normally cost you twice as much

480
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,920
as me undies, but there's no retail middleman.

481
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,480
They go directly from the underwear makers to your butt.

482
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
I've seen some people ask, is it, yes,

483
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,640
it's more expensive than a 90 pack of underpants

484
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
that you buy at like fucking Costco.

485
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
Yeah, it's gonna cost you more.

486
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,280
But listen, it's 2015, it's 2015,

487
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,240
and it's time for you to invest in the things

488
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
that really matter.

489
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Sometimes you think about something that's more expensive

490
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,120
and you don't see the increase, like the quality increase.

491
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,400
This you do, hands down.

492
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
I would pay twice as much as I would for me undies.

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
I literally, when my me undies are at the top

494
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,120
of the underwear stack, I get a little bit excited.

495
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
I get kind of peppy.

496
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm like, this is gonna be a good day.

497
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
I'm gonna be riding in style.

498
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,600
So you can get these even cheaper though

499
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,040
than they normally are.

500
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
Steal them from Justin.

501
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,360
Steal them from me.

502
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
Go to meundies.com slash my brother,

503
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,560
and you're gonna get 20% off your first order

504
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
and also free shipping.

505
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,280
Again, 20% off.

506
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
They're guaranteed you're gonna like them

507
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
or your first pair is free.

508
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,040
Put them on your butt.

509
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,000
Go to meundies.com slash my brother.

510
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
Guys, before we move on to the next sponsor,

511
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
will this be the time that we get

512
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,680
our first advertiser complaint?

513
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,200
Will this be, I feel like we keep pushing it

514
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,040
and we haven't hit that wall yet.

515
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,120
We've never had an advertiser.

516
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,040
I want you to know Justin, all I can picture

517
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,680
is as we're doing it, there's like a me undies executive

518
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,840
behind the glass in our recording booth,

519
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,920
and he's got like a cigar bit down in his teeth

520
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,280
and he's just thumbs up and shaking.

521
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,760
Thumbs up.

522
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,040
All right, put them on your balls.

523
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,760
Yeah, I love it.

524
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
The balls talk.

525
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
I love the balls.

526
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,880
Boys, boys, keep talking about your balls.

527
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
It's golden.

528
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,320
It's golden.

529
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,080
That's good radio, baby.

530
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,360
Ball stuff.

531
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,320
This is the bread we're proud to be associated with.

532
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
You're getting this, right?

533
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,240
You're getting this.

534
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,760
You're getting, you're rolling, right?

535
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,160
This is not just, you're not just checking

536
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,600
the test and the levels out, are you?

537
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,080
They're talking about their balls and you're missing it.

538
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Henry, you're missing it.

539
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,440
This is art.

540
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
You're leaving money on the table.

541
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
They're talking about their gooch.

542
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Oh, the ones that something about boners.

543
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,600
This is primo stuff.

544
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,360
He just gets his wallet out and starts throwing hundreds at us.

545
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,600
Can we turn this into an audio billboard?

546
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,320
Is that a thing?

547
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,920
Can we invent those for this moment?

548
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,800
It's just this man standing on a billboard yelling,

549
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,920
guys are talking about their gooch.

550
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,840
You're missing it.

551
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,400
Somebody get me an ice cream van without speakers.

552
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
I'm going to play this through the speakers

553
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,200
and drive around town.

554
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,160
This week, MeUndies is sponsored by my brother,

555
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
my brother and me.

556
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,840
You gotta listen to this podcast.

557
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
They're geniuses, these guys.

558
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
Did you get to the boner's bit?

559
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes, dad.

560
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
Yes, we listened to it.

561
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,880
Did you, but what he says, the boners?

562
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
Yeah, yeah.

563
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,120
Steven M. Undies.

564
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,720
Get in here and listen to this episode right now, dad.

565
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,820
Dad.

566
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,000
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

567
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,880
We have another spot and we're going to take this one.

568
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
We're going to be very serious about it

569
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,160
because you know why?

570
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,200
Cooking and eating is serious business

571
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,600
because if you do it wrong, you could,

572
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,000
you could burn your house down.

573
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
You could eat something yucky.

574
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,940
True.

575
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,760
If you fuck up this process,

576
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
you could be in dire straits, my friends.

577
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,760
But that is not going to happen

578
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,080
with our next sponsor, Blue Apron.

579
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,920
I'm going to just go off the reservation here,

580
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,280
tell you guys about Blue Apron

581
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,560
because I got a box of Blue Apron this week

582
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,600
and it came with three different meals.

583
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,920
This is a service where they're going to send

584
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,360
the components of three recipes in a box.

585
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,400
In addition to the actual recipe card

586
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
that tells you how to make the thing.

587
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,800
And it comes with everything you need to actually cook it.

588
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
It's all in the box.

589
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,360
The meat is refrigerated.

590
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,680
It's all like reasonably healthy stuff.

591
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
I got three meals this week.

592
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,440
I got a sort of a Mexican casserole,

593
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
a pistachio crested catfish

594
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,360
and a sort of chicken coconut milk stew.

595
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,840
Damn.

596
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,400
All three of which were absolutely delicious.

597
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,080
And it's like cooking,

598
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,640
but without all the really boring stuff.

599
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,440
And here's the thing,

600
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
like Teresa and I received the same stuff.

601
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
For $9.99 a meal, right?

602
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
You get these meals.

603
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,200
Like the Mexican casserole has lasted for like a week.

604
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,480
Like it's so much food for $9.99.

605
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,800
Like for that price, it's a ridiculous.

606
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,080
And it's all so good and like hearty and filling.

607
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,800
It's wonderful.

608
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,000
And relatively low calories.

609
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,280
So 500 to 700 calories per serving for like dinner.

610
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,240
That ain't bad.

611
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,360
And brought right to your door.

612
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
Like you don't have to,

613
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,600
you know when you want to make a meal

614
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,560
and you have to like hunt through the supermarket

615
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,080
to find all the different ingredients.

616
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,560
And like sometimes you just need like a teaspoon of salt

617
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,840
and you got to buy a whole thing.

618
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,600
Like, no, this takes out all of that shit.

619
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,880
Comes right to your door.

620
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
It's everything you need.

621
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm trying to eat healthier in the new year

622
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,600
and a big hiccup for that is ordering food or eating out.

623
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,240
Because you're always going to eat a lot more calories

624
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
than you think when you're eating out.

625
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
And this just takes off the hardest part,

626
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
which is when do I find time to go to the store

627
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,760
to buy the ingredients and everything.

628
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,120
This, it's all done for you.

629
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,160
You just get to do the fun part,

630
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,400
which is cooking it and also eating it.

631
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
And right now, if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother,

632
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,280
you'll get two free meals.

633
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
Like that's an amazing deal.

634
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,200
Like two free meals.

635
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,120
Why aren't you already doing this and checking it out?

636
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,720
Yeah, check it out.

637
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
Send us pictures of what you cook so I can get hungry

638
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
and eat it and come to your house and sell your food.

639
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

640
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

641
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,880
I have a message for Mr. Dan Bailey Yavondit.

642
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,640
You guys think I crossed that last name or?

643
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,200
Yes, I do.

644
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,400
I think you did.

645
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,040
Mr. Dan Bailey Yavondit or Yavondite?

646
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,120
Okay, second time wasn't as good.

647
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,600
And it's from Frankenkitty, who says,

648
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,040
Hey, DBY.

649
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
Thank you, Frankenkitty, for that kindness.

650
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,080
Hey, DBY.

651
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,960
Remember that time you and I repeatedly tripped

652
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
that feeble-minded blue dragon until it died?

653
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,280
It was like a D&D schoolboy.

654
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
Happy birthday.

655
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,000
All right.

656
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,120
Is this a drugs thing?

657
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
Is this a drugs thing?

658
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm tripping on that feeble-minded blue dragon.

659
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,480
That could be like a strain of kush.

660
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,880
Like they get pretty clever with those names.

661
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
Maybe it's like ropey vapor.

662
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,240
It's a ropey blue strain, and we're gonna call it

663
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,520
feeble-minded blue dragon.

664
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,960
Smoke it.

665
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,760
Happy birthday.

666
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
Smoke it, toke it, roll it up and poke it, baby.

667
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
Roll it up and what now?

668
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,000
Roll it up and poke it.

669
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,600
This is a primo strain.

670
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,320
Thank you very much.

671
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
Happy birthday, DBY.

672
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,240
Happy birthday.

673
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
This primo message is for Pat.

674
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
Did I use that correctly?

675
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,400
And it's from the primo Alex.

676
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah?

677
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,160
Are you making fun of me?

678
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,960
No, not at all.

679
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
Happy two-year anniversary to my ruggedly handsome,

680
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,320
super-duper strong, incredibly intelligent boyfriend, Pat.

681
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
You are the only person who makes me laugh

682
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,280
more than the macrobe does.

683
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
I don't like that.

684
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,360
What the fuck?

685
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,960
And that is how I know I love you.

686
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,280
I hope this embarrasses you just the right amount.

687
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,840
Love, Alex.

688
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,200
Not too much, not too little.

689
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,840
Just the right amount.

690
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,800
Just the right amount.

691
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,360
I feel-

692
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,240
Do you really have to get on our show

693
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,800
and throw around your money to insult us?

694
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,280
I would like to see Pat come here and talk about butts

695
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,600
and boners and taints and pizza.

696
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
Hey, Pat, why don't you come into our house

697
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,960
and talk that shit?

698
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,160
Pat, you bringing the heat?

699
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,200
Because we'll step.

700
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,840
We'll step.

701
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,640
We'll go outside and we'll make jokes at each other

702
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,080
until one of us falls down.

703
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,960
I hope the next episode has a sponsored message

704
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
where somebody just sends us a list of people

705
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
that they think are funnier than we are.

706
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,920
I hope the next episode is you guys and Pat and I'm out.

707
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
This message is from Jake

708
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
and it was sent in by David

709
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,400
and it says,

710
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
all the Wayans brothers.

711
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,880
That's it?

712
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,760
That's it.

713
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,480
They're the only-

714
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,280
That's it, all the Wayans brothers.

715
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
And fucking Pat, apparently.

716
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,920
Mr. Jerks on Pat.

717
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
If it's Pat and Oswald, then yes.

718
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,520
Yeah, that's fine.

719
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,840
Happy anniversary, Patrick Duffy.

720
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,640
Patrick Duffy.

721
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,080
There's a lot of Patricks funnier than us.

722
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,160
A lot of Patricks funnier than us.

723
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,120
Oh, well.

724
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,080
Win some, you lose some.

725
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
Happy anniversary, Alex and Pat.

726
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
Hey, this is Pop Rocket.

727
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,440
We're your source for all pop culture information.

728
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,760
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

729
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,960
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

730
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,320
No name calling, no rudeness,

731
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
just straight talk and a lot of role play.

732
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

733
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,480
Me too.

734
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

735
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

736
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

737
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,440
Yes, I guess.

738
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,000
I guess.

739
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
I do.

740
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:20,880
Sorry.

741
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

742
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,320
The best, the best, the best around.

743
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,800
Thank you, Drew.

744
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

745
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,760
They got suspended.

746
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
They did a bad word.

747
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,600
When they existed, when they lived.

748
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,080
And let's honor their memory by talking about their question

749
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,000
and answering it, providing them some relief.

750
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,800
They asked, poll, who is the sexiest green guy?

751
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Because I am bored.

752
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,760
Check this fucking dope answer out.

753
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
And this is their own answer.

754
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
Enzo Matrix from Reboot for me.

755
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,800
Size, hunky, you, open to men as well.

756
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,760
Well, yeah.

757
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,800
You can't, you can't.

758
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,840
All right, just try and fucking bar me from this conversation.

759
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,200
They have to mean the adult Enzo, right?

760
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Not like little kid.

761
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
This is Enzo when he goes off into the-

762
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,560
Oh yeah, when he gets lost in the internet and he comes back

763
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,840
and he looks fucking awesome.

764
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,800
He looks like Solid Snake, but green and fucking hunky as fuck.

765
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
The first person that getting lost in the internet

766
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
has ever helped, ever.

767
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,480
Yeah.

768
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,880
He got lost in the internet and got real fit.

769
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,680
I think he lost an eye though, which is like, yeah,

770
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,320
that'll happen.

771
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,080
I think he did.

772
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,120
And I'm really mad at myself because I could not remember

773
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,440
what the main dude in Reboot was named.

774
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,840
I think his name was Jeff Reboot.

775
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,320
Jeff Reboot.

776
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,880
Jeff Reboot.

777
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,120
Jeff Reboot.

778
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,880
Well, time for a Google break.

779
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,640
Bob.

780
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,040
Bob.

781
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,560
Bob, of course.

782
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,120
Bob.

783
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,040
That's a fucking good answer.

784
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,960
It is very rare that Game Recognized Game on Yahoo answers.

785
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,000
By Game Recognized, God, I wish I knew this person's name.

786
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
I wish they had not been suspended.

787
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,920
What about Roger Klotz?

788
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,320
That's pretty good.

789
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,600
He's a bad boy, but you could tell he had a good heart.

790
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,200
And a fucking smoking body.

791
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,360
In the later years, there was like a Doug, the new class,

792
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,440
but it was the same class.

793
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,160
They were just older, so kind of a dumb name for the show.

794
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,440
But Klotz is looking good.

795
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,680
He was doing lots of fucking reps at the gym

796
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,600
and his body looked really good.

797
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:25,840
Yeah.

798
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,640
I'm trying to think of other green people.

799
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,040
Trek.

800
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,400
I know he's not everybody's style,

801
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,560
but he's really funny.

802
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,240
He's made me laugh a lot harder than...

803
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,280
Put him on the list above, I think, even the way...

804
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
Not a top-notch butt.

805
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,800
No, the butt's not great.

806
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,120
It's just because it's not rendered especially well.

807
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,800
Great work, dream works.

808
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
But I will say that the stink would be bad

809
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
because he's a swamp monster.

810
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,280
Is the Jolly Green Giant out?

811
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,000
Maybe if you're into Vore, it's a pretty sweet way to go.

812
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,840
What are you fucking talking about?

813
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,560
Start over.

814
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,240
The Jolly Green Giant.

815
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,040
I got that part.

816
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,080
I heard the name, Travis.

817
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,000
Is he out?

818
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,360
How does he Vore anybody?

819
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,160
He doesn't walk around fucking-

820
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,200
Because he's giant.

821
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,600
He's giant and he eats people for eating his children.

822
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,120
You understand-

823
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,000
Ho, ho, ho.

824
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
You ate my children, now I'll eat you.

825
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,640
That's not what he does.

826
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
I think I remember that commercial, Griffin.

827
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,000
Also, if you knew anything about Vore,

828
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,800
if you ever fucking...

829
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,360
I listen...

830
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,040
Oh God, I listen to Bunker Buddies all the time.

831
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,280
You've never listened to a single fucking episode of BigGolf,

832
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,760
or else you'd understand-

833
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,720
I can't find it.

834
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,760
Or else you'd understand...

835
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,560
I've sent you the fucking deep web links.

836
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,680
You would understand that when a giant swallows something,

837
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,720
like a giant, giant...

838
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,280
Like Gulliver's Travels swallows a person,

839
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,880
it's not good Vore because you don't get squished down in there.

840
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
It needs to be a little bit bigger than a human swallowing a human,

841
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,200
and they get bulked up and you can see the fucking impressions

842
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,640
of their body inside the body.

843
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,280
You don't know fucking anything.

844
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,560
I don't wanna talk about Vore anymore.

845
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,560
Repeat the question.

846
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,040
Let's start...

847
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,840
Let's take it back to the beginning

848
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,960
because I want a concrete answer.

849
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,400
Poll, who's the sexiest green guy?

850
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,240
Are there answers?

851
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,880
Are there any answers?

852
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,240
Yeah, the Jolly Green Giant is on here,

853
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,440
but apparently you struck him from the list

854
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,000
because he walks around fucking murdering people by swallowing them

855
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,600
and dissolving them in his giant green stomach acid.

856
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,400
He's too big.

857
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,120
I can't imagine making love to him for he is far too large.

858
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,200
Can I hit you guys with this?

859
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,400
How does Gumby grab you?

860
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,720
Gumby's...

861
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,780
Yeah.

862
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,000
Because you can do whatever you want.

863
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,500
Yeah.

864
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:29,760
Yeah.

865
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,160
I like that.

866
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,200
That's a solid answer.

867
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,560
I put him in top five.

868
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,040
His body's not like great.

869
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,840
He's a little bit better than Shrek, I guess,

870
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,320
but you could mold some six pack onto him.

871
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,880
That's what I'm saying.

872
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,240
Or just carve it in.

873
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
He's just like rubber.

874
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,920
I don't think he'd love that.

875
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,160
The Incredible Hulk is on this.

876
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,440
He's got anger issues.

877
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,880
He doesn't have a good personality.

878
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,760
Are we talking about like,

879
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,640
who do you wanna just like make love to

880
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,640
or like who could you see yourself with?

881
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,520
It's sexiest.

882
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,760
So I think it's just like an erotic thing.

883
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,080
Okay.

884
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,280
Then I'll give you a Hulk,

885
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,880
especially like newer Hulk.

886
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,240
That old Hulk had a very like square face.

887
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,440
I wasn't into that.

888
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,280
Eric Bana,

889
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,640
Ruffalo Buffalo,

890
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,960
or Ed Norton.

891
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,360
It's Ruffalo Buffalo.

892
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,200
See, I'd go Bixbo.

893
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,160
He's got that rugged 1970s sexuality

894
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,440
that really works for me.

895
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
Well, that's a good point.

896
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,160
Or Farigna.

897
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,240
Yeah, Farigna.

898
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,520
You could fucking bounce a dime off Farigna.

899
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,640
God damn.

900
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,520
Any part of him.

901
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,640
He does not like it,

902
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,280
but you can do it.

903
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,040
Quit throwing dimes at Lou Farigna.

904
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,840
Confuses him.

905
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,200
I bet that the Grinch post-conversion

906
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,360
would be a very giving lover.

907
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,120
Oh, he's got so much to give, you know?

908
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,800
And he's a little bit shy

909
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,400
because he's never really done this before.

910
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
Listen, his heart wasn't the only thing

911
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,680
that grew three sides.

912
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,440
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

913
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,880
Also, his hoopiness.

914
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,600
I'm not even trying.

915
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,160
That was funny.

916
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,280
Let's just say I've got a 39 and a half foot pole

917
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,320
that I would touch him with.

918
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,600
This is a dumb podcast.

919
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,960
One of these motherfuckers

920
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
said Captain Planet.

921
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,720
Stop, stop.

922
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,480
He's blue, you dumb idiot.

923
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,120
He's kind of like an aquamarine.

924
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,400
He's like a teal.

925
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah, maybe if you had like a busted

926
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,200
old shitty television

927
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,040
that couldn't get colors right, idiot.

928
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,800
Are there any green women?

929
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,240
All these are dudes.

930
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,920
Oh, the green M&M.

931
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,760
Ding dong.

932
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,920
The bit is dead.

933
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,280
What times are acceptable for text messaging

934
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
a friend or family member?

935
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,440
This is a good question.

936
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,080
Yeah, it is.

937
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,640
I would say it's an important question

938
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,560
for this trio of people.

939
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,600
I wouldn't think of calling someone

940
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,880
during traditional sleepy hours.

941
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,640
I find myself sending text messages

942
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,080
regardless of the time of day or night.

943
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,360
No one complains,

944
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,120
but wonder if I should restrict my texting

945
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,000
in the same hours.

946
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,080
I restrict my non-emergency phone calls.

947
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
That's from Terrible Textor in...

948
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,200
That's Minnesota, you stupid dummy.

949
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,040
Okay, let me start off by asking this.

950
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,240
What are the approved hours for phone calls?

951
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,920
Is it like nine to nine?

952
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,680
Okay, so I think if you don't know the person

953
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,360
before nine o'clock is okay.

954
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,280
I think if it's a family member

955
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,120
before 11 o'clock is okay.

956
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,880
What do you mean PM?

957
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,520
This is my fault.

958
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,640
This is my fault.

959
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,640
My anger issues towards the two of you,

960
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,920
mostly Justin because Travis,

961
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,280
you're way behind us now.

962
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,320
I'm in bed at 10.30.

963
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,840
I'm in bed at 10.30

964
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,200
because I need nine hours to be trying to sleep

965
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,720
because I can usually only squeeze

966
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,480
about eight good ones out of it.

967
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,520
Out of a nine hour block,

968
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,080
I usually lose an hour to tossing and turning

969
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,440
and pee breaks.

970
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,280
I'm trying to remember words to songs.

971
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,520
Yep.

972
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,480
That's what always gets me.

973
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,760
Justin, when you text me after 11

974
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,880
to tell me that you're really into haunted dolls now.

975
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,920
But Griffin, that couldn't wait till morning.

976
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,760
That's information you need to know now

977
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,680
in order to complete your night sleep.

978
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,440
I would have sent it to you another time,

979
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,880
but I was drunk then.

980
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,680
Wait, so Griffin,

981
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,280
do you not silence your cell phone

982
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,880
when you go to bed?

983
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,280
Travis, that wakes me up.

984
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,880
Okay, hold on one second.

985
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,120
I sent that text to you at 12.05 local

986
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,640
on a Saturday,

987
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,080
which is 11.05 p.m. on a Saturday night for you.

988
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,520
How old are you?

989
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,000
Seriously.

990
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,200
I'm 27 years old.

991
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,840
That doesn't change what my fucking body wants

992
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,040
and what my body needs,

993
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,560
which is nine hours of sleep to get-

994
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,840
11 o'clock on a Saturday?

995
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,680
I had also been drinking all day,

996
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,800
especially hard after my goddamn Packers shit the bed.

997
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,360
Put two good turds right there in the bed.

998
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,320
Good work, Packers.

999
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,680
Good work, Bostick.

1000
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,040
Great job, Packers.

1001
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,560
Packers Super Bowl-

1002
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,920
Is that on Saturday?

1003
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,960
No, it was Sunday, wasn't it?

1004
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,640
What was I doing Saturday?

1005
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,400
Apparently going to bed before fucking the news,

1006
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,360
like a pep hall.

1007
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,960
I wake up at seven in the morning,

1008
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,320
regardless of what day it is,

1009
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,360
and I start working

1010
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,760
because I'm on that Malcolm Gladwell outlier shit.

1011
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,360
I'm trying to get 10,000 hours in

1012
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,840
of a few activities before I shuffle off this mortal coil,

1013
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,200
and in order to do that, I get a jumpstart

1014
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,480
because that's when my brain is fucking firing,

1015
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,600
firing on all cylinders.

1016
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,880
You text me at 11 o'clock,

1017
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,560
my next day is all about that text.

1018
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,480
You also didn't respond to the text until like 1.50 the next day.

1019
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,080
Yeah, because I was unconscious.

1020
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
He needed to take in the information

1021
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,880
and really mull it over before texting back.

1022
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,800
I needed to stop hating you,

1023
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
and it took me 13 hours to get there.

1024
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,080
Okay, fine.

1025
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,120
So I will also say that Travis is the worst.

1026
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,800
Well, I'm three hours behind you guys,

1027
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,920
and I'm still getting used to the fact

1028
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,160
that if I text you at nine, it's midnight your time.

1029
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,200
Yeah.

1030
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,880
But you get incensed when we text you

1031
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,560
when it's seven o'clock your time.

1032
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
Well, because that's my time.

1033
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,440
You know what I mean?

1034
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,360
That affects me negatively,

1035
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,360
not the other way around.

1036
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,520
Dad is also very bad.

1037
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,040
Dad, of all the three of us,

1038
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,240
Dad doesn't give a fuck.

1039
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,600
Dad will text you at four o'clock in the morning

1040
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,280
to ask you if you remember who that guy was

1041
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,720
on that one episode of Doctor Who.

1042
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,680
I can be on stage on inauguration day

1043
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
being sworn in as president,

1044
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,480
and Dad's like,

1045
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,120
hey, yo, what's up?

1046
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,240
You watch Arrow?

1047
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,200
Like, no, I don't.

1048
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,880
I never watched Arrow.

1049
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,960
He at least, he's gotten better

1050
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,240
because he used to just text like,

1051
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,600
call me ASAP.

1052
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,720
And then you'd call him and go,

1053
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,760
what was that movie?

1054
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,160
What happened?

1055
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,640
Who's dead?

1056
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,920
Yo, did you watch Arrow?

1057
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,120
He at least not just text the question.

1058
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,560
Arrow last night was sick.

1059
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,200
Our dad has done morning shifts in radio

1060
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
for like three decades.

1061
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,320
So he always wakes up at about 4, 4.30.

1062
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,720
So by like 6.30 AM,

1063
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,320
Dad's day is in full swing.

1064
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,880
And for Travis,

1065
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,960
that's 3.30 in the fucking morning.

1066
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,280
For me, it is still 6.30,

1067
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,720
which is still crazy.

1068
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,280
Just like-

1069
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,080
I look forward to the day

1070
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,720
when the text message just appears in my dream

1071
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,280
and it's just like,

1072
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,040
we have to get away from these zombies.

1073
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,720
Also, who was that guy in Doctor Who?

1074
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,440
Ask your dad.

1075
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,040
Just, I just play it safe.

1076
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,840
After 10 AM Pacific time.

1077
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,480
So after 1 PM Eastern time

1078
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,560
to like 9.30 PM Eastern time.

1079
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,600
Those are the texting hours.

1080
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,640
You get eight and a half hours

1081
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,600
to get your texts off.

1082
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,120
So make them fucking count.

1083
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,840
Cause afterwards it's dead.

1084
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,240
If anybody listening can make iPhone

1085
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,200
or make apps,

1086
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,360
make an app that automatically

1087
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,160
you set the time when it starts and stops.

1088
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,800
It just like holds all incoming texts

1089
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,120
messages and phone calls until it ends.

1090
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,160
I think they have that.

1091
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,400
You're welcome.

1092
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,600
I think they have that though.

1093
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,480
I think they have do not disturb times,

1094
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,600
but it only passes through

1095
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,080
if they like text 911 or something like that.

1096
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,720
But I'll still get a 911 text about Arrow.

1097
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:20,640
You've been listening to our comedy advice podcast.

1098
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,080
We're brother, my brother and me.

1099
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,000
We hope you've had a lot of fun here today.

1100
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,880
I hope you learned something.

1101
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,560
I hope you grew as a person.

1102
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,680
A few little housekeeping things.

1103
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,200
We put our live shows on sale on Friday,

1104
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,840
I guess, right?

1105
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,480
Friday at noon, central standard time.

1106
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,400
They sold out.

1107
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
Two of the shows were sold out.

1108
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,240
Our Chicago show has sold out.

1109
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,600
It sold out about six minutes.

1110
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,120
So don't feel bad if you didn't get tickets.

1111
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,440
We are trying to figure out a way

1112
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
to like get some more tickets available

1113
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,280
because we know there's a lot of people

1114
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,640
in Chicago that want to come.

1115
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,560
So we're trying to do something

1116
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,800
to alleviate that problem for you.

1117
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,440
But you should keep it tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook.

1118
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,600
If we do come up with some sort of solution for this issue,

1119
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,160
we try to give you as much heads up as possible.

1120
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,920
We're being broad because we don't know what it is yet.

1121
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,480
If we had something to announce, I swear we would.

1122
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,320
It sucks.

1123
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,480
Like we're going to figure something out.

1124
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,400
It's just we don't know what it is yet.

1125
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,520
So please stay tuned.

1126
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,680
And I'll say this, if we do something,

1127
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
figure something out before we record again,

1128
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,600
before we can announce it on the show,

1129
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,680
if you bought tickets to one of the shows

1130
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,520
and we managed to get extra tickets on sale in Chicago,

1131
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,440
please, if you already have tickets to another show,

1132
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,080
please don't buy them.

1133
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,280
I know that's shitty to ask you

1134
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,440
not to support us or whatever.

1135
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,320
But the idea of us doing shows this year

1136
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,760
and trying to do a bunch of live shows

1137
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
all across the country this year

1138
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,240
is that we want to get out

1139
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,480
and see people that we haven't seen before

1140
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,920
or that we haven't seen since 2008 or something.

1141
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,000
So please, that was before we did the podcast,

1142
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,880
but you know what I mean?

1143
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,120
Please just stick to the one, I think.

1144
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,280
That's Griffin's perspective.

1145
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,120
My perspective is I don't give a shit, man.

1146
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,280
Emily still spends a lot of money.

1147
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,120
We do want to say thank you to everyone in Chicago.

1148
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,840
That's a ridiculous amount of support.

1149
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,680
That's fucking insane, yeah.

1150
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,040
And seeing everybody go,

1151
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,520
please, I must see the show, do something.

1152
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
We are listening and we are trying.

1153
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,600
We're trying.

1154
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,800
We're trying to do something.

1155
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,600
Listen to the other Max Fun shows.

1156
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,800
We each, I mean, we have some extra ones

1157
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,160
if you like to listen to our dumb voices.

1158
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Travis has Bunker Buddies, like he does with Andy.

1159
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,560
Justin has Sawbones, like he does with Sydney.

1160
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,720
We all do The Adventure Zone with our dad.

1161
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,560
Episode five for that dropped last week.

1162
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,200
Did we tweet, by the way,

1163
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,560
that this episode was gonna be a day late

1164
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,520
because of the holiday?

1165
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,560
I think they'll figure it out.

1166
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,760
Yeah, I hope so.

1167
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,960
When it comes up.

1168
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,240
No one's complained about it yet,

1169
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,880
so I'm thinking that they must realize

1170
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,560
that with being on holiday here in the US.

1171
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,920
Okay, well, there's a lot of really good

1172
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,280
Max Fun shows to go listen to.

1173
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,800
There's a new one, Pop Rocket.

1174
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,320
It's a show about all things pop cultural.

1175
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,800
You can find that on Maximum Fun.

1176
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,360
It's really funny.

1177
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,360
I listened to the pilot episode last week.

1178
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,480
Yeah, it's really good.

1179
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,720
I also, I did a guest spot on a non-Max Fun podcast

1180
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,120
called The K.O. with Kurt Braunohler, K-O-H-L-E.

1181
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,080
It's on The Nerdist.

1182
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,320
And it's a multi-format podcast

1183
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,400
where sometimes they talk about their pets

1184
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,640
and sometimes they talk about boats.

1185
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,680
But on this episode, it was a format called Get Lost

1186
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,080
where he blindfolded me and drove me through LA

1187
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,920
and took me to a really cool location

1188
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,840
and interviewed me on the way there.

1189
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,160
It's coming out the same day that this comes out,

1190
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,040
so go check that out.

1191
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,960
I'll post a link to it on Twitter

1192
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,000
and in the Facebook group.

1193
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,760
You listened to that show and researched shit

1194
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,000
before you agreed to get kidnapped, right?

1195
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,400
Correct.

1196
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,640
I actually am a really huge fan of the show

1197
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,840
and I was really happy to be on it.

1198
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,160
So if you're looking for a show to listen to,

1199
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,160
The K.O. it's really great.

1200
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,640
Is that it?

1201
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,760
Send in some questions, please,

1202
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,440
for the live shows that we're doing

1203
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,640
in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

1204
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,400
If you're gonna be at either of those shows,

1205
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,360
we're doing LA February 6th

1206
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,040
and San Francisco February 7th.

1207
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,560
I think they might be both sold out.

1208
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,640
Are there still tickets available for Sketch Fest?

1209
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,840
No, they're both sold out.

1210
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,040
They're both sold out.

1211
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,280
Sorry, guys.

1212
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
This is the first time we'll ever do

1213
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,040
like back-to-back days of shows, really.

1214
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,360
So we need a bunch of questions.

1215
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,440
So just send us all the good questions you can.

1216
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,920
If you're going to the LA show,

1217
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,680
we kind of have to do a change of plans.

1218
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,720
Justin, you wanna talk about it?

1219
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:31,760
Yeah.

1220
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,840
So we were supposed to have Sawbones opening that show

1221
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,120
and Sawbones is of course me and my wife, Sydney,

1222
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,800
but is also in some ways my baby

1223
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,400
who we did a little bit of traveling

1224
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,600
during the Christmas holidays

1225
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,360
and she did not do so hot with it.

1226
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,280
But apparently babies are really into routine and stuff.

1227
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,160
So as a result, we're gonna have to,

1228
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,160
Sawbones is gonna have to bow out of the shows in LA,

1229
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,120
or the show in LA.

1230
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,200
So that is, that bums us out heavily

1231
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,640
and we are very sorry, but...

1232
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,360
That doesn't mean you're gonna get less podcasts.

1233
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,840
Let's see, how can we be vague about this?

1234
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,600
There will be two podcasts there.

1235
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
Mabim Bam will be one of them.

1236
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,960
The other podcast, special guest surprise podcast.

1237
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,560
Premier, a world premiere episode.

1238
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,960
Well, a live show premiere of a special guest podcast

1239
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,440
that you will only get to catch if you're in LA.

1240
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,200
Yes.

1241
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,640
So we're very excited to be partnering up with them.

1242
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,200
I think it's a relationship that we've been building

1243
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,760
for a long time and I think you're-

1244
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,040
And we're sorry about Sawbones.

1245
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,320
I know that's hard to swallow,

1246
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,560
but I think that this new addition is gonna be great too.

1247
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,360
Yeah.

1248
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,120
We also wanna say thanks again to MeUndies

1249
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,640

It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1263
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,800
They won't send you free food or cheap undies,

1264
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,960
but they will give you good, good tunes.

1265
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,840

One more question.

1282
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,520
Yeah, I thought we'd just like do the thing

1283
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,280
that we've done 234 times already.

1284
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,600
Okay.

1285
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,440
This final Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1286
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,160
Thank you, Drew.

1287
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,200
All Drew episode.

1288
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,000
Been a while.

1289

Thank you, Drew.

1290
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Brie Bella and Nick

1291
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,480
who asks a shared account.

1292
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,240
They can't be trusted individually

1293
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,720
with the responsibility of handling their own accounts.

1294
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,080
There's a dual account.

1295
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,600
Brie and Nick ask

1296
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,720
question about the TV show Small Wonder.

1297
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,000
Was Vicky a doll with someone doing her voice

1298
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,520
or was she a real human?

1299
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,880
I'm Justin McRoy.

1300
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,080
I'm Travis McRoy.

1301
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,760
She was a haunted doll.

1302
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,640
Haunted doll watch.

1303
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,600
It's the best new bit.

1304
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,720
All my brother and my brother and me

1305
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,600

1306
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,480
I'm Griffin McRoy.

1307
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,720
It's been a little bit of weather.

1308
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,160
My brother and me kiss your dad.

1309
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Sway on the lips.

Hello, buddies.

01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,840

And we're the host of Bunker Buddies.

1317

We're a podcast where we're amateur survivalists

1318
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,600
and we talk about things like the apocalypse.

1319
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,080
And we talk about zombies and preparedness.

1320
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,400
What are you gonna wear when it's the apocalypse?

1321
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
And you have no idea if you don't listen to our show.

1322
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,880
It comes out every Wednesdays on Maximumfun.org

1323
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,840
and on iTunes.

1324
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,440
Sometimes we try weird foods

1325
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,960
or we talk about where to camp

1326
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,560
or how to avoid getting eaten

1327
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,840
or any of these things.

1328
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,800
Yeah, so listen to us

1329
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,720
because it might just save your life.

1330
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,160
We'll see you in the bunker.

1331
01:01:44,160 --> 01:02:10,160
Bye.
