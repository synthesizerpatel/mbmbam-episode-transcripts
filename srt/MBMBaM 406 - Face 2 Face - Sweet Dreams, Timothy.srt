1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,440
Welcome, my brother, my brother. Be an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
What the fuck are you doing? You just have like one knee on your leg and standing,

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
sitting, lying down. Sit down or sit down. Okay. Welcome, my brother, my brother. Be an

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,040
And I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:24,960
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,080
You know, yeah. Justin. Travis. I've always said Columbus is the horniest city,

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:46,880
and now it's proven to be true. You can keep your New Orleans. You can keep your Las Vegas

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,720
side. Wow, two whole cities just for me? I'll take horny Columbus, as I thought.

15
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,720
Horny Columbo. Horny Columbo, by the way, would be a good remake of Columbo. Okay.

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay. Just one more question. Is it on? One more question. You feeling this?

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,320
Speaking of a pleasant person in the sound booth, if you could turn the monitor from wherever it's

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:26,320
at now up to horny so I can hear the talking, that would be excellent. My dad did a great thing

19
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,200
talking about sports, which I love. And understood all of it. And then he did this great thing where

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,840
he spelled half of Ohio. And in my head, all I could think was, I wonder what other words these

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,840
guys know how to spell. Well, you know what's round on the end and high in the middle? Ohio.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,400
Yeah. It's great. Y'all do riddles too. Cool. Okay. All right. What can't you see and can't

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,160
you touch, but if you put it in a barrel, it makes the barrel lighter. Wow. You're wrong.

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,160
Negative water. You stupid. I've actually had some that I've been trying to crack that I'm

25
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:11,440
going to pitch to you guys. I got a junior jumble at home. We are all full of hot, wild Ohio energy.

26
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,080
We are also very excited because today is the day of the Kentucky Derby.

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,920
I love the weird Venn diagram of our podcast of like people who want to go see my brother,

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,200
my brother and me, but also at the mere mention of horses.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,440
I kid you not. Dad was backstage like an amateur bookie, literally asking us like,

30
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,240
you want to play some bets? I have a website where I can play some bets.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I don't think, I mean, he took money from someone and placed a bet for them. He is no longer about

32
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,560
the juice. He's no longer an amateur. He is in the pro space. He is a bookie now. Paul,

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
I changed my mind. I hate the hook. It's making my microphone come off. Please come fix it, Paul.

34
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
No, don't you touch it. I don't fucking trust you.

35
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's just lose the hook. It's our first tour with the headset mics. We're still figuring shit out.

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,200
Paulandstorm.com. Get off, buy all Paul's music.

37
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,040
We only buy Paul and Storm on MySpace. We only pay Paul in mentions, so please

38
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
make this deal pay off. Okay, here's the name of some horses.

39
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,600
43 to one, a long shot. Free drop, Billy. Fuck yeah. Wait, hold on. What do you think the three

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,640
different drops are? Free, free. F-R-E-E free drop. I thought it said like drop one. He dropped

41
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,760
some knowledge on you. Drop two. The bass. I know very little about- Drop three. You drop to the

42
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,080
ground because you're so impressed by both this knowledge and the bass. I know very little about

43
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
horses despite the fact that they are a rich comedy vein for us for reasons beyond my understanding.

44
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't think you want your horse to drop in any way, especially unrestrained to the ground.

45
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,560
Promises fulfilled. I like this one. That's good. But you better like, if you say like,

46
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,920
oh hey there Derek, I'm gonna win the big race today, but you fucking better now. Yeah,

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,800
that's a promise. We got Flame Away. We got Audible. Glad that they're branching out.

48
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:38,160
We got MeUndies. We got Sam Stockhart. We got Warby Parker. We will not be able to run

49
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:48,000
advertisements on this episode or my brother, my brother and me. 9 to 1, good magic. I like that

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,520
what must have happened there is someone go, I know what we'll call this horse. We'll call it

51
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Great Magic. I like the word magic. We got to get this in the horse name somewhere. What's

52
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,920
a good modifier for magic? And then they thought about it for 14- Wait, what did you just say?

53
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Run it back a couple of words. We got Justify 3 to 1. Good odds there, I guess. I don't know

54
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:21,120
how gambling works. Lone Sailor. That's kind of a sad one. My Boy Jack. That's good because it's

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
exactly what I'm going to call the horse. You can give your horse a name and I'll just be like,

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:35,440
oh well that's my boy Justify. They went ahead and we got Mendelssohn. If I could give a wedgie

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,280
to a horse. Yeah, right? Griffin, read me 56 to 1 odds there. Oh yeah, you're talking about

58
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,880
entice. No, no, no. What I love, it must be clear, it is not entice or enticing but rather

59
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:59,760
the past tense, enticed. I have been enticed. Oh, a horse you say, I am enticed. Tell me more.

60
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:07,920
We have a combatant and at 77 to 1 odds, I doubt that very much. No, no, no, he is a combatant. 99

61
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,760
to 1. 99 to 1 is instilled regard so it's as good at racing as it is at having a fucking name.

62
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:25,280
60 to 1, Firenze Fire. This is about as good as it gets. Yeah, right? Yeah. Oh, hold on. The owner,

63
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
according to the Kentucky Derby website, is named Mr. Amore Stable.

64
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:45,440
What are you going to do when you grow up? What else have I got to do? What the fuck else can I do?

65
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,800
I love Stable. I love Stable. That's the Derby. Who won? I don't know. I don't want to spoil it.

66
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,800
Justify won? Justify I guess. I'm rich. I told my dad to put down 10,000 on Justify. So we're

67
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:08,480
looking good. You did that, right old man? We know who the winner is though and that's nobody.

68
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:18,560
This was the wettest Kentucky Derby ever. Louisville is like flash flood warning right now

69
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:28,800
and so I'm just saying let Firenze Fire... A lot of horses died. Can you stop making horny jokes

70
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:37,040
for like a second? I think if three horses die, that's too many. But two is... That's fine. I mean

71
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:46,800
you can't make an omelet, can't make a race omelet, etc, etc. This is an advice show as you

72
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,960
from a certainly guessed by now. It's not about any specific sci-fi franchises. It's just a regular

73
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:02,640
advice show. Was anybody at the Detroit show last night? Okay. Shit. So you keep what we did to

74
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:11,120
yourselves. Yeah. May take a while for that one to hit the old RSS feed. Some real desperate

75
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,680
circumstances. I just want to say one thing about that. I didn't get to... The whole reason... There

76
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,840
was one reason I wanted to do a show about Star Wars and it was to cover an important fact I

77
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,880
learned. I didn't get to say it so I'm gonna say it here so it's not lost to fucking posterity.

78
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:37,040
So you know the Cantina band, right? Okay. Tell us about it. It's just a band of weird dogs and

79
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,480
people and it's getting strange in space and they're not that good so they're playing at a bar

80
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,880
and one of the people and one of the things... Muppets. One of the Muppets in the band

81
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
is literally named Droopy McCool.

82
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
Steven Spielberg's friend George Lucas

83
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:13,840
reached into the future imagined our podcast stole a name from it took it back to 19 or

84
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,240
whatever 80 something and then put it into his show Star Wars because he named one of them

85
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,160
Droopy McCool. And somewhere a young Paul Reubens went that's a good name. Yeah here we go. I want

86
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,080
to open with Yahoo. Alexander Fitzpatrick sent this one in. Thank you, Alexander. It's Yahoo

87
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,160
answers users. Sorry something's gone wrong. Of course it's the fucking worst website ever made.

88
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,840
I can't believe how tied my career is to it. Droopy McCool asks...

89
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,160
Droopy McCool! Yeah it's great. It does sound like an AIM screen name like a 10 year old comes up

90
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:02,320
with. Droopy McCool. All right you're locked into that for the next decade. Droopy McCool asked

91
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,280
Scooby Doo question? Scooby Doo question. How did a dog have so much power in that series?

92
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,720
Dogs are usually subservient to the humans.

93
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,480
This is a great question. Wait how much power how much power did Scooby Doo have?

94
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
Very rarely were they like we're gonna go investigate this mystery and Scooby Doo is like

95
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,720
uh pass. Any power at all is too much power. There's a murderer at large.

96
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
It's been a while since I've seen Scooby Doo.

97
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:46,720
There's a murderer at large and the dog's like and you're like yeah no.

98
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,000
Unless it's like a canine unit and he sniffs murder drugs. I've lost what I was thinking of.

99
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
He is uh a lot of people don't know this he is a detective. Well we're tired. He's a reincarnated

100
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,840
retired detective. He's a bad detective not like bad lieutenant bad detective. Wait okay wait.

101
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,480
The bad detective that died. Yeah. And this came back as a dog to fight crime poorly. Obviously.

102
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
And once he solves 100 crimes he gets to go to heaven.

103
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Okay let me do a slight twist on this. Oh good. He is a bad detective. Yeah.

104
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh. Bad at his job or just crooked? Probably both. Yeah very rarely is there a cop who's like yeah

105
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,800
he's amazing at catching bad guys but also he is one. Uh okay but what about house?

106
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,840
How do you feel about that pool just a little in the moment behind the scenes?

107
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,200
Now listen I was trying to remember the name of the one with Rainn Wilson in it.

108
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:04,720
Mudd. No. Mudd? What? That's his character from Star Trek Discovery. The answer is Backstrom.

109
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,680
But that doesn't make it funny and that's so important. Okay so so here's the important

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,200
context about Scooby Doo. So he was tasked with solving 100 crimes. Yeah. To be freed from his

111
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,200
curse and then he found out about sandwiches. Yeah. And he was like oh wait fuck I didn't know

112
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,320
about these breaded delights. I don't want to go back. And that's why he's to hell?

113
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,160
How? Hold on. Very rarely is that what happens in cursed ghost shows is like and yes after

114
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,400
you complete 100 challenges you can go back to hell. Yes. Sick.

115
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,520
I think that the problem is they follow him a lot. The most unrealistic thing about Scooby

116
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,920
Doo if I can point to one. Wait no slow down. Uh-huh. The most unrealistic thing about Scooby

117
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,160
Doo if I can point to one is that they follow him a lot and he is never going over to hump something.

118
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,640
I think I think just once it should be like Scoob's got a lead and Scoob's like no no no no

119
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,880
do not follow me in here. I got dog stuff to do. I didn't see. Oh he's just shitting. Yeah I saw

120
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:21,440
I didn't see a clue. I saw a pillow that look had a crease in it. Is the clue under the crease pillow?

121
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,560
No I'm telling you. You guys have to fucking go somewhere else right now. Please give me one

122
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,160
minute to my fucking self and I would have gotten away with it. Oh shit what are you doing? What they

123
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,680
don't tell you is that Scooby snacks are full of dog Viagra. So every time that they give him one

124
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,840
a Shaggy one I don't know what it does to Shaggy. Trips him the fuck out. Trips out on dog Viagra.

125
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,640
But the thing is episode one of Scooby Doo he gets fixed and that everything I have to still be

126
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,960
fucking horny. A lot of you are really serious like oh what oh no. Also they would definitely

127
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,280
make Shaggy unhorny right? Probably. I went to Taco Bell for the first time in 12 years. Nice

128
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,720
congratulations. It's a question. I've been there much more recently than that and I realized once

129
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,560
I looked at the menu that I had no idea what to order. Like I would at other restaurants

130
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,200
I asked the cashier what would you recommend?

131
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Thank thank you for doing this for me. The cashier just stared at me so I guess that's

132
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,840
not a normal thing to ask at Taco Bell. You don't say. What can I do to feel like less

133
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,680
of an absolute dweeb after this? Also what should I order next time I go to Taco Bell?

134
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,160
That's from Crunchwrap Supreme embarrassment in Columbus. Are you here?

135
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:57,920
All right. I'm okay. Here's my question. I'm glad you're still with us. This is my question. You

136
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,800
don't have to answer it. It would be ridiculous if you did. You're not microphone. So you went

137
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,680
to Taco Bell not knowing what you wanted so you just looked at a Taco Bell and thought I like the

138
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,800
idea of that. Yeah I think it's fair to be like it was pretty buckwild last time I went in in the 90s.

139
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm gonna see what's up. There's a lot of smash mouth branding that went on. Let me find out real

140
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,160
quick what's going on at Taco Bell these days. My opinion is if you decide to eat at Taco Bell

141
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:37,680
you are already dead. You will die instantly as soon as the food crosses the plane of your

142
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,720
mouth hole. And so if you're gonna do it you may as well like if you're gonna go to town you might

143
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,840
as well go into Lincoln and you may as well get something in the Crunchwrap family. You may as

144
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:55,760
well get the dare food that we call Doritos Blasted Tacos. Some sort of Baja soda. Some sort

145
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,280
of Baja inspired soda would be a good compliment. My favorite menu item that Taco Bell ever offered

146
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,240
was called the Seven Layer Crunchwrap and they no longer take you. A lot of fond memories.

147
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:15,200
These are my people. It was my favorite thing and they discontinued it for safety reasons.

148
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,200
And uh but if you remember the components and honestly at this point it's like

149
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,280
go on can you just let me for a second. If you remember the components and it's been so many

150
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,160
years since they've offered this item it's basically folklore at this point. A spoken

151
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,680
tradition passed down through families that you how to get the Seven Layer Crunchwrap.

152
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,200
But when I go to Taco Bell literally for me ordering is like about five minutes long because

153
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,920
it's like not this not this add that add this and I'm adding some buckwild things.

154
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,040
I'm getting fucking guilt because I'm like and also red strips and like on the Crunchwrap

155
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,000
don't fucking give me shit. You came up with it got me hooked and then discontinued it's your

156
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,840
fucking fault. You're reverse engineering a Seven Layer Crunchwrap. I'm reaching into the past I'm

157
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,640
pulling out a Seven Layer Crunchwrap without lettuce or tomato because I'm eating Taco Bell.

158
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,160
How dare you. God it makes me angry.

159
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,600
It's a safety thing. It's like packing peanuts. Whatever space they take up in your stomach with

160
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:38,800
lettuce is space you can't put more Taco Bell into. Is it okay to ask what year their Mountain Dew

161
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:47,120
Baja Blast is? What the vintage? Garcon? Garcon? Garcon why would you pair? If the answer to that

162
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,600
question if the answer to the question what year is your Mountain Dew Baja Blast is anything other

163
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,960
than 2018. Ain't a good vintage. Don't do not do that dude. Also let's let's get let's be fair to

164
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,960
the cashier because I don't think it's just that they were unhelpful. You said what would you

165
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,640
recommend and they responded with silence. I think you got your answer. What should I have um

166
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,440
the void I guess you should have the void because there's no you should go over to Zaxby's

167
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,800
and fucking kick it. This is the closest that that cashier has ever felt to an EMT.

168
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,520
What should you get? Save a life. I could save someone. Now if I just save 99 more people

169
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,120
then I get to go back to hell.

170
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,480
How many references to the the 99 whatever. Two more and we get a free sandwich. Yeah yeah uh

171
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,320
this is Yahoo sent in from Alan Mulhall. 93 more and we get to go back to hell.

172
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Can't wait. What do you guys like to get hey just hold on a second what do you guys like to get at

173
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Taco Bell? The pizza. Sit back sit back in your seat. Griffin what do you like to get at Taco Bell?

174
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:14,080
I do the fucking Doritos Locos. I wasn't joking earlier like if I'm gonna fuck myself up I may

175
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,280
as well have the good mouth experience of the Doritos flavor. That's very true you wouldn't go

176
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,280
to Taco Bell and be like what's your healthiest option? Sydney does this. Sydney gets the tacos

177
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,880
fresco style. What? Just like fresh ingredients that they'll put on there legally. It's gonna

178
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,520
fuck you up either way. Okay Alan Mulhall sent this one in. Thank you Alan. It's an anonymous

179
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,200
Yahoo Answers user. I'll call him Jumbo. Is that because we said Columbo earlier? Maybe who knows

180
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,800
how the brain works. Jumbo asks my my grandfather is always trying to kill me in my dreams.

181
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,440
I have a good relationship with him but he is always trying to kill or harm me and sometimes

182
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:16,480
my mom in my dreams. What does this mean? How good could that relationship be? Yeah there's some deep

183
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,480
seated stuff there. I mean who knows how the brain works. It's a wonderful device the brain

184
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,680
because your grandpa comes to you at 8 pm and is like I hope you had a good day fishing Timothy.

185

187
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,200
The war the war for your dreams Timothy. That's right your pep pep's gotta gotta harvest your

188
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:05,360
dreams now. Step aside here hold my scythe. I'm gonna gather up your dreams my grandson Timothy

189
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,280
Krueger. Timothy is it bedtime already Timothy? We had a fun day of fishing. They go fishing

190
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,040
every day? Yes. They're fishermen what do you want? They have to make a living. What do they

191
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,800
just do? I got your Werther's original here for you to suckle on and let the sweet caramel taste

192
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,680
take you to dreamland. Good night Timothy. Timothy I got your poison Werther's original Timothy.

193
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,680
One of their one of their least popular variants of Werther's original. I love the soft caramel

194
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,000
not crazy about the poisoned. You can only find them in certain sit-gos. You have to defeat your

195
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,800
grandfather in your dreams. Yes. I'm sorry Justin if I know one thing about fighting dream walkers

196
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,360
you have to pull scary dream grandfather out of your dreams and fight him in the real world.

197
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,080
It's the kick and fight him in the real world. Yes Travis sorry I wasn't paying attention to

198
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,520
the last thing you said in your sentence which was super cool and made a heck of a lot of sense.

199
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,520
You gotta kick your real granddaddy's ass. I think we all now we all got there.

200
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,320
Dreams are just made up of things that you experienced in real life. Correct. So if you

201
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,720
kick your old dad's dad's ass frightening ass your brain is going to be like oh yeah I remember

202
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:37,440
that. Here's some super strength Timothy enjoy it. Yeah thanks dreams. Punch punch punch. It's

203
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,560
me your medulla oblongata I got you a sword because you beat up your old grandfather in

204
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,520
your real life. He was trying to teach you to fish and you punched him real good so here you go.

205
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey real grandpa I'm going to hold this sword and I need you to say I'm weak to being stabbed

206
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,720
by a sword out loud right now. Hold on let me remember it. Anything for you Timothy I love you

207
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,960
very much. I totally understand I've been there I had to kill my grandfather in my dreams. Thanks

208
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,520
Pep Pep I need to go to sleep right now while this is still fresh. Yes of course it's 4 30. Shall I sing

209
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,560
you a good night song? Yes please. Yes I love the good night song. Dr. Phil's not even over

210
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,160
I can't believe you're going to sleep already. My wife and I recently found out that we're going to

211
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,280
be having a boy in September. Naturally boy. That word's fucking ruined. But I'm a little worried

212
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,520
our son is going to want to play with my cool cool toys. I don't have any brothers so I never

213
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,720
had to share growing up and I'm still not good at sharing now. I'm worried that it's not going to be

214
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,720
so easy to share once he's here and wants to play. So my question to three dads who are also brothers

215
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,160
how can I tell my son not to touch my shit and to get his and to get his own toys that's from

216
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,040
Possessive in Pittsburgh are you here? Yeah. Listen as a dad I just want to say your head's in the

217
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,560
exact right place I think you're ready. This is what you should be thinking about for sure. You

218
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,160
really should because there's way more heinous shit that you're gonna have to worry about

219
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,560
savor these moments. Right and also I will say uh your your child's not here yet right?

220
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,480
Cool. So you got some time to get a second house that's your play house with all your fun toys.

221
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,840
Yeah. Like all well adjusted grown-ups. Yeah. That you're gonna have a lot of time to sneak off to.

222
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Because that is the thing that's surprising when you have a kid the free time. Yeah. It's abundant.

223
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,880
For you to hop in the car drive the 15 minutes to your storage unit where you can fondle your

224
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,640
amiibos and then drive back home. Because your child will look because of how often your baby

225
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,680
child will look at you and go you know what I'm good for 15 minutes. I'm solid papa. It's good.

226
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,760
No we're being mean. It's you can't really be afraid of the right stuff because for me I was

227
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,320
afraid of the poop part of it. When what I should have been afraid of is not that I would have to

228
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,560
touch the poop in some way when the diapers get changed. But that you have to develop a deep

229
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,360
fascination in how much you're going to have to investigate the poop for. Like fucking like the

230
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,720
guy that Jeff Goldblum plays in Jurassic Park and really get in there to make sure that. Malcolm

231
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,800
Gladwell. Yes. You're afraid of changing the diapers but you don't anticipate the moment

232
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,720
where you're like I can't believe they haven't shit in a while. I know. I miss it. God I would

233
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,520
love to change the diaper right now. The first time I my baby I changed a shitty diaper it was

234
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:49,040
very early on it was like second day. And that's one good day you had. You had one super good day.

235
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Well I mean like it was the next morning. Okay. And very early on when the baby shits it looks

236
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,520
like their butthole is blowing like a tar bubble. It's so fucking it's so fucking gnarly they don't

237
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,560
even call it poop. Yeah it's called like merconium. Yeah and it happened and I looked at the nurse.

238
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Somebody's cheering like yes I love it. Yeah that was the best. I looked at the nurse.

239
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,280
If Justin was the nurse I went like this. Okay I'm the nurse. Yeah. Yeah. Because I thought oh

240
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,800
that's the devil. Yeah. Coming out of my baby's butthole. Sin. All right we can't. That's actually

241
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,080
all your hopes and dreams. Yeah listen you are overest as a as a as a parent let me tell you

242
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,440
you are currently overestimating the value of the toys and underestimating the value that they'll

243
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,320
just fucking chill out for a second. If I I don't I don't know which of my earthly possessions I

244
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,520
would not trade away for my many children to just be fucking chill for a second.

245
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:58,240
Anything. My college diploma. Here my shorty award from 2008 for being great at Twitter. Here

246
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,760
flush it down the fucking toilet. This is an interaction that happens with Teresa and I

247
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,040
basically every day BB screams and reaches for something and I just instinctively go to hand it

248
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,360
to her. Teresa's like you can't give her a fork. Just give me a second. And I'm like but maybe it would be fine

249
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,480
after that. For like 45. If my son my 17 month old son could speak and say if you throw your Game

250
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,280
Boy in a river I'll chill for 30 seconds I would have to run the calculus and like do I can I take

251
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,760
the cartridge out and he's like no I no I I only like it because of all the Pokemon you're drowning.

252
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:46,000
Can I? No Papa I must feel alive. Daddy I only want you to drown the Pokemon that's why I'm

253
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,360
making you do this. Drown them for me dad. But I'll give you a half minute to say goodbye. To

254
00:28:51,360 --> 00:29:01,280
say goodbye. I'll be real quiet. Let me give you and everybody in the audience if you ever want to

255
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:09,680
have a child the number one pro tip that will protect your toys protect your child somewhat

256
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,880
just get them a big spindle of blank CDRs. Folks listen.

257
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,240
Take them off. Fun frisbee on the back side. It's like a little mirror for babies. They can put them

258
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,640
back on it can take them back off you don't need to burn a CD ever again because it's 2018. A big

259
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:40,240
spindle of blank CDRs. Although if you do burn a CD full of treasured family photos and then delete

260
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,000
them they will have a lot more fun with it. Yeah they'll be crazy about the idea that is amazing

261
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,600
intuitiveness of a child where you're like here are 50 hundred toys that I bought you and they're

262
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,240
like cool cool give me your phone. Yeah this is nothing. This is my only toy. I just want this.

263
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,760
This is a little portal daddy gets to look at to disappear for a second. We love our children though

264
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,280
and we love them so much. This is a yahoo sent in by Esther Joy. Thank you Esther. It's yahoo answers

265
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,120
user. I don't even want to fucking say this one time. I've had to say so many bad ones will you

266
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,840
do this one. Yes but I'm gonna pronounce it weird so that it is cloaked. Well you'll fuck it up it's

267
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:30,240
eat baby seals. Don't laugh like it's funny. This user asked how did you feel the first time

268
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:40,240
you ate at golden corral. When you first saw that beautiful avenue of sweaty food.

269
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:50,400
That temple of chumps. That fucking tenement of appetizers. Golden corral first time I ever ate

270
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,280
at golden corral was December the 24th. Oh Jesus. That was not the first wait no that was the first.

271
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,640
Can I institute our own no bummers policy. There's nothing that's a bummer about going to golden

272
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,320
corral Christmas eve the night the year after your mom died and visiting her tombstone and then

273
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,600
going to go just go out to dinner afterwards at golden corral. Yeah it's the least depressing thing

274
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,400
that's ever happened to anybody. Here's the thing the amazing thing about it is it did become. Hold

275
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,240
on take a second. We're gonna get back to jokes now and that was a joke of a different sort so

276
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,920
you're gonna need a second to sort of get back into the vibe. It kind of became straight out

277
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,200
of like a Zach Braff movie. It did get very Zach Braff. It was so depressing that it became funny

278
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,520
because of like this seems like a character of depression. We went to the owner of golden

279
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,760
corral and we're like could you stop playing Elliot Smith and he said we're not. It's just

280
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,120
you know that scene you know that scene in the santa claus. Don't laugh at that great thing I said.

281
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,960
Fuck. All right now see it's interesting. That scene in the santa claus where he looks around

282
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,560
and he's at all the other dads there. That was our golden corral experience because

283
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,040
it was packed. A lot of a lot of people who commuted from the cemetery. Yes. How did you

284
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:15,920
feel the first time you ate at golden corral? I one time went and ate at the golded corral. Yeah.

285
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,240
The gilded corral. I ate there before going on to high school because dad was doing an early morning

286
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,960
remote there so I went and had a 6 a.m breakfast. You got your belly full of learning fuel. I ate

287
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,960
a shit ton of gummy bears. It is it is weird the first because you're not quite a not quite a girl

288
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,400
not yet a woman and you're in that in between phase where someone says there's a bunch of gummy

289
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,280
bears up here and nobody's gonna say shit about it. If you do you know if you take your three-year-old

290
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,160
to golden corral on a saturday morning at 9 a.m there's cotton candy just like there.

291
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,640
Do you know this there's no one says no no one said no they say actually yes please feed the child

292
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,160
so we can harvest them. That is my favorite thing to watch. It's a big gingerbread house. To watch

293
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,880
the the the 7 a.m kind of golden corral breakfast that is both nine-year-olds and 90 year olds

294
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,720
who both don't care about where it's going after that. Yeah whatever. Oh Trav. It's just a little

295
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,280
much. Let me ask a follow-up. How did you feel after the first time you ate a golden corral?

296
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,200
Um like I could take on the world. I actually oh no I'm sorry like I had to shit real bad. Yeah.

297
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,520
I actually like golden corral. There's a lot of different food there for a real reasonable price.

298
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,160
Yeah you know what if you have a bad if you have a bad golden corral experience it's kind of your

299
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,800
fucking fault. Thank you. Are you telling me with an entire boulevard of food. Of broken dreams.

300
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,720
If you don't pick if you don't fill your plate with things that that good mood food then you're

301
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
it's your own fault. You can definitely find some edible stuff there. Hold on you won't make it sound

302
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,360
like there's a tiny door that if you just push through had good food behind it. There's a

303
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:13,440
metaphorical one for sure. It's not. They do toast. There's not a hackable way to have a good

304
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,960
feeling golden corral. I'm not saying you go there in the evening and have shrimp and prime rib. I'm

305
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,520
saying you go there in the morning they make this toast and I don't know how they're doing it. It's

306
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,040
butter. It's just a lot of butter and then they fry the toast but it is great. On my slow carb

307
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,640
cheat days I would roll in the golden crown and just eat a bunch of fucking bread. To be wait

308
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,640
hold on to be fair if it was a cheat day or last meal golden corral is the stuff. That's what it

309
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,360
says on their signs. I mean the picture of Jeff Foxworthy. If this is your cheat day or your last

310
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,160
meal welcome partner. It's a picture of Jeff Foxworthy in the electric chair like might as

311
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,920
well. He's holding four forks and it's just ready. That's a good hack actually. If you see your last

312
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,560
meal and you're like uh I want golden crown they're like okay and you're like sucker it's

313
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:10,800
an infinite meal dude. I never leave it. Are you full? Are you full yet? No. You've been to the

314
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:20,720
bathroom 48 times. You've been here two hours. You know they carve meat on site. What? On site. What?

315
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,920
Yes if you want them to cut up and cook some of their own hand they'll fucking do it. It's golden

316
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:35,280
corral have it your way baby. How about a mid yahoo. Okay yes. Mid final yahoo. It's from yahoo

317
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
and another anonymous yahoo answers user I don't have it in me to give them a funny name right now

318
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,360
I'll call them Mr Amor Stables. I found it. Asks when Dorothy goes back to Kansas at the end of

319
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,560
the Wizard of Oz what happens to Ms Gulch at the end of the movie? She never comes back again for

320
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,200
the dog. This would be the way better ending to the Wizard of Oz. Yes. If Dorothy comes back

321
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,720
and then Ms Gulch rolls up like sorry bout I'm glad you're safe. My house got fucked up it looks

322
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,960
like yours did too and this is like the dust bowl. We're gonna get through this together though.

323
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,120
Oh all your cows oh no oh no oh no. My husband got sucked up. Yeah he's gone. My husband got

324
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:26,240
forced through a tree. Yeah I haven't seen him yet. Gonna need that dog though. I'm gonna need to go

325
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,600
ahead and take the dog still. Nothing has changed vis-a-vis the dog. I understand that we're all in

326
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:42,160
a difficult place but law is law. Does she at some point produce a batch? Like as far as I know. She brings

327
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:50,560
the police? Wait I don't know. That's a slow time I guess for them. Why the fuck does she need the

328
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:59,280
dog? Because there's an infinity gem inside the dog. Okay we're done. That's good we're just gonna

329
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,720
leave it there it's fine it's fine. We'll be back after intermission. We love you. We'll be right

330
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:20,240
back. Hey everybody it's Griffin and we're gonna do the ads and I hope you're enjoying the live

331
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,680
show that we did in Columbus on our most recent tour. Travis is on vacation this week hence the

332
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,000
live show. Just a note about the audio we were trying to use these new headset mics that we put

333
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,960
on our faces so I guess we can do you know our Backstreet Boys moves and LARPing on the stage but

334
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,640
I don't like the audio quite as much and so if it sounds a little bit tinny that's that is why and

335
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,960
we're gonna go back to using stick mics I think from now on. Also as long as we're talking about

336
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,680
some bullshit you're about to hear in the second half of the show we started doing this new way

337
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,120
doing audience questions where we screen them ahead of time people send in one sentence emails

338
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,280
and we mentioned this at the beginning of the show and I cut a lot of it out because it took a very

339
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,800
long time but yeah we're doing a new way doing audience questions because the audience questions

340
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,720
had started to get a little they were moving away from like why we enjoyed doing the audience

341
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,680
questions in the first place and so we tried it this new way and I think it turned out really

342
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,360
really well and we we were really happy with with these these questions from the Columbus show so I

343
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,160
think that's how we're gonna do it from from now on so uh yeah you're gonna hear that here in just

344
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,000
a little bit but first I'm gonna tell you about some sponsors. First off I want to tell you all

345
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,280
about Bowl and Branch. Bowl and Branch they make all kinds of great cloth stuff mostly though I'm

346
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
gonna talk about those sheets. If you've ever stayed at a five-star hotel you know how good

347
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,320
you can feel in those sheets. Bowl and Branch sheets turn your bedroom into a luxury suite.

348
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,880
You're never gonna want to get out of bed again. I mean that was true before but for other reasons

349
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,640
but now that these soft sheets are here I've just kind of doubled down on the whole sort of concept.

350
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,160
Bowl and Branch sheets are crafted from 100 organic cotton that means Bowl and Branch sheets

351
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,480
not only feel incredible but they look amazing. You're getting twice the comfort and style at half

352
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,560
the price. You can try them for 30 nights and see for yourself and if you're not impressed you can

357
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,840
that you use when you need somebody for a job but you don't know them already. Like say for instance

358
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,960
I needed you know a zookeeper so if you're hiring while posting your position to job sites and

359
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,960
waiting and waiting for the right people to see it that stinks on high. Zip Recruiter revolutionized

360
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,440
hiring. Their technology finds great candidates for you, learns what you're looking for, identifies

361
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,720
people with the right experience, maybe zookeeping, and it invites them to apply to your job. Right

362
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,240
now our listeners can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com slash MYBROTHER. That's ziprecruiter.com

363
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,440
slash MYBROTHER all one word. Zip Recruiter the smartest way to hire. Zookeepers. I bought a zoo

364
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,000
and I have no fucking idea what I'm doing with these things. I want to tell you all about Return

365
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,680
to the Past. It is a podcast about it's a very niche podcast that I think that is the I can say

366
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,520
this it is the premier podcast about the subject that it covers. They say you know what we're

367
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,080
excited about brothers Code Lyoko a French cartoon from the 2000s that's part Matrix part soap opera

368
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,120
and part that show with the foreheads. We are three awkward 20-somethings and longtime fans

369
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,640
and we're so eager to talk that we made Return to the Past a podcast and they've put a hyphen in

370
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,480
between pod and cast which I've never seen before but it makes a lot of sense a podcast where we do

371
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,920
just that. Join us as we recap the show and kind of make fun of it but also get emotional at these

372
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,920
very good teens risking everything and saving the world. You can find this podcast on iTunes or

373
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,680
Google Play just search for Return to the Past or you can find them at at RTTP podcast on tweedo.

374
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,280
Here's a message for laser girl and it's from the professor who says happy birthday laser girl this

375
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,440
was as close to your birthday as I could get it's been a great few years with you and I can't wait

376
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:51,440
for more. We should play more D&D. I miss Riss Krangle and Blavid Dane. Let's get some fancy food

377
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,120
tonight cuddle up and watch some terrible movies love always. The professor wanted this around

378
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:04,720
their January birthday so just barely beefed it on that one by about you know a third of a year but

379
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:13,920
we do our best and here's a message for Sydney and it's from mom dad and Brian who say congrats

380
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,360
on graduating from college. We are so proud of you and excited to see your future. You'll always find

381
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,400
a D&D group no matter where you go. Sorry we couldn't go on the JoCo cruise last year but not

382
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,480
seeing Travis at Gen Con was your own fault. Travis is so omnipresent at this point what with his con

383
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,480
appearances and his book tours and his stand-up specials and his street busking that if you don't

384
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,240
have at least one Travis interaction like per month it really is your own fault. There's probably

385
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,520
more stuff that I'm supposed to talk about here in the ad section but I think we probably covered

386
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,080
it when we did the show in Columbus so I'm just gonna let you get right back the hell into it.

387
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,880
Um thank you again for listening we'll be back with another uh non non-live a dead episode

436
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,280
about a Dairy Queen escape room and I got really into it that'd be so good I because at the end

437
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,960
they turn you upside down and if you don't fall out of the cup you haven't done it yeah

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,040
exactly where they're sitting Logan don't use this information come on down come on down also

443

Jonathan main floor four row X seat nine go ahead and get on deck as they say in baseball there's

444
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,680
two are there two microphones I assume so Logan come over here say yeah let's get a little bit

445
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:12,560
of house life to be great thank you hello oh my god there's so many of you holy shit that's so

446
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,400
much faster and easier than trying to let you all down from a thousand feet away hey what's up hi

447
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,320
you're looking for mr. cream cheese yeah so go ahead and lay out the question there okay um so

448
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,760
I'm a new career teacher and I want to be a nice person angle the mic up a little bit yeah here's

449
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,920
fun so I'm a new career teacher and I wanted to have a nickname yes and my last name name rhymes

450
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,920
with bagels so I started off as mr. bagel but then they started calling me the various toppings

451
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:50,640
that go on a bagel yeah because yeah yeah that's just the way kids work and then the mister was

452
00:50:50,640 --> 00:51:00,560
gone and now I'm just tuna so my question my question is I want to roll this back because

453
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,360
I've clearly things have gone off the rails so where should the stopping point be and how do I

454
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,680
determine it yeah yeah yeah yeah all right the question you sent in by the way the reason we

455
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,840
chose this one is the question was simply and this is exactly what we want with this new thing we're

456
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,920
doing short sweet to the point and confusing as fuck because it was just how do I make my students

457
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:32,720
stop calling me mr. cream cheese now so mr. cream cheese here is my question so you got the shop as

458
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,280
a teacher and you thought I need to come up with a nickname for myself that rhymes with my nickname

459
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,000
because my students won't think to do that oh yeah how old are they uh middle school oh day one day

460
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,720
one day one day one day one they won't even hear it you could say what is your what is well no we

461
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,240
already know his first name so maybe we shouldn't give out the last name and what seed he's make up

462
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,960
another name that rhymes with your name and it's not bagel go squiggle squiggle yeah squiggle

463
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,200
if you say my name is mr. squiggle they will literally hear and process bagel oh yeah instantly

464
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,160
mr. bagel well I will say that maybe you got in front of mr. kegel and you might have

465
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:21,520
you did barely thought you might have just beaten that with bagel they're like okay I got an expensive

466
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,840
fix for you bringing a big box of fresh bagels every single day for your students and they're

467
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,120
still gonna call you mr. cream cheese or not a fit that's the bad news I guess and we should

468
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:39,600
have started with this there's nothing you can do oh yeah you think you you might be able to

469
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,520
control the damage enough to roll it back the cream cheese from tuna I think I'd rather have

470
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,880
tuna would you rather be mr. everything mr. everything is good mr. chive mr. lox it sounds

471
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:04,880
like a cool yeah yeah yeah like from lost so anyway you're fucked and but but it could be

472
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:13,680
it could be so so so much worse are you a good teacher they like you um I like to think so I

473
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,920
know you're fine then they're gonna call you what if what if with every different like incarnation

474
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,520
of nickname they give you you work that into the lesson plan okay so like you make it about tuna

475
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,920
that week and then they're like okay he's on the tuna we gotta change it to something else

476
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,200
and then you just keep working out until eventually they're out of ideas

477
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:39,040
and they just start calling you like sir also these are middle school kids have you said

478
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,920

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,200
um hey michelle i'm delighted that you're here yeah michelle before you get into it

497
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,200

498
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,360
okay well actually i sent in two questions so did you want the poop one or the co-worker one

499
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:18,480
you know i want the poop one why did you even ask michelle um okay so i have irritable bowel syndrome

500
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:27,760
what up you sound like chris tucker from uh fifth element when he talks about his ibs

501
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,640
yeah so i've had it for a few years now and i have this fear that follows me around that i'm

502
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,320
going to be in an inopportune place and i'm gonna poop my pants yeah like maybe an elevator that has

503
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,960
stopped working every time i get into an elevator i think is it gonna stop working am i gonna poop

504
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,880
my pants in front of the six people here that i work with every time i get on the highway i'm like

505
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,000
is there gonna be rush hour traffic am i gonna poop my pants in my car and because i know that

506
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,440
one of you shares my syndrome i'd be surprised if it was just one of us okay and another one of you

507
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,760
has occasionally mentioned times that he has pooped his pants yeah yeah i don't remember i

508
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,880
told you all the wendy's one right y'all heard that one yes and i've told you about the times

509
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,840
in high school all right michelle justin's just bragging in a way that he thinks is cool

510
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,000
i have nothing left let me ask you this well hold on what's your question well my question is

511
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,880
a how do i mitigate this fear so that it's not quite so crippling and b what's my game plan if

512
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,040
it actually happened okay okay i i have a question that i don't know might be pertinent but might

513
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,840
also be something i'm interested in yeah are you more afraid of pooping your pants in an elevator

514
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,760
on the way up a building or the way down a building oh my god i never thought about it before

515
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,560
yeah how tall would a building have to be that you'd be afraid of pooping in a run a working

516
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:05,280
elevator because i went up willis tower in chicago once and i didn't feel that urge at the ground

517
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,560
floor but by the time i reached the peak of beautiful windy chicago are we talking like some

518
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,960
sort of dubai building before it becomes a concern it only has five floors and i still you know feel

519
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,840
the fear so yeah uh well you could take that fear and harness it and turn it into podcast comedy

520
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,520
then you come over here that's fine it doesn't matter which microphone they're at um this is

521
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:36,400
a tough one because that uh the highway fear really resonated with me yeah yeah i had a high

522
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,240
school girlfriend and we went on a trip with her family to king's island and

523
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,280
we weren't in ohio yet though and

524
00:58:52,720 --> 00:59:00,720
we were we didn't ruin ohio for you no we were about four minutes out the driveway

525
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,400
of the house and i said we gotta stop at that fucking super america parents who i'm still

526
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:16,320
trying to impress are you impressed you saw me after you used your bathroom in your house four

527
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:25,920
minutes ago right excuse me girlfriends mom do you have any imodium that i can borrow yeah well

528
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:33,360
at the gas station i did sort of both things but this is the challenge and it can be you gotta

529
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:39,600
think of it this way it can be fun like a puzzle no no you gotta think about it fun like a puzzle

530
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,800
okay you gotta think about it like uh don't think about it like i have to go check out and make sure

531
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,800
what the bathroom is every public building that i go into for the rest of my life and think about

532
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,760
it more like i'm going to go on a wonderful whistle stop tour of all the bathrooms of every public

533
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,120
building i ever go into the rest of my life when you play you've got to be in this rest

534
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:06,560
job for 30 minutes and you don't know where the restroom is and you might have to ask a human

535
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:14,080
being yeah the anxiety on top of it doesn't help but if you look at it that way you can have some

536
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,600
fun okay with also i will say if you get stuck in an elevator even if it was like 10 minutes

537
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:27,520
if i knew someone had pooped their pants near me i would act even harder like it wasn't someone

538
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,280
who had pooped their pants then i don't know what my resting face of this person did not poop their

539
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,600
pants is but i would do it more like double down on it and there's a lesson in there

540
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
of some sort does that help

541
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,600
i think it might okay good thank you michelle can we still get more floor mics please there's

542
01:00:53,600 --> 01:01:02,560
like more on the floor mic thank you stevie stevie yes okay stevie your question was

543
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,720
a topic of much conversation backstage it delighted all of us to no end um i'm curious

544
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,760
can i actually this i would love to say stevie's question first uh because i'll be honest stevie

545
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,280
we mostly picked it because we had to know more yes with no context it might be the most

546
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,680
fascinating sentence yeah it's like cellar door it's how do i how do i tell people not to touch

547
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:38,400
fish when they touch the fish it is like the bare minimum amount of words it needs to be a sentence

548
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,960
yeah it's one of those sentences that has every letter in the english alphabet it's actually the

549
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:53,440
same backwards and forwards yeah yeah the palace stevie what the fuck first of all my name's not

550
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,040
stevie that was the name i made up in middle school so i have a secret email uh okay you've

551

553
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,520

563
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:35,120
at a Toys R Us you got it okay so people are touching the fish it seems we got uh we got some

564
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:41,200
reports of people touching the fish and how do you say like don't the person who designed our

565
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,560
department was an idiot they put it out so the fish can be out so you can touch it you're not

566
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,040
here okay i hope they designed it so the fish are all hanging for the ceiling you have to walk

567
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:58,560
through them like it's fucking gobel ducks it's a bunch of tables with fish on it and so out just

568
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:14,720
out there yeah that's what i thought i'll never forget my interview and hey i have one question

569
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,920
before the interview starts you guys seem to have left all your fish on the table is my job

570
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,520
number one put these away yeah i you want i should put these away for you well so we have the fish

571
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,640
out and we get it for you we get gloves and we pick it up and say which fish do you want we get

572
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,440
it and we wrap it up for you but sometimes when we're preoccupied with other customers some people

573
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,520
will think oh there's fish here i should pick it up with my bare like it's a caveman store yes

574
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,200
why doesn't anyone get this and we don't have a sign that's it what we do it's a tiny postcard

575
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,480
that says please don't touch the fish and i've constantly asked my higher ups can we put a bigger

576
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,840
sign this is please don't touch the fish you need you need one of those fish to be a big mouth billy

577
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:08,480
mouse that just goes please don't touch us ask somebody that's not the process because of the

578
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,240
nature of our store and being positive we can't put anything out that says no or don't which is

579
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:20,800
what is the store no don't say okay put up a sign that says touch other fish

580
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:32,000
but but but we love your impulse we love the impulse touch other fish but put it but put it

581
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:41,840
on every fish please use other fish so like i have two problems one how do i get people to not touch

582
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,560
the fish yeah and me being the abrasive person i am i'm really bad at telling somebody yeah you've

583
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,040
really rubbed off the wrong way on us you definitely haven't delighted us for the past five

584
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:57,200
minutes great well i'll see someone pick up like a 50 red snapper over the dirty floor and it's like

585
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,000
no don't they bought it just tell them they bought it you just bought that snapper idiot well

586
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:09,200
i hope you're enjoying fucking pretending making it talk like you just bought it like i asked people

587
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,280
like have you ever been to a place where you pick up your own raw fish like no it's like why do you

588
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,520
think this is any different just make them buy it they touch the fish or they put it down and walk

589
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,880
away because i upset them because i was like don't touch the fish okay if someone in a really nice

590
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,440
apron told me you just bought that fucking fish stupid i would pick it up and go to the cash

591
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:36,000
register leave my purchases there in a pile and i would buy just the fish and i would move

592
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:49,120
caesara i i think i can't stress enough if someone picks up the fish and you say don't

593
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,680
touch that fish and they put it back down they weren't planning on buying that fish they didn't

594
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:00,000
even want a fish they were just joking around with that fish they were flirting with that fish

595
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:07,520
but they weren't willing to date that fish isaac yes gotta move the fucking fish my dog

596
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:16,960
this is no no no no excuses this is wild there's no better answer than your store is broken you

597
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,680
understand this here's what you do you screw a couple of the fish to the table okay they go to

598
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,600
pick it up and you say oh that's just display fish did you want the real fish they're behind

599
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,400
the counter they're behind the counter we don't have a meat lives you don't have a counter we

600
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,560
have you actually work at a store wait hold on isaac this is important do you actually work at

601
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,160
a whole foods or did somebody just tell you you're doing at the table of fish in a parking lot

602
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,840
it's just what is this this open concept montessori whole foods that you work at

603
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,840
where everybody can have their own fish touch experience i don't know our meat department has

604
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:01,040
our meat in a case but our seafood department doesn't you can just walk up to it and touch

605
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:06,720
the fish if you wanted to but you shouldn't no don't touch it well here you're getting the word

606
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,440
out isaac there's uh you know 2500 of your closest friends they're not gonna touch the fish anymore

607
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,080
not gonna touch the fish anymore please don't and honestly i think you're hitting a surprisingly

608
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:22,800
large portion of the whole foods crowd in the region i think you've done great work here and

609
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:28,640
actually everybody tell everyone you know don't touch the fish at whole foods please it's important

610
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,880
and that should help to spread the word thank you isaac thank you you were a treat one last one

611
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:44,880
callie callie hello hey what's up callie can we should we lead with callie's question yes you

612
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:51,680
should justin here's callie's question how can i get the tom brady of washing dishes to keep

613
01:08:51,680 --> 01:09:02,960
the kitchen floor drying excuse me so um my husband worked at mench's brothers for a while

614
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:16,080
okay as a dishwasher and he was dubbed the title the tom what does that mean he's really good at

615
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,680
washing dishes he's really good at it okay at mench's brothers okay interesting distinction go

616
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:28,080
on um he washes dishes at our house that's wonderful i'm not complaining that he washes

617
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:34,480
dishes yeah you are a little bit no i mean okay a little bit you are standing at the microphone

618
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:43,280
yes he um makes our kitchen floor a lake he takes the spray hose and just like

619
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:50,480
okay just like tom brady just like tom brady well the issue is that he doesn't care about it

620
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:57,040
he doesn't notice it because he's about results yeah the dishes are clean true or false the dishes

621
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:02,560
are clean i'm worried about our children slipping okay tom brady isn't worried about his children

622
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,320
nice he's just out there getting rings

623
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,160
he's not worried about if his children are going to choke on those rings

624
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,640
so the problem is that and mitch's what's mitch's brothers it's a

625
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,440
burger place okay so i'm assuming that like if the floor gets wet there it just dries later

626
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:32,000
yeah at the end of the night typical restaurant thing um we used to do this at the olive garden

627
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,360
you'd spray the oh this story makes me want to barf every time you tell it

628
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,200
that's our i won't tell it that no go ahead you spray the floor over the hose and the

629
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,960
pasta water gets on your pants they call it og water and it would just soak through

630
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,640
it's rough it's no return your white pants khaki it smells like the devil's dick it's the worst

631
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:59,440
thing ever just would come on every day um so is he here by the way yeah he's way up there

632
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,600
can he just stand up and take a bow it's just such an honor to meet the tom brady oh my god

633
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:16,320
um here's here's the problem you could have him start mopping up the floor and he's going to do

634
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,720
a killer job of that too but then somehow he's going to like get the ceiling dirty

635
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,640
it's a little old lady who swallowed the fly situation right the main issue is we have a

636
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:34,960
dishwasher like we have yeah his name is the tom brady don't put him in a fucking john henry

637
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:43,520
scenario where you're like okay equal number of dishes equal amount of dirtiness who gets the

638
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,800
floor more wet you put a load in the dishwasher you give him the half of them you say whoever

639
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,800
gets the dishes the cleanest and also keeps the floor the driest will be declared the winner

640
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:02,000
i can do that he'll he'll be cool with it well i mean nobody likes what do you hey

641
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,520
everybody be so quiet do you like washing dishes

642
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:16,480
is he said he loves it folks at home he said he loves it yeah we can't take this away from him

643
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:23,280
maybe you can be the other good football player of floor drying you can be you can be the ground

644
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,880
cowsky of drying with is that an option that's a thing can you tie towels that's a football name

645
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,360
you said you did you say you have kids we have twins can you tie towels to their feet

646
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:40,800
i can't get in the way of his dream and his art if i may be so do you not want him to go pro

647
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,520
do you think chazelle looked at tom i was like you're getting the floor wet tom you gotta back

648
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,640
down and he said but i gotta get those rings a 98 yard touchdown pass he made the field all wet

649
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:59,600
though so fuck that guy there's a lot of work around drying the floor is way easier than

650
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,040
cleaning a bunch of sticky old lasagna off a bunch of nasty old plates ew gross
