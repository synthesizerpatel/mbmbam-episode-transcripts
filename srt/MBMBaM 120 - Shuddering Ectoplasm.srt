1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:44,240
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,240
oldest brother, George Lopez. I'm your middle-est brother, Phil Lamarr. I'm your baby brother.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,280
And unfortunately, I am Ernie Hudson. Hey, do you guys wanna hear about my Pokemon card strategy?

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,400
Do you wanna rap about it? It's based mostly on powerful evolutions and power stacking.

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,120
As you can certainly tell, we have been swept up in Beverly Hills, Chihuahua,

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:27,440
three, viva la fiesta. BH3. Biba, biba la fiesta. Let me tell you, because I do speak about six

12
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:35,280
years of educational Spanish, that means live the party, which is now my new life's motto.

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Live the party. Now, this film is directed by Lev Spiro, who I'm looking at is IMDB.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,160
You know him from other films. He is directed like Modern Family. Oh, but I like that TV show.

15
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,160
The kids are, they're sagacious. They talk like, kids don't talk. Let me hit you with this.

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Wizards of Waverly plays the movie. You might also know him from Super Ninjas.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,600
That's S-U-P-A-H Ninjas, Super Ninjas. That is also another-

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,560
Now, I'm sitting here, I'm looking at the IMDB page, and under the trivia, the did you know,

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,960
the only thing listed is that there's a connection to Beverly Hills Chihuahua 1.

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,200
I should fucking hope. Yeah, I don't know. They tried to reboot the whole franchise.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
Yeah, it's like a separate but parallel Chihuahua verse.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,800
You know what connection there isn't though, and that is French Stewart. I think that French Stewart

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,720
listened to the episode of the podcast where we inexplicably savaged him, and then he just popped

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,520
on Man in the Mirror, and then he said, no more. This far, no further.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,680
Griffin, I like that you're living in such a utopian society in which you believe that that

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,480
is what happened, because my fear, my worry, is that what happened was all the executive

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,200
producers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3 got together, and somebody said, oh, what about

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
French Stewart? And they all kind of like, no one would make eye contact with each other,

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
and they're just like, we don't want him back. That's even worse.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
Aw, can we do one episode without beating up on French?

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,560
No, I think that French, I think he's reinventing himself, or alternatively,

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,240
they said, let's put him in three, and then some producers are like, no, no, no.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,240
You got to have a long lead ideas when you're dreaming up the BH franchise, and just imagine-

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,040
You want to leave some room to go narratively.

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,640
BH3, it's going to be strong enough to stand on its own legs sans French Stewart. We got

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,840
Ernie Hudson's in the mix. We have Emily Osment. We have, oh, we have Kyle Gass. That's no good,

37
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
but it's going to be-

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,800
That's blowing me out. Tom Cain's going to be in the mix.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,640
That's blowing me out. Tom Kenny is there by law, as dictated by law. There is voiceovers to be done.

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,840
That's actually in all of it. Every single movie with voiceovers is in the contract. Tom Kenny,

41
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,520
he can just sit by and drink coffee and watch other people do voiceovers,

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,480
but he has to be there.

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm saying it's strong enough. Don't push the river. Don't shoot the cannon indoors.

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
Let's say French Stewart for the quattro, you know?

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
He's got to come back, so it's like a big turn.

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, you thought he was dead at the end of two when he fell in front of that steamroller,

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,760
but no, he is back in the quattro.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,600
He's back as flat puppy.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
This time, this time, the Chihuahuas are going to France, and it's going to be fun because that's

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,920
like, it's part of his name. We'll see you in the quattro, French.

51
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,560
Don't you think French Stewart would be good, speaking of being run over by a steamroller,

52
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,880
don't you think French Stewart would be good if they remade Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the bad

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,680
guy, Dr. Sludge or whatever? Yes, of course he would.

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,840
I mean, then we got to replace Bob. What's the detective? Bob Fudgeons is an actor.

55
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes, Bob Fudgeons.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
Bob Fudgeons is Ernie Valiant. He's got to be replaced by...

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,240
Wasn't it Bob Hoskins?

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
Also French Stewart.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
Sorry, Griffin, what is the name? Bob Hoskins.

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Bob Hoskins, not Bob Fudgeons.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
No. I am sorry about that.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
You were close.

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Bob Fudgeons is evil Bob Hoskins.

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,080
Right. So we get French Stewart as Dr. Bad or Dr. Mean, I forget.

65
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,200
And then as the rabbit, that's going to be CG.

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
I think Tom Kenny will legally have to do his voice.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
It'll be that guy who did Gollum. What's his face? What's his name?

68
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,760
Yeah, they're going to mocap Andy Serkis to play Roger Rabbit.

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,680
Now, that's a funny connection because Peter Jackson is doing the quattro.

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
So I'm afraid French Stewart, when we catch French in the quattro,

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,040
he is going to be in the mix for like 10 years that he cannot be shooting anything else.

72
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,200
They are really tying him up with the quattro.

73
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
But hopefully he'll be able to make time for the shooting schedule

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,320
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit Again.

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
Is that the name of the movie? Who Framed Roger Rabbit Again? Layoff?

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,000
Who's Still Framing Roger Rabbit?

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Featuring the voices of John Travolta and Roseanne Barr as the babies.

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,680
All right. Time to get to the advice.

79
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm currently getting ready to ask my girlfriend of four years to marry me,

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,720
but a bit of an issue has come up.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,320
While talking to her recently, she mentioned that her parents were a bit concerned

82
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,000
that I had not yet talked to them concerning my proposal.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
She threw me for a loop.

84
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,880
Is talking to her parents, namely her father, who thinks I'm a screw up,

85
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,920
necessary in this day and age, or is that tradition that went away in the fifties?

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
That's from Confused in California.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,160
No, it's still very much a thing.

88
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Yeah, so I've only ever gotten engaged the one time,

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,160
but my thought on this is whatever they think is a tradition is the tradition.

90
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah, I think you should probably get a read on how traditional they are,

91
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,400
which I think is going to help you to light your way here.

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,640
I don't think that this gesture would ever be...

93
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,840
I mean, I do understand there's inherent sexism in the gesture,

94
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,440
but I don't think that it's necessarily going to offend anyone doing it.

95
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,120
I mean, I think you run a much greater risk of offending people by not doing it.

96
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
Oh yeah, like Teresa's parents.

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
I was talking with Teresa before I did it,

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
and I was like, I want to talk to your parents first.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,760
And she was like, they don't care.

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't worry about it.

101
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
And I was like, yeah, but I do.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
And it was still a very nice moment,

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
even though it's not like if I had proposed without asking,

104
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
they would have been super offended or anything.

105
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,320
Can you guys tell me...

106
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,080
It was just a nice moment for us.

107
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
I want to hear your stories.

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
I want to hear stories from Justin,

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
and I want to hear stories from Travis about how this went.

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Because Justin, I know yours was kind of a panic attack.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,480
Yeah, I'm not good at anything that happens in this whole procedure.

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,960
And I asked my now mother-in-law if she and my father-in-law

113
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,240
could meet me at their house on their lunch break.

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
Which I love.

115
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
And I'm like, come on back to the house.

116
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Let's just like talk this through.

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
Because you start out by inconveniencing them.

118
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
I know, this is like full panic attack.

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,040
And I ask them, I say, well, I'd like to...

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
You know, they guessed, they knew the jig was up.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
And I am like...

122
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
They somehow put two and two together?

123
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,680
What if you just got them some subs, some Subway subs,

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
and they just called and you thought,

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,760
I just thought this would be a nice thing for us to do together.

126
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
We had Subway Sub-Wednesdays.

127
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Would you come back to the house on your lunch break?

128
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
I want to point out all the messes you need to clean up.

129
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,280
Listen, so I'm in the middle of asking, and they say yes.

130
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
And then my now father-in-law says,

131
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,320
I would like to ask that you would consider maybe holding off

132
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
on getting married until after she had finished medical school.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
Because I wouldn't want anything to get in the way of that.

134
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
And that was three years away.

135
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
So I like slapped my hand down the table.

136
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,360
I was like, listen, back off.

137
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,800
This part of the story.

138
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
I don't remember that part.

139
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
I said, back off.

140
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
I think it's getting fictitious.

141
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,920
And then your 9 foot tall father-in-law stood over you.

142
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
Even if your father-in-law was not a 9 foot tall,

143
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
I would say Conan-esque figure,

144
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
you would still probably not have the gumption,

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
the vim to pull that maneuver off.

146
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
No, I just said like, I'll think about it.

147
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
And then we just never brought it up again.

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
And then you got married six months later.

149
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah, I got married six months later.

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
That was my play there.

151
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
I worked out pretty good.

152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,400
You didn't send him an invitation to the wedding

153
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,120
until the day before.

154
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
Yeah, he just didn't bring it up again.

155
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
So I was like, well, I guess this is cool.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
I guess we're cool.

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
Now, to be fair, you really did tie Sydney down

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,960
while she was in med school.

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,760
Are you kidding me?

160
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
You burned all her books.

161
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
The crazy thing about his assertion is that

162
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760
I would ever do anything to get away of me making that money.

163
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,160
I know.

164
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,240
I gotta get paid.

165
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,600
Travis, yours I imagine was much smoother.

166
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Well, I mean, it was in the fact that we took them out to dinner

167
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
in Dayton so they didn't have to drive down to Cincinnati

168
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:28,960
or anything.

169
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Can you drive down to Cincy on your lunch break?

170
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,880
My plan originally was when Teresa gets up from the table,

171
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,560
you know, use the bathroom or something,

172
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,320
or she goes away to check on whatever, I'll do it.

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,080
And I told Teresa that at about 10 minutes in, 15 minutes in,

174
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,320
she's like, well, I'll be right back when we go to the bathroom.

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
And I stood up with her and walked over and was like,

176
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm not gonna do it until you come back.

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
I can't do this without you there.

178
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
She was like, okay, cool.

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
So I made her sit at the table while I asked her parents.

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
Push your courage to the sticking point, Travis.

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,160
I didn't at all.

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
I pushed out.

183
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,280
I was so freaked out in that moment.

184
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Travis, I would like to formally request

185
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
that you start referring to me as King Nuggets.

186
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
The king of having nuggets.

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
That is the full title.

188
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
The thing is-

189
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,240
Let me hear it once and kind of try it on for size.

190
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,680
So here's the thing, King Nuggets.

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,440
Her dad is like a hardcore like Air Force guy

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,480
and has been like, he's a lifer and he's a very,

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
he likes me, he's a nice guy,

194
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
but he's a very quiet, reserved guy

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
who usually answers in monosyllabic responses.

196
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,960
And like the idea of carrying on a conversation

197
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,480
about how I was gonna marry his,

198
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,760
you know, like be the first person to marry one of his daughters

199
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
was like the most terrifying thing to do

200
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
without Teresa being a trans- Travis, my father-in-law

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
is nine feet tall and his hair is made of fire

202
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
and he is always riding a horse.

203
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
My father-in-law could rebuild a car

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
like blindfolded in a cave

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
and knows more about being a man than I would ever-

206
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
Guys, guys, there's only one way to settle this.

207
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,080
We need to get your fathers-in-law to fight each other.

208
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,800
Well, my father-in-law is recuperated from knee surgery, so he's gonna-

209
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,880
Then it might just be fair.

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,440
I think my future father-in-law will do very well,

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
like in the Hunger Games, like setting up traps

212
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
and knowledge of weapons and whatnot,

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
but hand-to-hand, I think that Justin's father-in-law would win.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
I think it is a, I personally think it is a nice gesture.

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,040
And again, I do think you run more,

216
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
especially if the dad already thinks you're kind of whack.

217
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
You are not gonna do anything to assuage him of that.

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Like, not doing it feels pretty excuse-y from where I'm sitting.

219
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
And if you have issues like it's sexist

220
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
or I feel like it's outdated, then I mean,

221
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
I think it's completely justified to make it an opportunity

222
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,720
for you and your girlfriend to talk to both sets of parents,

223
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
have a time with her parents, sit down with your parents

224
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,120
and say, hey, we're planning this, this is gonna be coming up

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,840
because they're both gonna be involved in the wedding,

226
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,040
so both sets of parents.

227
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

228
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
I think that you could make a legitimate case

229
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,200
for having both people present if you felt it was a sexist gesture.

230
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,800
I think it's nicer to do something, though,

231
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,400
to show that you are looking for their approval.

232
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Like getting them some Subway subs on their lunch break.

233
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
Just picking up some Subway subs on their lunch break.

234
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Or at the very least, like one of the cards

235
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
with like 10 holes punched in it,

236
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
so they can go pick out their own sub if they want to.

237
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
To show you that I am a viable financial supporter

238
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,960
of your progeny, here's seven out of eight

239
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,480
punched on this Quiznos card.

240
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
Where it goes next is completely up to you.

241
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't worry about us or our kids.

242
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm already, I'm not looking for,

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
I think mine, when I do have this talk,

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,080
it's gonna be very uncomfortable

245
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,720
because I am going to request no visitation.

246
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,880
I see.

247
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,680
Just from the jump, from the get-go, legally.

248
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
You know that you're not like adopting her.

249
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,040
I just think it gets confusing for her, you know?

250
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
She's gonna be like, which family am I a part of?

251
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,600
And it's like, I just don't want her to ever question, you know?

252
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:25,840
Right.

253
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,360
And you don't want to have to rely on shaking the no-no can

254
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
for the rest of your years.

255
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,840
You need to set boundaries for the beginning, right?

256
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Now the no-no can, that is a can full of beans

257
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,040
that shakes and she gets scared of the sound?

258
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
You can also do a spray bottle

259
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
if she gets up on the furniture.

260
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,200
But this is not sexist by the way.

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,120
I am seeing a raccoon.

262
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm romantically entangled with a raccoon.

263
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,120
I was gonna suggest an invisible fence also would be great.

264
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,960
She listens to this show.

265
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,880
She's not gonna enjoy this part.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,380
Sorry.

267
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,640
Sorry, baby.

268
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,720
I love you so much.

269
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
Let's do a yahoo.

270
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
Sorry, cluck, cluck, cluck.

271
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Oh man, she's actually sitting 20 feet away.

272
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm so sorry.

273
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,280
She's just gnawing on his furniture in defiance.

274
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm gonna eat this pillow.

275
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
Let's do a yahoo answer.

276
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,520
Oh, this one's good.

277
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,800
This one was sent in by Lizzy Cross.

278
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,360
Thanks, Lizzy.

279
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,160
It's by yahoo answers user, Black Sunday Mold.

280
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,520
Who asks, oh, his avatar is poop in a toilet.

281
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,440
I do not want to look at that anymore.

282
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,800
How to make 11-11 wish not come true.

283
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,280
So last time during 11-11, I made a wish to see my sister.

284
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm studying overseas soon.

285
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,520
When I wish for 11-11, I usually repeat the wish out loud

286
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,720
until 11-11 is done.

287
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
So for a minute, I kept saying I wish to see my sister soon.

288
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,080
But out of nowhere in the middle of my wishing, I suddenly said,

289
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,440
I wish I was Latin American.

290
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
said I wish I was Latin American.

291
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,880
OK, obviously, I don't want to be Latin American by the parameters.

292
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
OK, I obviously don't want to be Latin American.

293
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,080
I think my Chinese mix is all right with me.

294
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm not being racist or anything.

295
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,520
With a Latin American wish come true.

296
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,560
Also, after that accidentally slipped out, I still kept on saying I wish to see my sister.

297
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,280
Please help.

298
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,520
Would the Latin American wish come true?

299
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,560
I wish to see my sister.

300
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
I wish to see my sister.

301
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
I wish I was Latin American.

302
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
What the fuck?

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,280
Why did what a Freudian?

304
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,840
I think that this dude needs to open up to the fact that he does, in fact,

305
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
wish he was Latin American.

306
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
Yeah, you know, maybe he does.

307
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,720
There's something in you that needs to just let that that carefree spirit out, you know?

308
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
Yeah, feel the rhythm of the night.

309
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
Feel the rhythm in your bones.

310
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,960
It's in you.

311
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,440
Is there another like if you make a wish at 222, it never, ever, ever will ever come true.

312
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,400
That's another one that people don't really know much about.

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,920
That's a rhyming couplet, actually.

314
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,080
I think that whichever one you wished more, I'm not sure about the technical,

315
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,720
but I think whichever one you wished more is the one that legally has to come through.

316
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't think so.

317
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,200
I think you can get a fraction of it, you know?

318
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,960
You might get like 66.6 repeating percent, I want to see my sister.

319
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,680
But I think when you wake up the next morning, you are going to be one third Latin American.

320
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, I think the thing with that is it's like a numbers game,

321
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,640
where if you say you want to see your sister, I don't know, like 26 times,

322
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,760
and you say you want to be Latin American once, there's a one in 27 chance.

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,920
Okay, or if we go with the fractional rule, I didn't even consider the horrifying possibility

324
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,880
that you do wake up one 27th Latin American, and then your sister shows up, and maybe she's missing

325
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:56,800
a hand. Maybe she forgot who you are, or maybe.

326
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,880
And then you have to go find Doc Brown in the DeLorean.

327
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,240
What is one 27th Latin American look like? Does that just mean you can pull off white dress shoes?

328
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
Is that the only chain?

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,840
I want you guys to know that I'm sitting here dealing with the horrifying reality that I don't

330
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,360
know a single thing to say here that isn't just incredibly racist.

331
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
Yeah, that's great, Travis.

332
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
Well, I've accepted it. I've learned it.

333
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,640
Well, now you've got a nice blend because you've admitted that you're racist without

334
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,840
just saying anything funny, which is good because it's sort of like the worst of both.

335
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,240
I think the only problem is we're all sitting here trying to think of something funny that

336
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,760
applies to every Latin American person, and I think that is actually the dictionary definition

337
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
of what racism is.

338
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,360
So you're saying we need to make it broader and be like, you know, he's one 27th Latin

339
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,960
American, so he really enjoys America's next top model.

340
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,760
Or I think we, yeah, we explore options that don't make a lick of goddamn sense at all,

341
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
which is still racism.

342
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
You just say literally the first goddamn thing that comes into your head.

343
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Basically.

345
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,560
Like they, maybe they all really like going to the opera. Everybody knows that.

346
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,520
Everybody knows that.

347
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
Everybody knows that.

348
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
They're ambivalent towards pancakes.

349
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,640
Don't bring that. Don't bring that pancake passer around here. I offer him pancakes,

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,720
he passes them right back to me. He says, I don't know. Pancakes. I don't know right now

351
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
about pancakes.

352
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
A closer?

353
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,880
A closer? I'm a Latin American Canadian, eh?

354
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,480
They, they, they took all the jobs from Australia though.

355
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,880
Okay. Yeah, right.

356
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
And gave them to Great Britain and then just kept passing them around.

357
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,480
What if they are taking our jobs, but then they're giving, they're like the Robin Hood

358
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
of jobs.

359
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,920
They're hiding them in places we'll never find them.

360
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,840
You know, I heard Latin Americans buried like 10,000 jobs in a landfill in New Mexico somewhere

361
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
and you have to go find them.

362
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
And if you're the guy who finds them, then you get them all.

363
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
It's going to really take a chunk out of your free time.

364
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,600
I never see Mark anymore.

365
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, he's got, he's holding down 10,000 jobs.

366
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
He found them in a Latin American landfill.

367
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,120
Every stump speech.

368
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,560
He's really rich, but he is so tired.

369
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,400
Every political stump speech ever.

370
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Some people are trying to work 10,000 jobs just to make a, just to make a living.

371
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,560
They found them in a secret Latin American landfill.

372
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
What are we fucking talking about anymore?

373
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,800
The secret Latin American, that's why you, that's why Americans are working longer at

374
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,200
hours in their jobs, statistically speaking, because they're afraid to turn their backs

375
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,920
on them.

376
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,320
The Latin Americans will come and sweep them away and hide them in a, like a burrow or

377
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,560
something.

378
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,680
They don't see my desk?

379
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,560
Yeah.

380
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,680
Hey, where's my desk?

381
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
Well, don't look up in that tree.

382
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
I didn't hide it up there.

383
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,240
God damn it, Manny.

384
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,680
Oh shit.

385
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,880
Manny's the fat baby on, on, uh, uh, Chuckle Family.

386
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,160
What's that fucking shit called?

387
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Yeah, Chuckle Family.

388
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,600
Uh, Family Matters.

389
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,520
I don't think, I don't think it's Family Matters.

390
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,320
Modern Warfare?

391
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,160
Okay, I got another question.

392
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,400
Okay.

393
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
Sorry if anything we said offended you, by the way.

394
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,800
I did?

395
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,760
Let's lay down that blanket.

396
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
But if it did, I don't-

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,480
It didn't make any sense.

398
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,320
I, if we, my worry is that we like stumble on a real bad one.

399
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
We fucking love pancakes.

400
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Yeah.

401
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
How'd they know about that?

402
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,800
I hate these gringos.

403
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,440
See, look.

404
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,920
Using the terminology.

405
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
I, I, I, yeah.

406
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,360
There's going to be some judicious editing on that portion.

407
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
Oh, golly.

408
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
It will take hours.

409
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
Hours of deliberation and Googling.

410
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,840
And those listening at home may have just heard

411
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,560
like 10 to 13 minutes of silence.

412
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,840
Straight silence.

413
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,400
I just hope you cut out Justin's whole La Cucaracha rant.

414
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
That's where it got pretty bad.

415
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh man.

416
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:14,800
So.

417
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,480
Oh, great lost bit.

418
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,160
Great, great classic lost bit.

419
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,360
Launch it into space and maybe somebody will find it.

420
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
Some Martian civilization.

421
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,560
Hey, so I've started dating this guy who seems pretty cool,

422
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
but I'm converting to Catholicism,

423
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,640
which means that premarital sex has to go.

424
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be happy about it if he knew.

425
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,200
So how long is it going to take him to either leave me or cheat on me?

426
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,960
Or is this something you guys are really willing to put up with?

427
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,920
If they like you, that's from Gmail.

428
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,840
That's from Gmail. To be fair, it says that that guy's not us guys.

429
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Okay, that guys are really willing to put up with if they like you.

430
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah.

431
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,480
I don't think.

432
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,760
I don't think you can lay down that blanket statement

433
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,440
because there's got to be guys who who who honor the the true love weights.

434
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
Of course there are.

435
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
Yeah, yeah, certain.

436
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,040
Yeah, but.

437
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
I don't know your dude.

438
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,760
You didn't give us any deets on your dude.

439
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah, without any sort of deets on your dude,

440
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,920
it's going to be hard for us to to delineate.

441
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,760
I think the important thing here is going to be honesty

442
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,040
and forthrightness that you, you know, lay it out for him.

443
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,000
You know, the the as honestly and directly as you can.

444
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,040
I would caution you, however, and point out that.

445
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
Just because you're converting to Catholicism,

446
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
people fuck up on their religions like all the time.

447
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
You know, like that's kind of the whole bit is like messing up.

448
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,880
And then messing up and coming back.

449
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,320
But we don't have to come back.

450
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,800
We shouldn't tell anybody to do something less than the best of their ability.

451
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
No, I'm not trying to give you permission.

452
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
You should be the best Catholic you can be.

453
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't get me wrong.

454
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,160
It will feel so dirty and good because now it's forbidden.

455
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,760
Yeah, forbidden for.

456
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,480
So it is going to feel it's going to feel better.

457
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
It's going to feel wetter.

458
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,960
It's let's.

459
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
But listen, just listen.

460
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,400
Mouth stuff.

461
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
You can go right now to extremistraights.com.

462
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Coupon code Middle East and you will find things there

463
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,480
that I'm pretty sure do not qualify as intercourse,

464
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,880
but are going to take you on a journey.

465
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,160
They have special attachment.

466
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,640
Extremistraights.com Pope approved.

467
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah, most of them are post sexual, I would say.

468
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
Like there they go beyond our traditional ideas of intercourse.

469
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
I got to say, there's a whole section in there about knee pits,

470
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
about the back of your knee and like things you can do with it that I had.

471
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,720
Absolutely.

472
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
It is a secret cave of pleasure that and you got two of them.

473
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, so I don't think you should set out to to to fail.

474
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm I'm basically kidding about that.

475
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
I do think you should be honest with the guy.

476
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,720
And I don't think and again, this is just.

477
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,840
I don't think anybody would say, well, that's not going to work for me.

478
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
I mean, you're cool at all, but I to amend the statement.

479
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
I think it should be true.

480
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
Love will wait if that's what you want.

481
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
He's not going to say flat out.

482
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,120
Nope, he's going to say no.

483
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay, that's fine.

484
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,480
And then y'all are going to be making out later that same afternoon.

485
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
And it's going to be like, hey, I'm just going to stick it in.

486
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,280
And then you're going to be like, no, I fucking I said no.

487
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,520
I fucking I said it, Jerry.

488
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,080
I said no.

489
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,040
Well, nobody is dating anyone named Jerry.

490
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,400
But oh, that's fair.

491
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,320
That's how it can play out.

492
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,160
They're going to when the lust wave, when you're swimming in the ocean of lust.

493
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,160
And remember, you just heightened this because you just said no, no, no.

494
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
This can't happen because of Jeezy.

495
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,120
Then you Jeezy.

496
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
He is going to.

497
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Combust, so you got to be vigilant when you do when you do this stuff.

498
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
I was just kidding about mouth stuff, by the way, that, you know, it's up to you.

499
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,840
You I think if it's something you're serious about and like this is important to you,

500
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,680
then if he doesn't respect that, if he's like, no, then maybe he's not that great of a dude.

501
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:44,560
Mm hmm. I had a I had a youth pastor once in when I was in in my youth appropriately enough.

502
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,320
And he said, people, you know, you kids ask me all the time, you know, what's

503
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
how far is too far?

504
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,000
You know what?

505
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,400
What?

506
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
You know, what can I still do?

507
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
And I tell him your heavenly father is watching all the time.

508
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,280
So if you wouldn't do it with Jesus in the room, don't do it.

509
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,920
And I sat there thinking that's a pretty fucking short list, man.

510
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Yeah, the list of things I would do if Jesus was in the room.

511
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,760
I wouldn't chew with my mouth open if Jesus was in the room.

512
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,720
Yeah, I do not.

513
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,320
How come Griffin died?

514
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
Oh, he stopped pooping.

515
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
He stopped pooping and he died from it.

516
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,760
I wouldn't put my elbows on the table.

517
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm not going to talk about Frenching.

518
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
Like, no way.

519
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,680
Excuse me.

520
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
Hey, is this cool?

521
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
Is this cool? Hey, J-Man.

522
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,040
I sang at the top of my lungs in my car.

523
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Am I going to hell now?

524
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah.

525
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
Jesus is watching and judging you the whole time.

526
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,760
I mean, I know I was off key, but.

527
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Sorry, bro.

528
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,680
Hey, you know, if this guy turns out to be much more of a dipshit than we gave him credit for,

529
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,600
maybe you'll meet some nice people in your new church that would share your values.

530
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
And that and that might be a better fit.

531
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,720
I don't know. I don't know this guy.

532
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
Again, we're flying kind of blind here.

533
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,240
Well, not to get too preachy, but there is this one concept that I remember from my youth,

534
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,320
and it was that idea of being unequally yoked.

535
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,480
And I think that goes both ways, you know, that if that always be with people that

536
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
raise you up to the standards you want to be raised up to no matter what that is,

537
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
no matter what standards you're holding yourself to.

538
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,880
You know what I mean?

539
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
And that goes to the same of like people that ride in and they're like,

540
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,120
my boyfriend's so lazy, he doesn't have a job, just sits on the couch all day.

541
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,920
I mean, that's bad.

542
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,400
That's bad.

543
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,760
He's bringing you down.

544
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
He's a bad influence on you.

545
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
Yeah, just.

546
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
But that raises the question, what is my wife doing to me?

547
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,560
Like, I don't understand.

548
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,040
Well, after a hard day of her like being an adult and being responsible and taking care of things,

549
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,200
nice to just come home and kick back with you.

550
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,920
She's back with old low-pressure.

551
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,120
Hey, thanks.

552
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,400
Scraps that really.

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,960
Well, I mean, she comes home and she's got no one to impress, you know.

554
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
She hasn't sat down all day.

555
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,680
She wants she wants the human equivalent of of a sumo chair.

556
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,600
Somebody who she wants to put on her sweat pants.

557
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,200
Yeah, you're like a Papa's on.

558
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,960
And yeah, in that respect.

559
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
Now, Travis, who is it?

560
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
She doesn't have to impress.

561
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,200
Do you know?

562
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
And then who is that again for you?

563
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,400
King Nugget.

564
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,880
Thank you.

565
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,720
King Nuggets.

566
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Nugget is adorable.

567
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,680
Or his honorable and most venerable nugs.

568
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,680
Lord High Nugs of Nuggington.

569
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,240
King Nugget sounds like who Mayor McCheese had to overthrow to instill democracy in McDonaldland.

570
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,600
My liege, there's been an uprising.

571
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,120
The fry kids are revolting.

572
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Upturn the vats of honey mustard.

573
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,040
Take my child McRib and get him out of here.

574
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,640
Whisk him to safety.

575
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,560
Return only when there is calm.

576
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,080
Even then momentarily.

577
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,440
Bring me the head of Grimace.

578
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,160
No, my Lord, we don't know where the head starts.

579
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,120
It just kind of slopes.

580
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,560
Having a hard time figuring this out.

581
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,480
Just find a thick part of the gradient.

582
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,880
Someone bring me Lord High Chester McPizza.

583
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,480
He's been gone from our kingdom.

584
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
Advisor fajita, you've served me well these many years.

585
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,120
Now I must send you away to Togglebell safety.

586
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,120
My liege, here comes Kid Vib the Kingslayer.

587
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,000
He's riding wheels like a beautiful chariot.

588
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
The kids club always pays their debts.

589
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,720
Oh, Christ.

590
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,520
Oh, the kids club does always pay their debts.

591
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,440
It is accurate.

592
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,400
You know, speaking of debts, we have our own to pay.

593
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,440
Speaking of debts, we've got to go to the money store.

594
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,880
Hey, Griff, who is this message for?

595
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
This particular message is for Kira Thompson.

596
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
It's from Lance and Georgia Lewis.

597
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,760
Who wish Kira Thompson a happy belated birthday to their MLS holding, max fun bumper sticker

598
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,840
having, sour Broughton making, all around fantastic friend.

599
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,240
Like my bim bam, Kira helps people resolve the pressing issues in their lives as a librarian

600
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,520
that mostly involves directing homeless people to the bathrooms and helping children log

601
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,760
onto computers so they can enjoy porn.

602
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
A noble calling, Kira.

603
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,840
The coolest person ever.

604
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,520
That sounds like a pretty good message.

605
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,520
A noble calling, Kira, the coolest person ever, that sounds like a pretty cool gig.

606
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
Yeah.

607
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Travis, what about our other message?

608
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,240
Wait, what is an MLS, you guys?

609
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,720
It's your masters in literary library sciences.

610
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

611
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Thank you.

612
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Fuck, that might be right.

613
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
I think that is.

614
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Isn't that terrifying?

615
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Travis, who's the other message for?

616
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,240
Oh, it's for Lori Yokoyama, and it's from Jonah Yokoyama.

617
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Man, those are good names.

618
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Yeah, right?

619
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
And didn't I do a great job pronouncing them?

620
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
You did.

621
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
You did.

622
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Really good.

623
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Good job, Travis.

624
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Well, the thing is, I've met Lori and Jonah.

625
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,480
They came to see me in Complete Works, and Lori made some of the most amazing cupcakes

626
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
I've ever had in my entire life.

627
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,600
Are they the... I had cookies once.

628
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Good.

629
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I think the people who brought cookies since...

630
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Congrats.

631
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
You smell great, sweetie.

632
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Good job.

633
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Have you guys heard of cookies?

634
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Fuck, they're good.

635
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
They're like flat cupcakes.

636
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
They're really yummy.

637
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:56,480
They're like crackers, but like sugar crackers.

638
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Mm-hmm.

639
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Mm-hmm.

640
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Anyway.

641
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,160
So, Jonah says, happy 120, Lori, maker of literally the most awesome cupcakes Travis

642
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,800
McElroy has ever eaten, confirmed.

643
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,460
Happy anniversary, eight years, and I love you more all the time.

644
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,560
Thanks for being so supremely awesome and wonderful.

645
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,760
I'm lucky to have you in my life.

646
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,400
And then Jonah has informed us here to make a fart sound.

647
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
There.

648
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm not going to... There's no way.

649
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Eager to please.

650
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,840
There is absolutely no way-

651
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Happy to be here.

652
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,840
... that I'm ever going to... I did it with my knee pit.

653
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,680
Those goons are better than Beverly Hills 2 all but 3.

654
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
They probably quite literally are.

655
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,160
I also want to talk to you guys who mentioned them earlier, but ExtremeRestraints.com is

656
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,360
a site where you can buy all your adult toys for adults only.

657
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,920
We have this coupon code, MIDDLIST, and it does two things for you.

658
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,320
One, it saves you 20% on all your adult purchases, which is rad.

659
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:08,200
But more importantly, it puts your purchase on a big list of purchases by MBMBAMFITS.

660
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,560
An anonymous list.

661
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
We should point out.

662
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
An anonymous list.

663
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
We have no names or anything.

664
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,880
We have this list of things people have bought that, wow, some of you guys, you dug deep.

665
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
You're getting it.

666
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,440
You are getting it.

667
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:29,040
We got a beaded silk rope, the Climax Gems vibrator, and a Scarlett Overload beaded anal

668
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
plug.

669
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
That's one order.

670
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I mean, that's-

671
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,240
What do you think the Superhead honcho is?

672
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,620
I don't know, but lots of people seem to be getting into that right now.

673
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,760
What about Sammy's Fist anal plug?

674
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

675
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,680
Butterfly lace tanga panty.

676
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
That sounds nice.

677
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,000
That sounds like a nice place to start.

678
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,740
How about latex briefs with a penis sleeve?

679
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:56,360
That's good because sometimes my penis gets so cold.

680
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,600
Just for this warm, you know, winter is coming.

681
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Winter is coming.

682
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Put your dick in this sleeve.

683
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,760
Now, I know, I think I have a basic idea of what this thing is, but the name makes it

684
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
sound real fun.

685
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,600
The double balloon enema nozzle.

686
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Yay!

687
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Yay!

688
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Get it!

689
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,960
The double balloon of fluid just will not do.

690
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Yep.

691
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,280
Uh, this is very great.

692
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
This is great.

693
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,320
Trinity Contempo rabbit vibrator, and four AAA alkaline batteries.

694
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,080
So hey, it's your one stop shop.

695
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Is this person preparing to orgasm through the apocalypse?

696
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,120
Case of water.

697
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,560
Somebody bought a three in one sun touched candle.

698
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,960
Which I assume they just lit and then ran jammed right up their butthole.

699
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,880
I don't know what you do with this.

700
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,720
But anyway, that's ExtremeRestraints.com.

701
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720

I think they are our leading sponsor, which literally makes me so happy every time.

710

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
That'll make them real happy.

717
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Yeah.

718
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
Yeah, they'll like that.

719
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Hey.

720
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
How about a Yahoo answer?

721
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
I'm wanting one of those.

722
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
So bad.

723
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
This one was sent in by Seth Condon.

724
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Thanks, Seth.

725
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

726
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,120
Oh, it's just a colon.

727
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
OK.

728
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Easy enough.

729
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,280
Is it a picture of a colon?

730
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Because that sounds more like Yahoo Answers.

731
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,680
I think that emoticon is like you've got the eyes, but the mouth is sewn shut.

732
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
That's horrifying.

733
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,620
They ask, what Pokemon should we name our baby after?

734
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,200
Me and my husband are so excited for our new baby.

735
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,800
We really love the first 151 Pokemon and are planning to name her him after a Pokemon.

736
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,240
We have some preliminary names picked out, but are having a tough time deciding.

737
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,080
What do you guys think of these names?

738
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,040
And then they list some Pokemon names, including Psyduck, and Caterpie, and Raichu.

739
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Is Ghastly in there?

740
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Ekans.

741
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Ghastly.

742
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Ghastly.

743
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,720
Ghastly is not among them.

744
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,400
I appreciate these people's attempt to keep it OG by not introducing the other ones, because

745
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,680
I feel like they really lost their shit for the naming conventions for 152 on.

746
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,920
Yeah, so we're keeping a ridge.

747
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,520
We're keeping Gin 1, Red, Blue, or LeafGreen, FireRed.

748
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,720
Okay, so my vote goes to Slowbro.

749
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,280
Is there any particular reason?

750
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,720
Because I feel like you're setting that kid up to fucking fail.

751
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,120
Well, I thought we were already planning on that.

752
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
I thought that was already a super plan.

753
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Oh, I see.

754
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
You're leading into it.

755
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,560
Yeah, I'm just going with it.

756
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:08,960
I think that my choice would have to be for Stunky.

757
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Stunky the Pokemon.

758
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,240
Is Stunky a Pokemon?

759
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,200
Yeah, and it looks exactly like it sounds.

760
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,280
So actually, okay, I'm going to pick a real one.

761
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,920
Because Justin, I do not want to put you on blast, but that is definitely not an original

762
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Pokedex.

763
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,280
Okay, I'm sorry Griffin.

764
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,680
How about I go with, I'll go with one from the original 151 and go with Spinarak.

765
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
That'll be good.

766
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Yeah, that's good.

767
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Spinarak.

768
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,020
Spinarak is from- Yeah, because your child's going to be an

769
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
evil mage.

770
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,200
Wait, so Griffin is Spinarak?

771
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,760
Of course not.

772
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,480
Sorry, why?

773
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,200
Because it's in the second, it's in the gold silver crystal generation, Justin.

774
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
You know this?

775
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Obviously you know this.

776
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,760
What about- I feel like you're just doing this to piss

777
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
me off now.

778
00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:00,400
Okay, I'm going to have to go with, can I use Japanese names?

779
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,200
I think you have to.

780
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,920
Okay, then I'm going to go with Nidoqueen.

781
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,640
Okay, that's not a Japanese name, that's a real-

782
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,400
Sorry Griffin, what?

783
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
That's what it was called.

784
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Okay.

785
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,080
You make me so fucking angry.

786
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,040
All I want out of you is a straight answer.

787
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Fushigi Banner.

788
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Okay.

789
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,840
Fushigi Banner is Venusaur in Japan.

790
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,120
I like that way, way better.

791
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm going to go with Mr. Mime.

792
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,840
Because it's good, you are saying a lot about that kid.

793
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Right from the jump.

794
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,880
Hey, by the way, there are, I'm going to say, I didn't count them, but I'll say about 25

795
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,680
answers to this, and all of them are composed of Pokemon names, and not please for not doing

796
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,760
this thing, not doing this terrible, terrible thing to a human being.

797
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,600
Not cries for mercy, please to the governor to spare this child.

798
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,120
Here's the thing, but this is what blows my mind whenever we stumble upon the Yahoos

799
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,480
that are like, I want to name my kid after Harry Potter people.

800
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,080
There are real-ass regular normal names somewhere in the Pokeverse.

801
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,600
Yeah, sure, like Charizard.

802
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,560
No, name your kid, I'm saying name your kid fucking Ash, name him Brock, name her Misty.

803
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,960
No, don't, why would you pick, why would you say like, no, those are real bullshit names.

804
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,560
I'm going with Pikachu, like fuck you.

805
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,800
Everybody wants to be the person that does the thing that no one else has done before.

806
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,440
And I think that you have, I think if you name your kid, you know, Ponyta, I think you're

807
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,120
probably in the clear, as far as that is concerned.

808
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,440
Let's be honest though, I mean, our worry is that you, you know, this kid will become

809
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,320
a social outcast because he's named after a goddamn Pokemon, but consider this kid's

810
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,360
parents.

811
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
The dais cast.

812
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,320
I mean, I don't think that this guy's going to be the head of the lacrosse team.

813
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,960
No, and he's going to feel, there's going to be a lot of psychological issues, you know,

814
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,480
vis-a-vis having 150 siblings.

815
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,440
Yeah, because they got to pop them all out, right?

816
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Got to birth them all.

817
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Got to birth them all.

818
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,280
I got to say though, I did just picture like the idea of this child growing up to just

819
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
be an incredibly successful lawyer.

820
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,680
I think you mean evolving into an incredibly successful lawyer.

821
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,880
Evolving into a successful lawyer and someone just be like, now Geodude Johnson, attorney

822
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,400
of law, are there criminals out there affecting you?

823
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Don't worry.

824
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I'll catch them all.

825
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,640
Professional football player, Charizard Jones.

826
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,520
Oh, I got Charizard Jones on my fantasy team.

827
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Oh, that rules.

828
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
That would be great.

829
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,960
Yeah, that would actually be the best.

830
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,320
Wiggly tough Peterson, I find you guilty of four counts of patricide.

831
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,080
You killed your parents, resurrected them, and then killed them again.

832
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,960
What a terrible crime, but who can blame you?

833
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
You're off scot-free.

834
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,920
Vote for me, May Champ Smith.

835
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,680
President May Champ, what have you done?

836
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,040
You have run our country into the ground.

837
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,960
Are you really better off than you were four years ago when President Pidgeotto was elected?

838
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,360
Can we have a new weekly segment on the show called Justin Tries to Pronounce Pokemon Names?

839
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,040
I did great.

840
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,240
I should have gone with Butterfree.

841
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
That's my bad.

842
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:41,080
Or, you know, I should have gone with Floppy, is that how that's pronounced?

843
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Mareep?

844
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,040
Mareep is a pretty good name.

845
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,640
That would be a great pick for them.

846
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,320
Dr. B-Drill Murphy, O-B-G-Y-N.

847
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,440
Yeah, let me get up in there, much like a drill would do on a bee's hand.

848
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,600
Can we move on?

849
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
I have a question here.

850
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,220
Hey, brothers.

851
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,160
I've been a tattoo artist for seven years, and one of the hardest parts of my job is

852
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,340
gently informing potential clients that getting their girlfriend or boyfriend's name tattooed

853
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,600
on them is a terrible idea.

854
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,980
Can you help me come up with some good ways to let them know they're being dumb?

855
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,640
That's from bringing the pain in Maine.

856
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,960
I have an idea.

857
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,120
You know when you go to a tattoo parlor, or for those of you that have never been to a

858
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,600
tattoo parlor, they have books up front that is a catalog of the artist's work so that

859
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,400
you can be like, oh, I really like this idea and I like this aesthetic.

860
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,560
And there's always a section where it's cover ups.

861
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,400
What if you had a book that was just cover ups, where someone got a boyfriend or girlfriend's

862
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,280
name tattooed and then got it covered up by something?

863
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, have them go ahead and pick out which cover up they want.

864
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,320
And make that part of the deal where they gotta sign a contract that says they'll come

865
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
back to you.

866
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
It's like a tattoo prenup.

867
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I like that.

868
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
Yes.

869
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,800
Yeah, you gotta prepay for your cover up.

870
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,360
So you get Jennifer tattooed on you with the option of, if it doesn't work out, you get

871
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,440
it augmented to say, whatever happened to Jennifer Grey?

872
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,240
You get it augmented to Bennifer because you were just such a huge fan of Bennifer and

873
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Jennifer Garner.

874
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Yeah.

875
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,520
Now how do you cover up your Bennifer tattoo when that falls apart?

876
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Because I got that.

877
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
I would like to know.

878
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,200
Well no, in that scenario you're covered because he went from Lopez to Garner.

879
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm saying as long as he keeps seeing Jennifer as you are, you are in the clear.

880
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,040
I gotta say, and maybe there's this sort of different ethics that I'm not aware of in

881
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:51,560
the tattooing biz, but I gotta say, man, just fucking do the tattoo.

882
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,680
The only knowledge that you could be imparting to them is that it is permanent.

883
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,680
And if they are not aware of that, then...

884
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,200
You don't think that there's a certain amount of inherent responsibility?

885
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,040
That's different from going and getting a haircut because someone said, dye my hair

886
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,440
and shave my basketball number into my face or something.

887
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,520
And you're like, okay, cool.

888
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,960
And then that will grow out and that will go away.

889
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,240
But if someone comes into you and says, I want this terrible idea for a tattoo.

890
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,040
I don't want to live in a tattoo in any state.

891
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,040
But it's...

892
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,840
If I want to get a stupid tattoo, then I should be allowed to.

893
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,440
They have to practice a regimen of stern non-malfeasance.

894
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,060
They adhere to the Hippocratic Oath, just like every other medical professional.

895
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:44,400
And that means they can't put a race car with Miley Cyrus's face on it on somebody's body

896
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,080
as a joke, or maybe for serious.

897
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,480
Are you saying that they can't do that instead of what the person asked for?

898
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,960
Or can you not just say, I don't think that's a good idea?

899
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,400
Or is that like, well, fuck you?

900
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,720
I think they can turn people away, right?

901
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,160
I'm sure you can turn...

902
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,280
No one's ever gotten a tattoo at gunpoint, I think.

903
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,360
No, but they can turn people away for being drunk.

904
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,400
I think that this is along the same lines.

905
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
You say you're drunk.

906
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
You're drunk.

907
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
You're drunk.

908
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
You're drunk.

909
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Get out of here.

910
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
I'll make you a deal.

911
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,560
If you still want this in a year, I'll do it for you.

912
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:25,160
But then they're just going to go to the rusty needles or whatever the bad tattoo parlor

913
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
is.

914
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,240
They're going to get an alleyway tattoo from a person who doesn't know what they're doing,

915
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,960
and then they're serious.

916
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,480
They don't give a shit about the Hippocratic Oath in the alley.

917
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,960
You could give them a tattoo of blood.

918
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,240
Oh, that's a good idea, Trav.

919
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
I like that.

920
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Get them a tattoo of what?

921
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
A blood tattoo.

922
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
A tattoo of blood.

923
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,440
They hurt a lot more because there's no ink, but you can, by doing the...

924
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,240
You know, you can get a tattoo with no ink, and it'll just stitch your blood in there.

925
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,440
It's not permanent.

926
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
It will heal, but maybe see how that goes.

927
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,760
So are we just talking about cutting a thing into you, and then it's a scar?

928
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Well, yeah.

929
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
I mean, yes.

930
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Yes and no.

931
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,120
So last year, when I reached into the oven to get a pizza out, and I burned my forearm

932
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:16,160
on the rack, that was just me getting a bitch in blood tattoo.

933
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
That was a pizza brand.

934
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Okay.

935
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
You got branded by your love of pizza.

936
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Oh, shit.

937
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,860
Guys, I just remembered I got some pizza.

938
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,180
It's right across my wrist.

939
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,840
It looks like I tried to shuffle myself off this mortal coil, and really what happened

940
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,920
was that I had a tombstone in there, and I just really couldn't wait to get at it.

941
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Is tombstone pizza...

942
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
You had to earn it.

943
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,240
I had a tombstone pizza from 1997 that I've been saving.

944
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:51,200
You know, every pizza has a story, but only Griffin's pizza has a legend.

945
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,160
You understand that tombstone pizza was a pizza company.

946
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,720
This was not a promotional pizza for the movie Tombstone.

947
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,080
I feel like it was.

948
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,820
All the pepperonis shaped like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday cheese.

949
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,040
This has gotten out of control.

950
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
Yeah.

951
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,640
Well, yeah, usually how a bitch shakes out.

952
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,440
Hey, I recently found out two of my cousins started following me on Twitter.

953
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,700
This wouldn't be an issue, except I'm 30 and they're 14 and 11.

954
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,320
It's not like I'm shoveling hate and filth in my tweets, but I'm a grown ass lady woman

955
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,040
with a grown ass lady woman thoughts and opinions.

956
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,040
What should I do?

957
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,040
Be uncool and block them or censor myself in hopes that I don't corrupt young minds?

958
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,220
That's from not sure what to do in Chicago.

959
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,480
This is great.

960
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,520
We all had to deal with this.

961
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,240
Yes.

962
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:53,080
I feel like Twitter is the truest form of who you are.

963
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
That's not true.

964
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,080
No.

965
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:03,120
I say fuck a bunch on Twitter and my fairly religious cousins listen or follow the tweets

966
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
I say.

967
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,080
I can't help but feel... You just got to stomach the disappointment every time you

968
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
say anything.

969
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Yeah.

970
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,720
You know what is funny about that, Griffin?

971
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:19,400
I had that problem too, but I recently checked in and the situation had resolved itself.

972
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,400
They stopped following you?

973
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
They stopped following you.

974
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
They did unfollow the kid.

975
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Yes.

976
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,680
That is really too bad.

977
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,440
I have been unfollowed and I can't... I don't think I can follow a 15 year old without it

978
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
being mutual.

979
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,160
I had to unfollow them reciprocally, reciprocably, reciprocably.

980
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Got it.

981
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
Yeah.

982
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,160
Got it in one.

983
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,280
One take J they call me.

984
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:55,960
I had this experience yesterday where I was at work and this 15 year old said, hey, I

985
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,560
really liked your show.

986
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,480
Me thinking it was one of the many plays that I have worked on, I said, oh, which one?

987
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,160
He said, my brother, my brother and me and my response was, oh.

988
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Oh, fuck.

989
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,160
Sorry.

990
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,520
Sorry for saying fuck just then too.

991
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
You should go.

992
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,240
You should... Can you leave?

993
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,360
You got to find... What you got to do is find the balance that works for you so that

994
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,360
you can sleep at night.

995
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,960
For instance, I stopped saying the C word on Twitter.

996
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
That's good.

997
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,640
That was a good place to start.

998
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,440
I do have a secret special other Twitter feed where I really just let it all hang out.

999
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,440
See, because every time Griffin censors a word, that word doesn't go away.

1000
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Oh, no.

1001
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Right.

1002
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,760
You got to put it somewhere or you get a backlog of words.

1003
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,560
I can't keep carving them into my body.

1004
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,200
I got to find a healthier venue for them.

1005
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,760
You mean giving yourself a tattoo of blood.

1006
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
That's what you're doing.

1008
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Yeah.

1009
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,740
My body is just covered in blood tattoos of the C word.

1010
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,640
We didn't make that concept up.

1011
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
I want to make that clear.

1012
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
No.

1013
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,640
It was in one of Penn and Teller's books.

1014
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
Yeah.

1015
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,640
I think it was the travel book.

1016
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
Yeah.

1017
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
It's a school to read song.

1018
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,120
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Nicole B. Thompson.

1019
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,120
Thanks, Nicole.

1020
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,640
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Dina, who asks, what's Fifty Shades of Grey about?

1021
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,000
A reading teacher's favorite book in my school is Fifty Shades of Grey, and I heard it's

1022
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,060
like porn, but in words.

1023
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,080
Can someone tell me what happens in the book?

1024
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Yeah.

1025
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,400
I'll try to wrap it up for you.

1026
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,120
See, there's a rich businessman whose name is Christian Grey.

1027
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Have you read the book?

1028
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
No.

1029
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
Okay.

1030
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,400
There's a young lady named, let's say Darlene.

1031
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Okay.

1032
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400
Okay.

1033
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Christian Grey is this rich businessman.

1034
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Darlene, I'm going to fuck you so good.

1035
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,400
That's not what he says.

1036
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:49,400
He says, Darlene, I'm going to spank you, and Darlene's like, oh, Christopher, please

1037
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
spank me.

1038
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,960
At first, I think she's more, I think she's like, I don't know if it's going to feel

1039
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
good.

1040
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Yeah.

1041
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
At first, she's like, you're right.

1042
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,960
At first, she's like, I don't know if I like to get spanked.

1043
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
I don't know.

1044
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,960
I don't want my fanny to get reddened.

1045
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,240
And then Christian's like- Is she a ghost?

1046
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
She is a ghost.

1047
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
In the book, she's a ghost.

1048
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,080
So Christian Grey's like, well, I'm sorry, Darlene, but I'm going to try spanking you

1049
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,080
anyway.

1050
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,080
So Christian is melting.

1051
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Mm-hmm.

1052
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Yes.

1053
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,280
I'm trying to follow along here.

1054
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Yeah.

1055
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,280
Keep up.

1056
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Christian is melting.

1057
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
Darlene is a ghost.

1058
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Okay.

1059
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:28,600
And he takes her over her knee, and he said, get ready for the spank, spank, spank.

1060
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Wait.

1061
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
I'm confused.

1062
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,600
The spanking cushioner is coming into town.

1063
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
I was trying to think of something better to spank a cushioner.

1064
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,600
So Christian Grey is the pallbearer.

1065
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Yes.

1066
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:46,600
So Christian Grey, who you may know better as Undertaker manager, pallbearer, says, oh,

1067
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,600
yeah, it's time to spank you.

1068
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Uh-huh.

1069
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,600
I got a hankering for spanking.

1070
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,600
I'm going to give it to you.

1071
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,600
And he's also selling children's cereal.

1072
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
I'm going to give it to you.

1073
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
So good.

1074
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,600
And Darlene's like, I still don't know.

1075
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,600
But then, flak.

1076
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Gives her the first.

1077
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,600
His hand actually passes through her, her spectral form.

1078
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Yeah.

1079
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
And that gives him.

1080
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
He loves it.

1081
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Gives him a button.

1082
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Now, did he buy his riding crop on ExtremeMachines.com?

1083
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
You bet he did.

1084
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,600
Or use the coupon code MEDALIS.

1085
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,600
So he spanks her, and that's like the next 200 pages.

1086
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Or is it just one spank that just reverberates through her body?

1087
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,600
And then she describes it in much detail.

1088
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,600
I felt my ectoplasm shudder through my body.

1089
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,600
It was as though he were spanking my very soul.

1090
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,600
As his melting pallbearer-esque hand slipped through my spectral form.

1091
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,600
I felt myself begin to slimer.

1092
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,600
And then I slimered and slimered and slimered.

1093
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
And there's 30 pages of that.

1094
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I slimered and slimered over and over again.

1095
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,600
And then Ernie Hudson showed up and sent me back.

1096
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,600
And made me watch Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3 and said, watch this scene I'm in.

1097
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
It's real good.

1098
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,600
You're going to love this scene.

1099
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,600
Travis, you're in the second book now.

1100
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
You've moved on to the second.

1101
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Oh, sorry.

1102
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
Sorry.

1103
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,600
I think that here's an opportunity for us.

1104
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,600
If we could somehow create what Fifty Shades of Grey has done to books.

1105
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
By which I mean ruined them forever.

1106
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:35,600
I think we have a great chance to really seize the podcast market share here.

1107
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Yeah, if we could ruin podcasts like we haven't done that already.

1108
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
I don't know how we could be more erotic than we're already being.

1109
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
That's a good point.

1110
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,600
We could have a secret alternate podcast stream.

1111
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Where we talk about just like sex stuff and like really, I guess that's this.

1112
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Never mind.

1113
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Thanks for listening.

1114
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,600
Yeah, I mean it's basically, this is basically the Fifty Shades of Grey.

1115
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Just people don't like it as much.

1116
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Maybe we need to do an alternate podcast where we don't do any of that.

1117
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
And it's appropriate for our cousins to listen to.

1118
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,600
And that will make this one seem more like Shades of Grey in comparison.

1119
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
That's good.

1120
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
We'll just call that one like green.

1121
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:19,600
I have some hit lines for Fifty Shades of Grey.

1122
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
If you guys just want to try these on.

1123
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Okay.

1124
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
We could try to put these in the podcast.

1125
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Oh, good.

1126
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
This is going to be.

1127
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Okay.

1128
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
I'd like to bite that lip.

1129
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,600
He whispers darkly, geez, I'm a quivering moist mess and he hasn't even touched me.

1130
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,600
I squirm in my seat and I meet this dark glare.

1131
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
Fuck.

1132
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,600
The muscles inside the deepest darkest part of me clenching the most delicious fashion.

1133
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Where is it not dark in your body?

1134
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,600
There is no light in it.

1135
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Go on, Travis.

1136
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Suck me, baby.

1137
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,600
His thumb presses on my tongue and my mouth closes around him, sucking wildly.

1138
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Holy fuck.

1139
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,600
This is wrong, but holy hell is it erotic.

1140
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
This is the dirtiest.

1141
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,600
This is we have done a podcast where we talked about eating celebrity poop and fucking fowls.

1142
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,600
And this is the grossest thing I've ever read.

1143
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,600
I don't like that holy fuck is a standalone sentence.

1144
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,600
I only want period.

1145
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Do one more.

1146
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Oh, my, I didn't think it would feel like this.

1147
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Didn't know it could feel as good as this.

1148
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,600
My thoughts are scattering like ectoplasm.

1149
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,600
There's only sensation.

1150
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Only him.

1151
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Only me.

1152
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
On, please.

1153
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
I stiffen.

1154
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,600
This is terrible.

1155
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,600
This is bad.

1156
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
This is badly.

1157
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,600
I want to say that this is proof that he is melting because the next one is Christian

1158
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:57,600
follows with two sharp thrusts and he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release.

1159
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
Where'd you go?

1160
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Ah, fuck.

1161
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,600
My insides practically contort with potent, meaty liquid desire.

1162
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Guys, it's turning.

1163
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
She has diarrhea.

1164
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
So she basically has.

1165
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Guys, it's turning from from being a goof to like being genuinely erotic.

1166
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,600
We need to be careful.

1167
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,600
We're walking on thin, thin, sexy ice.

1168
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:26,600
I was I was at books a million last weekend and I was checking out and the the woman in

1169
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:33,600
front of me is buying one book and as the cashier is putting it in the bag, he says,

1170
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,600
you know, a lot of people are reading that Fifty Shades of Grey just like that.

1171
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,600
And I think this dude legit did not know what the book is.

1172
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Oh, or maybe he's just putting her on blast.

1173
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
You think he's blown up her spot?

1174
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,600
I think.

1175
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,600
I don't know.

1176
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,600
Although they're a shame.

1177
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
They are a shameless bunch.

1178
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
The fans of this book.

1179
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,600
I was sat on an airplane while a woman read it right next to me.

1180
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
She was reading it.

1181
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
She was reading about people just getting slammed, jammed and ram jammed.

1182
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,600
And she was she was thwibbing it right there.

1183
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,600
She's just flicking her beans.

1184
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,600
She was just thwibbing, thwibbing her acorn for all to see.

1185
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Oh, man.

1186
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
Fifty Shades of Black.

1187
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
All right.

1188
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
Well, nobody listen wants to listen to this podcast anymore.

1189
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
I say we put up put it.

1190
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,600
We could reveal our fucking pin numbers and all of our Internet passwords right now and

1191
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,600
we would be a OK.

1192
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Here's where I buried all the jobs.

1193
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,600
No one's going to find them because no one's listening.

1194
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Not that anyone's listening, but this has been my brother, my brother, me.

1195
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
It's a comedy podcast we put out every Monday.

1196
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,600
If you're looking for something else to listen to on Mondays, I put out another show called

1197
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
Satellite Dish with my wife, Sydney.

1198
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,600
It's a podcast about TV.

1199
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,600
You can find that on iTunes and it comes out Mondays.

1200
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,600
It's part of what I'm calling the McElroy Fun Squad Monday.

1201
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
I infrequently.

1202
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
Sorry.

1203
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,600
I infrequently produce a podcast called In Case of Emergency.

1204
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
So you should check that out.

1205
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,600
But more importantly, if you're in the Cincinnati area or really anywhere around us coming up

1206
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:11,600
in October, I'm going to be in a steampunk version of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus

1207
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,600
at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company.

1208
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
So come down and check it out.

1209
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
It's going to be awesome.

1210
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Travis plays a robot.

1211
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,600
You can follow me.

1212
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,600
How about I don't have a podcast or show, but I'm on Twitter.

1213
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,600
It's Griffin McElroy on Twitter.

1214
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,600
I'm so close to 10,000 followers.

1215
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,600
For me, that is the celebrity hump.

1216
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,600
Once you get in five digits, you're there.

1217
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,600
You've made it.

1218
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,600
This is what I've learned from the Twitter follow account, Griffin.

1219
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,600
Justin is everybody's favorite because he has the most.

1220
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,600
And then you are the second favorite because you have the second most.

1221
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,600
And then the show itself is everyone's third favorite.

1222
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
And coming up last, it's me.

1223
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,600
So there are 2,000 people that like the show, but not me.

1224
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Well, not big on Travis.

1225
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
They're not big Travis fans.

1226
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,600
To be fair, your tweets are, I'd say they leave a little bit to be desired.

1227
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,600
My tweets are delightful.

1228
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Let's go through the list.

1229
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
Let's see.

1230
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
I ate a big ham this morning.

1231
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,600
And I've never said that.

1232
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,600
Watching Avatar The Last Airbender again.

1233
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,600
I just can't get enough mayonnaise.

1234
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
I detest mayonnaise, sir.

1235
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:28,600
But thank you to people who have downloaded the show, subscribed on iTunes, and reviewed it.

1236
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,600
That really means a lot and helps to boost us up there.

1237
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,600
So if you're looking for a way to say thank you, that would be a great way to do it.

1238
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Say it with roses.

1239
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Travis, how many Geena Davis retweets have you done in the past month?

1240
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,600
All of them.

1241
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:50,600
Following Travis is like following Geena Davis twice.

1242
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,600
Well, that's because if you ever see Janet and Geena Davis, I'm right behind them.

1243
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,600
You retweet her tweet, and then you tweet at her, good one, Geena.

1244
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,600
You did it again, Gene.

1245
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,600
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1246
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,600
into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1247
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,600
It was John Roderick's birthday last week.

1248
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
Happy belated birthday, John Roderick.

1249
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
I only know that because people talked about it on Twitter.

1250
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,600
I'm not like a stalker or anything like that.

1251
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,600
Oh, God, I just want to smell his hair.

1252
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

1253
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,600
We've got t-shirts and stuff, MaxFunStore.com if you want that.

1254
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,600
And there's other shows on the Maximum Fun Network.

1255
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,600
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org.

1256
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
They're all great.

1257
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,600
And we haven't mentioned it in a while, but we got a couple people asking this week,

1258
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,600
if you are interested in doing a Jumbotron or you have a personal message or a business message or anything like that,

1259
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,600
just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron and all the information is there.

1260
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,600
Oh, oh, oh, before I forget, we've had a lot of people asking about this, too.

1261
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:01,600
If you'd like the first 30 or so episodes of the show that are not on the Maximum Fun Network,

1262
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,600
you can find all those at MBMBAM.Libson.com.

1263
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,600
Just click through the archives there.

1264
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,600
And on the right side, you can see all the years we've been doing the show.

1265
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,600
The first one is in April of 2010.

1266
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,600
You can see the hit art that I made for it before Justin Russo did it.

1267
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,600
And it's just a picture of the three of us on Mars near an ocean, and we all have mustaches.

1268
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,600
And it's not very good art, but it has a special place in my heart.

1269
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:38,600
That was back when we were using a theme song from, let's call them a very litigious Swedish pop group.

1270
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Yeah, so you can go back to all the old episodes that are there for your enjoyment.

1271
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Thanks for the years.

1272
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,600
Thanks for being with us and enjoying us.

1273
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
This is episode 120.

1274
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,600
We're going to be back next week with 121.

1275
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,600
That seems like a lot. That seems like a pretty big...

1276
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,600
It seems like we're coming to the end.

1277
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,600
Yeah, when do we get to stop?

1278
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Never.

1279
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,600
I pledge to the listeners of this podcast that we will never stop doing it until one of us dies.

1280
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
How's that?

1281
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
That seems...

1282
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
And then there will be a very touching slideshow.

1283
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,600
Or until we stop making money off of it, because...

1284
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Yeah.

1285
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,600
Until we stop making money off of it, that's really going to be...

1286
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,600
As soon as that sweet money well dries up, we're going to dip.

1287
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:24,600
I think that there's always going to be a market, though, for people to pay us to make fun of George Lopez for them.

1288
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Take care of my legwork, my brother, my brother, me.

1289
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,600
So you don't have to.

1290
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,600
So anyway, in closing, Griffin's going to ask us one more question.

1291
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,600
This final Yahoo was sent in by Gray. Thanks, Gray.

1292
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:43,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monolithic Vulgarity, who asks,

1293
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,600
Does anyone have a recording of a duck having an orgasm?

1294
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,600
I am Justin McElroy.

1295
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

1296
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I am Ernie Hudson.

1297
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,600
This has been my brother, my brother, and may it kiss your dad.

1298
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:26,600
And we're on the web.
