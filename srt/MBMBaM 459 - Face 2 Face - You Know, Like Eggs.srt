1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,040
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:56,160
oldest brother Justin McElroy. Hey, we're Q. Are the house lights on? Because it seems like I could

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,080
sit. There we go. Little distracting. I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,880
It actually hurts a little bit. Like, it's so loud, it's like being next to a jet engine.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,360
These facilities are built to make sure the sound is great, going from the violins and shit

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,440
to you, and they don't really count on people to be like, help, yeah, fuck yeah.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Madden butterflies my shit. This is an advice show. We have been in your beautiful city for all

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,880
seven hours. We flew in, and it is astounding. I think it's the right word.

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,720
Beautiful. The vistas. It looks like you are in a fairy village nestled inside of a remote

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,080
mountain kingdom. It was like flying into the shire. Yeah, and then. I said in the van ride

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,480
from the airport to the hotel, and it fucking slayed, so I'm really excited I dropped this on

18
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:19,280
you. Hey, more like Salt Lake pretty. Yeah, very good. Thanks. So I'm like blown away

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,880
driving through your amazing city, blown away at these vistas, and then I walked a half mile

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:34,560
to get four percent beer, and are you all okay? Because you can tell us if you're not okay.

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Everyone blink twice if you're not okay. You can come with us. There's room in the car.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,680
I hate to be the one to break it to y'all, but there's stronger beer other places.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
I think that maybe it's not a great fit because yesterday. Wouldn't you love to be

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,960
partying with someone who's traveled in from Salt Lake City? They're like,

25
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:07,040
oh, what's wrong with you? I had two beers. Losing it. We were trying to figure out what to do. We

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,080
have some time to spend tomorrow in your beautiful city, and I was like, there's the big cottonwood

27
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,880
cannon looks really, did I say cannon? It looks sweet. It looks like great hiking, and I was

28
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,440
saying that out loud, not realizing just what a tough sell that was going to be for the McElroy

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,520
family. I was looking at it like, and you just walk up it. Keeping in mind that this is like

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,920
when we're looking for a restaurant, if it took a 10 minute walk, we're like, oh, I don't know.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,400
I don't know. Maybe we should rub hub it. Justin literally said, do you, is there like a store to

32
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,280
buy something when you get there? We're all having a lot of fun. It was a good time. It's a good

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:00,000
place. Thank you for having us. Thank you for the warm reception. Holy crap. Would you all like to,

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,040
oh, we're going to do some of our twisted skewed jokes up here for a bit, and then we're going to

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,880
do audience questions that you all have sent in ahead of time. Thank you all so much for doing

36
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,320
that. It may be kind of tricky because this is just a big square of humans. The whole audience

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,360
is one solid person. Yes. But again, if you come to see Lobo M, you're not like halfway through

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
like, ah, I've fucking seen this before. I'm out. You're also not like, I'm going to ask them how

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,720
it's going to end. I'm going to make a sneaky exit. Yeah. So anyway, it's an advice show. Yes,

40
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,440
but I'd like to open with a yahoo from the yahoo answers. Okay. Riddle me piss. Okay.

41
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay. So unprecedented, unprecedented. I've now been interrupted doing a yahoo from both brothers

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,960
now for their great segments. And it's really, you're starting with this. All right. This one

43
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:14,400
not from riddles.com, but from riddles.fyi. Okay. Now this is a real brain teaser. Yeah.

44
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,840
I love him. I love his great voice and how long he makes it last.

45
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,320
Look how the riddle master has devolved into Minnie Ripperson. I'm really enjoying that.

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:34,400
What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk. And eyes, but cannot see.

47
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,040
A potato. The last part is a potato.

48
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,960
The last is a potato. Would you like to hear it one more time?

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:55,600
Not really. What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk.

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
I legit think I know the answer. And eyes, but cannot see. Griffin.

51
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm going to say a penguin, a chair, and a potato.

52
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
What was the last one? Eyes, but cannot see.

53
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
And the first one was wings, but cannot fly. Is it a buffalo, wild wings?

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,160
A good guess. But no, I will read it to you one more time.

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,640
I would also like you to remember that on riddles.fyi, you can see how many times someone

56
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,880
shared it. So remember five different people at least looked at this and said,

57
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,720
oh hell yeah, I'm going to share that. I imagine it's about to go up precipitously.

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880
What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk.

59
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
And eyes, but cannot see. A dead bird.

60
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,960
It's rough. He's not wrong.

61
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,480
I didn't write it. Although I do think it opens up a whole new realm of riddle of like,

62
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,840
what looks like a dog, but can't bark? A dead dog.

63
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah, sure. Good. Good.

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham.

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,240
It is Yahoo Answers user. The internet doesn't work on the stage.

66
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,160
So I'm going to say a Bilbo asks,

67
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
is a restaurant a store?

68
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,240
Technically speaking. Update. Okay. Well, to clear things up,

69
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
whenever my family is going to Olive Garden, we say, I'm going to the store.

70
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Why on earth? To who?

71
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,880
Well, I said this the other day and my friend looked at me weird when I said that I was excited

72
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,080
to eat the breadsticks. I think that technically a restaurant, because they have stock,

73
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,560
parentheses, food, and you give them money, parentheses, dollars.

74
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,080
Oh, I see.

75
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Not coal mining script then.

76
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
I mean, no, no, no. Yeah, well.

77
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
Yeah, actually.

78
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
But I guess I stand by my question because how often does it come up that you're like,

79
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,440
hey, I got to go to the store. And it's like, why are you telling me that?

80
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
It's like, well, cause I'm leaving to go to Olive Garden with my, like, how often do you

81
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
call Olive Garden the store? Apparently this person every Sunday after church.

82
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
The only reason you would do that is if you didn't want them to go to Olive Garden with you.

83
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,760
Yeah. I see.

84
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
You're trying to dissuade them from tagging along.

85
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm just going to the store with my family to have infinite soup, salad, and breadsticks.

86
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
I mean, oh no.

87
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,960
But then I think it's unlimited, not infinite.

88
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,360
Listen, I'm looking into the void.

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
It's just, it's one long breadstick that is a ray without a terminus point.

90
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,920
We don't know where the minestrone comes from. We open a valve and it just pours out.

91
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,080
Um, you could do your grocery shopping at Olive Garden.

92
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,400
You go in, you get a bunch of Andes mints.

93
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah.

94
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
You buy a bottle of the dressing.

95
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,280
You buy, like, see if they'll put a bunch of sauce in a vat for you.

96
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
You get a bunch of the noodles.

97
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,960
You can even snack on some of the dry ones in the containers.

98
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Yeah, if you wanted to.

99
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
You can even snack on some of those on the way home.

100
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
Yeah, if you needed to.

101
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,040
If you were told to, yeah, you probably would.

102
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,080
I feel like there's, like, if I were going to look for, like,

103
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
what is a restaurant most like, I wouldn't say a store.

104
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
I would say it's like a food vacation.

105
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
Oh, I like that.

106
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Do tell.

107
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
Because you get all the fun parts.

108
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
Princey's eating.

109
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah.

110
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Without, like, having to cook it or do dishes or whatever.

111
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,920
So you'd say, like, I'm going on vacation to eat the breadstick.

112
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,400
Yeah, I don't think you could.

113
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,600
I mean, you can say a lot of things, pretty much anything if you want.

114
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah, you could call it an interactive snack museum if you wanted to.

115
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm going to the Italian Heritage Celebration.

116
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,560
It's a festival that starts whenever I go in Olive Garden.

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Travis, do you mind if I move your mic up a little bit?

118
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm not getting the full experience.

119
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,760
There it is.

120
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
I really want to taste those plosives.

121
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
They have plosives there now.

122
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Plosives of Zeppole is one of the new desserts at Olive Garden.

123
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,080
A waiter just comes up and opens your mouth and goes,

124
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,200
This is actually a wonderful dovetail into this first question.

125
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
I am a chef at a casual fine dining restaurant.

126
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
It is a pretty good job, but it's a lot of work.

127
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,640
How can I continue to be a chef, but do less work, or even no work?

128
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,120
The restaurant is at a ski lodge, and all the employees live in the building.

129
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
If that helps, it doesn't.

130
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,080
And that's from Sam, who isn't even trying to cloak their shit.

131
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,960
Sam, are you here?

132
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,400
All right.

133
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
Got the night off, huh, Sam?

134
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,000
Sam, might I make a suggestion for a new hire, a new sous chef?

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,640
Grub Pub.

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,640
I love this.

137
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,600
Interesting.

138
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes.

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,720
How would that work?

140
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,360
Basically, it's like, what would you like, a hamburger?

141
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Okay, cool.

142
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
And then you pull out an iPad and you order it and say,

143
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
I think it'll be here in like, I don't know, 30 minutes.

144
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,840
I need your credit card information.

145
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Here's what you do.

146
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,880
You get the iPad, and where it says Grub Hub, you tape over it,

147
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
and it says restaurant menu.

148
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,880
Or menu for restaurant, if it's a really fancy place.

149
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,360
And then you just say like, here's our menu, we have everything,

150
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,480
and it'll be here soon, and at different times.

151
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
And it bags, and sometimes not all of it.

152
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
In fact, almost every time, not all of it.

153
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,560
And don't order a drink, because the ice will be melted.

154
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah.

155
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,320
It says here you do awesome blossom and blooming onions.

156
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
So, fuck yeah, we do.

157
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Like I said, it's a cool restaurant.

158
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,360
Yeah.

159
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,080
You could also change the hours of your restaurant to be like,

160
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,440
you're only open from like, 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. and like, 3 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.

161
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Yeah.

162
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,760
And then close, and then you won't have to work ever again.

163
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah.

164
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Your restaurant will have shuttered.

165
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,920
You could reach sort of like, Jiro's status from Jiro James of Sushi,

166
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,000
and turn your restaurant into just one counter with six chairs in it.

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
And you're like, yeah, that's right.

168
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
It's me, Sam, I'm so good.

169
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,840
Would you like the awesome blossom?

170
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Maybe you saw it on Netflix's new, good cooking show.

171
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
No rules, just right.

172
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
No rules, just right.

173
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
There's a donut store in Cincinnati where I live,

174
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
where every morning before they open,

175
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,480
they make a fixed amount of donuts.

176
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,360
And then when they have sold all the donuts, they close.

177
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,760
Yeah.

178
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,280
Which is, as far as I know, a bad business model.

179
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,840
Yeah.

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,040
Because it means that supply and demand,

181
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,560
demand was high and supply was not enough.

182
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,120
Well, you could-

183
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,640
And I'm pretty sure that's bad business.

184
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,240
The alternative though, to what you just described, Travis,

185
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
is that one, they end the day with a lot of donuts they throw in the trash,

186
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
or two, they stay open when they're out of donuts.

187
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
They stay open when they're out of donuts.

188
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,120
That seems ridiculous.

189
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,760
I don't know why.

190
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,840
They just take IOUs for the next day.

191
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,760
Are there shortcuts you could take with your mise en place

192
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,800
that you could just sort of convince the diner is cool and right?

193
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm thinking you serve your dish to the diner and you say,

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
oh, fish bones are super in right now.

195
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,320
It's rustic.

196
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,040
It's rustic.

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
We just leave them bones right.

198
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, you wanted your trout cooked at all?

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Okay, caveman.

200
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,400
This is kind of my take on a salad.

201
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,680
It's a bit deconstructed.

202
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
It's a head of lettuce and a whole tomato.

203
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
It's in a Kroger bag.

204
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
You're still eating sauce?

205
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,960
We're kind of casual acquaintances with Chef Mike.

206
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
He's a chef for McDonald's.

207
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,520
And I don't know why Mike started tweeting at me specifically.

208
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
Yeah, I can't fucking imagine, man.

209
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,920
But you could do like Chef Mike does and just like make something once and be like,

210
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,640
mmm, good.

211
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,560
Everybody make it just like that from now on.

212
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
This is a Big Mac too.

213
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
It's a sequel I made up.

214
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
I cooked it once.

215
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
Everybody else do this.

216
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm going home.

217
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
It's the end of my work day.

218
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,720
The food inventor.

219
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,760
I have a...

220
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,800
We got so many good Yahoos in the past couple of days.

221
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,640
A lot of them don't give us much of a runway for goofs, but I love them so much.

222
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,160
And instead of having eight closers at the end of each show, I've started to do Yahoo!

223
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,640
Juniors.

224
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
So here's a Yahoo!

225
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,900
Junior.

226
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
Jack sent this one in.

227
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,400
Thank you, Jack.

228
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,280
It's an anonymous Yahoo!

229
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,320
Answers user who I'm going to call Bonobos because there's an ad for it on my screen

230
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,320
who asks, what kind of facial hair is good for a writer slash poet?

231
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Anything that's long enough that you can dip it in the ink.

232
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Oh, Travis.

233
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
I was just about to say the exact same thing.

234
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,980
Damn it.

235
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
Now I don't have any jokes for the podcast.

236
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,040
You stole the obvious one where they dip their facial hair in ink, like a quill.

237
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,560
How about you just cut your beard into the shape of some of your favorite letters?

238
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,320
Like a basketball number shaped in the back of your head that's just like A in your cheek.

239
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Here's a big boy Yahoo!

240
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
This one was sent in by Sean.

241
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,880
Thank you, Sean.

242
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,760
It's anonymous.

243
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,920
No, they have a name, but the Wi-Fi just won't give it to me.

244
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,840
So I'm going to call them Bezos because here he is in another advertisement.

245
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
Oh no, this is news.

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,600
He's having some marital troubles.

247
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,800
Why are you laughing?

248
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,720
That's America's billionaire Jeff Bezos.

249
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,240
If we play it cool, he might give us some money.

250
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
He did the internet bookstore where we get our books.

251
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,280
Bezos asks, would you ever betray your soccer team

252
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:29,520
to impress someone or for any other reason?

253
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,120
If so, give me the reasons.

254
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,960
I think the only reason I would betray my soccer team

255
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,280
is if there was someone on the other team that I was crushing on.

256
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,320
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
And I thought, oh, they're looking if I were like an open net.

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah, they have those.

259
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,280
Sure.

260
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah.

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,920
And I scored and like, oh, they'll be angry.

262
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,800
But maybe if I let them win the big game, they'll be so happy.

263
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,840
But no, because they'd want to see your fire, your passion.

264
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
No, but that's the thing up till now.

265
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
What's kept us apart is my fire and passion.

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
I see, I see.

267
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
To Ben's and put their needs in front of my own.

268
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,960
Yeah, they want a real quitter.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
I just need to see that you can't follow through on something.

270
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm thinking soccer has a thing called own goal.

271
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,640
Soccer may be the most sabotageable sport.

272
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,280
If you really put your back into it, you can make it like it's a hundred and four to zero.

273
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,920
What the fuck is going on out there?

274
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,400
That is that is true, because with soccer, the ball could like maybe bounce off of the goal

275
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,080
and roll back the other way and accident.

276
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
It's really hard to accidentally score a basket on yourself.

277
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
Like, oh, it bounced off the backboard and across the whole court right into the other basket.

278
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,600
And with baseball, you would need to hit it so hard.

279
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,560
It went around the earth.

280
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,360
Yes.

281
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
And then came back around the next inning and then went over the hockey.

282
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
You could fight your own players like, oh, shit, man, I happen to get I'm sorry.

283
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
With these masks on, it's like, who knows?

284
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,040
Oh, we're in blue.

285
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,440
OK.

286
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
You ever think about how baseball is going to think about sports a lot?

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,920
Love sports.

288
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,560
You ever think about baseball?

289
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,760
They have a statistic for how many times you fuck up.

290
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
Like, it's a stack called error, and it means you fucked up and we wrote it down.

291
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,520
And there's a number that we associate with your God,

292
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm glad that's not like a real life feature.

293
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
It's a big count.

294
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh, McElroy is up to the.

295
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,120
Wow, this guy has errors out the wazoo.

296
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
They didn't even give it like a euphemism.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
It's no error error.

298
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
That was the wrong at baseball.

299
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
You did the wrong baseball that time, friend.

300
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
You got the golden glove for no goofing ups.

301
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,120
Oh, yeah.

302
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
Justin McElroy, he goes back to the catch.

303
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Oh, that's another bad he did.

304
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
He did a bad job.

305
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,480
You know, the secret is to betray your soccer team,

306
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
but not let them know that they've been betrayed.

307
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Oh, you go.

308
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
Here's the thing.

309
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
You leave your carton, your cooler of Little Debbie's

310
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
and hug juices over on the other team.

311
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I haven't played soccer since elementary school.

312
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
So they do that in the pros, too.

313
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,120
Yeah, you leave it over there.

314
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,680
And then when you go to fetch one, you just trip and you're like,

315
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,400
oh, no, all my tiny rolled up scrolls, right?

316
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
And then on one of them, you're accomplice

317
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
that the other team looks through and on one of them

318
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,680
is written a coded phrase.

319
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
And when they decode it, it says,

320
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,640
we're going to try to kick the ball into your goal more times.

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah, you kick it into ours.

322
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,320
So then their their minds in the right place.

323
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
They know exact every move you try.

324
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
There will be a point in the game where it looks like

325
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,560
I'm trying to take the ball downfield,

326
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,800
but then I'm going to kick it to somebody else

327
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,680
and they're going to do this.

328
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,760
Sometimes you guys will have the ball

329
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
and we'll try to get it with our feet.

330
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
You hear that, guys?

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
The note just says, I won't be using my hands.

332
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,560
We have a secret weapon.

333
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
One of our people can use their hands.

334
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
You'll never guess which one.

335
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
Here's another question.

336
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,520
My dad works at a-

337
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh, I think they're talking about being a fan of a soccer team.

338
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Dad gone.

339
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,560
Dad gone.

340
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,280
Some of these folks really like their soccer teams.

341
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,720
There's three pages of answers.

342
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,720
Why can't we say the word bollocks?

343
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,800
I think that should be everyone's takeaway for the evening.

344
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
We take everything else.

345
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,560
Certainly we could just take that too, right?

346
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,360
So can I read the next question?

347
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,760
Please.

348
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay.

349
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,640
My dad works at a small company that manufactures meat thermometers.

350
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
It's actually a pretty cool product.

351
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
I've seen it used by Anthony on Queer Eye.

352
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,440
Presumably to measure the temperature of an avocado.

353
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,760
Yes.

354
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,400
But my dad-

355
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
In this season, he stepped up the-

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm not going to stand for that.

357
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,680
It's a new Anthony season three.

358
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,240
This time he showed how to make the toast that goes with the avocado.

359
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
But my dad-

360
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,000
Hateful.

361
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
My dad has become borderline obsessed.

362
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,280
Two years ago for Christmas Eve, he gave us all key chain sized meat thermometers.

363
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,120
Now, when we go out to restaurants, he has a habit of interrogating the waitstaff about the kitchen's meat cooking methods.

364
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
Even though he always orders salads?

365
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,480
How do I make him understand that there are better times to promote his product than when I'm just trying to order chicken piccata?

366
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
That's from the sins of the father in Salt Lake City.

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,640
Are you-

368
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
Wait, are you here?

369
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,280
Yes.

370
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Yes, okay.

371
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
Yes, did you bring us one?

372
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
One of your cool new thermometers.

373
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,760
I guess so.

374
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
Your cool new thermometers.

375
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,400
I guess my first question is, a key chain meat thermometer, for when?

376
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah.

377
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
When does that come up?

378
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,760
Well, I have a key chain bottle opener, so I can see it having some sort of outdoor grilling party use.

379
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,640
But, I don't have to wash my key chain every time I use it.

380
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't have to wash my bottle opener every time I use it.

381
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,920
If you're dunking your-

382
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Before and after.

383
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Before and after, if I'm dunking my fucking keys into a piece of raw chicken?

384
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,080
Hopefully it's not raw.

385
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,040
Not raw, though.

386
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,160
Certainly not raw.

387
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Listen, I've had E. coli more than once.

388
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
He's had G. coli.

389
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,280
I've had, yeah, I've had F. coli.

390
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,440
I need, I need me one of these.

391
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,240
When your dad, this is how I assume that the conversation in the restaurant goes like,

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,920
oh, I just saw you brought a steak out.

393
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,280
Oh, yeah, that's our primary.

394
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm not, I'm just wondering, are you sure it's done?

395
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Yeah?

396
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Yeah, I think so.

397
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,960
Are you sure?

398
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,080
Huh.

399
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
Well, now that you mentioned it, no.

400
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,640
Damn, I was so ready to dunk on your dad, but I really have had E. coli a couple times,

401
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,080
and I'm thinking about it, and I know that you're not supposed to over grill a burger

402
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:42,480
for instance, but I had a hammed burger today at our hotel, and I asked for it medium,

403
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
and I bit into it, and it was the good pink color inside that you want it to be sometimes,

404
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
but that still had that part of me that's like, I'm not a shit.

405
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
I don't know how pink is too pink.

406
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,520
If I could have had a small apparatus that I just had in my wallet or something.

407
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
And it's not just for measuring your consumable meat.

408
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,520
If you have a friend that's like, well, I'm not feeling very good.

409
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,000
You just be like, well, hold on a second, roll up your sleeve.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,320
Jab.

411
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,480
98.6, looks okay to me.

412
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,960
Yeah.

413
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
Would you say that you're-

414
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
You're undercooked though, you're raw.

415
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,360
Would you say your arm is similar to a pork loin?

416
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,920
Hey man, well done.

417
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm called for.

418
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,680
Here's the thing, I would say, your dad sounds like a closer to me.

419
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,880
That's how you go from being a small meat thermometer business-

420
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,200
Yes.

421
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,920
To a successful large meat thermometer business.

422
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Well, the meat thermometers would still be small.

423
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,120
Let's not get it twisted because it is key chain size.

424
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
He could go on Shark Tank and when he's doing his pitch, he can be like,

425
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,840
I've annoyed over 30 Applebee's.

426
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,360
Yes, I'm the man you've heard about from the stories of Applebee's employees.

427
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Las Cruces Applebee's, I've annoyed them.

428
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,520
Urbana, Applebee's, both.

429
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,080
Yes.

430
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
They hate my guts.

431
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,160
I've been banned from several Applebee's.

432
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,320
I have a Yahoo Junior here that was sent in by Riley.

433
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,040
Thank you, Riley.

434
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,400
It's from- Oh, I got it.

435
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Yahoo answers user Trouble Gum who asks,

436
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
is it safe for me to lick my Himalayan salt lamp every now and then?

437
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
Every now and then?

438
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,920
Yeah, more than that though and you don't have a lamp anymore.

439
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,880
That's a good point.

440
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,680
My Himalayan salt lamp is fricking delicious.

441
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,200
Better than table salt.

442
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,880
I give it a lick every now and then, maybe once a day or two.

443
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,040
And it's safe for me to lick my Himalayan salt lamp every now and then.

444
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,400
And it is the most gratifying taste.

445
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,840
Why?

446
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,960
Are you a deer?

447
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,880
Would there be any trace minerals in it that could harm me or actually improve my health?

448
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,960
I can answer the second one and it's no.

449
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,040
Well, well, my allergies and eczema have vanished.

450
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,120
The air stays cool, dry, and comfortable.

451
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,320
What?

452
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
Because you licked the lamp?

453
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
Sounds like you're adding some minerals to it.

454
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Also-

455
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
Can I lick you?

456
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,720
Sounds like you've got choice minerals.

457
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,040
It is weird to say it is more delicious than table salt

458
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,400
unless you are just licking table salt by itself as well.

459
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,920
Well, somebody does point out you can buy Himalayan pink salt.

460
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,120
And that just buying salt lamps is not a very cost-effective way of going about-

461
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
You can just buy it and then sprinkle it on a light bulb.

462
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
It would almost be, yeah.

463
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,240
Eating that would almost be better than eating one with wires in it, if you think about it.

464
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,960
Here's a big Yahoo from Peyton.

465
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,520
Thanks, Peyton.

466
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
It's Yahoo Answers user Spike who asks,

467
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,040
Why do people think my fighting stance is weak?

468
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
This is the best first sentence.

469
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
I have three weak points on my body.

470
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:36,960
On my body, my nose, my jaw, and my stomach, and my crack.

471
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
My neck, my back, my solar plexus.

472
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,000
My right fist is in front of my nose.

473
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
My left fist is in front of my jaw.

474
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,560
And I keep my chin low so I'm looking through my eyebrows.

475
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,800
Well, that's nothing.

476
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,480
Like I'm a character in Fallout 3 who's just like clipping.

477
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,600
Bugged out.

478
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
I have a slight bend in my knees to hunch my stomach.

479
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,240
Can one of you like-

480
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,800
Yeah, I'll do it.

481
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Start at the beginning.

482
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,640
We'll probably cut this out.

483
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
So this is just for you guys.

484
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,240
Demonstrate your weak points.

485
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,760
Your nose, jaw, and stomach.

486
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
Yes. Nose, jaw, stomach.

487
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,100
Thank you.

488
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,680
My right fist is in front of my nose.

489
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,280
My left hand's on blue.

490
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,160
My left fist is in front of my jaw.

491
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,360
And I keep my chin low so I'm looking through my eyebrows.

492
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,560
I have a slight bend in my knees to hunch my stomach back.

493
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,480
Bend the knees though.

494
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,840
Keep them bent.

495
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,960
You got to bend those knees.

496
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,160
You got to bend those knees.

497
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And I bob and weave my head back and forth to be ready for a dodge encounter.

498
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,480
I bob and weave my head back and forth to be ready for a dodge encounter.

499
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,400
The only part of my skull-

500
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,120
The only part of my skull that is exposed and hard enough-

501
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Is hard enough to break your hand.

502
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
Hell, we headbutt for a reason, right?

503
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,720
That's all, Justin.

504
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,220
Thank you.

505
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:23,780
There's more to the question, but that's all the demo we need.

506
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,100
In my mind, this is the perfect stance.

507
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,580
But for some reason, when I show this stance, my friends think I can't fight.

508
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,500
Seeing it, I can't imagine.

509
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,300
Now, we are full-grown adults, but we don't dare find out.

510
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,220
It could get ugly fast.

511
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,620
And tbh, I don't have much fighting experience.

512
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,300
So I'm just hoping to get perspective from fighters.

513
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Is my stance actually bad or are they playing mind games?

514
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,620
Because I kind of let them mess with me a little bit because they're my buddies.

515
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,420
Sometimes I want to kick someone's ass just to prove I could.

516
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,620
Other times, I'm not sure I can.

517
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,540
I've always had the perfect demeanor in life to avoid all conflict.

518
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,100
Never the victim and never the instigator.

519
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,980
Something about me makes people not want to test me.

520
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,460
But I sure as shoot don't test anyone either.

521
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,380
So I just avoided so much fighting by simply not having to.

522
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,180
It's a strange feeling to not know where I stand.

523
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,500
The Kelsey Grammer autobiography is so much weirder than you think it's gonna be.

524
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,860
Is it possible that your friends don't think your physical stance is weak,

525
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,900
but rather your metaphysical stance on fighting?

526
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,400
Yeah.

527
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,980
I don't know.

528
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,700
I don't want to test you.

529
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,200
Weak.

530
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,100
I've never been in a traditional fight.

531
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,300
But if the only part of me you can hit is the top of my skull,

532
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm basically an ankylosaurus at that.

533
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,740
I'm basically an ankylosaurus at that point.

534
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,540
You're just getting my plating at that, you know?

535
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,420
Here's the thing, though.

536
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,340
I feel like saying I only have three weak points is a strong stance

537
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,340
when I'm thinking about my own body and I can list off at least 27.

538
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,540
I'm too high on the earth and I feel weak.

539
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
Travis has altitude poisoning.

540
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,860
I woke up bad from sleeping and I hurt.

541
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,620
I have inside weak points that sometimes I eat some angel hair pasta

542
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,580
for the Cheesecake Factory and then I spend a whole live show

543
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,540
thinking about how excited I am to poop as soon as it's over.

544
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,460
How did it know?

545
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,220
One of my big weak points is time.

546
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,220
Just my physical age on the earth.

547
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,940
I like that we can all agree this person's never been in a fight.

548
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,700
Yes, correct.

549
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,020
I want to know who we headbutt for a reason is referring to.

550
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,220
A team he's on, maybe?

551
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,260
A club?

552
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,860
I like humans in general.

553
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Humans in general headbutt for a reason?

554
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,340
I don't know.

555
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,180
This is a response from Yahoo Answers user All Hat who says,

556
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,420
best way to learn about that is to enroll in a boxing gym or karate school.

557
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,500
There, of course, you actually do spar and it's legal and so forth.

558
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,060
I love that because I'm this person and I show up to karate school

559
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,700
and I say, what do you think about this?

560
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,020
And then they're like, it's bad and nothing.

561
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,260
And you could say, thanks for the lessons.

562
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,180
You know what?

563
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,100
I'll come back when I have something better.

564
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,940
When you do it, Griffin, it kind of looks like you're playing like air saxophone.

565
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,660
It did a little bit.

566
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,300
I felt that way.

567
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:57,140
You know all about that as big jazz fans here.

568
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,700
Yeah, sure.

569
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:07,620
We are in your airport and there is a room labeled Jazz Room

570
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,060
and Travis is walking past and said, it's all about the rooms you don't go into.

571
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,900
That's a very good joke.

572
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:22,020
Asshole.

573
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,620
Jazz it up for us there, Justin.

574
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,260
Good idea.

575
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,020
You guys love jazz.

576
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:48,420
That's pretty good jazz.

577
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,620
I want a munch.

578
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:58,260
I want a munch.

579
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,500
Toast salad and scrambled eggs.

580
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,980
Welcome to Munch Squad.

581
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,300
It's a podcast within a podcast that covers the latest and greatest in brand eating.

582
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,500
This week we have a big story for you.

583
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,980
Heinz cream egg mayo.

584
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,460
It wasn't an April fool.

585
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,780
You can try it for yourself.

586
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,860
Cream egg?

587
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,500
Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise.

588
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,620
Because I was about to say mayonnaise is technically a kind of creamy egg substance.

589
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,660
We were a little wary when this story comes to us from Metro.

590
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,980
What day was it posted?

591
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,620
April 3rd.

592
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,700
Yes, this is right.

593
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,980
This is happening.

594
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,860
We were a little wary when we first heard Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise was a thing.

595
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,420
I can't imagine why.

596
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,940
Yeah, a little wary.

597
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,500
You've been dulled by the past few years, I think.

598
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,140
Mainly because it was announced close to April Fool's Day

599
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,460
and it wouldn't be the first time this product was announced as an April fool.

600
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,140
But actually the news is true.

601
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,140
We regret to inform you that this day that will live in infamy.

602
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,580
Hug your loved ones close.

603
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,740
Nearer my God to thee, the creamy condiment does exist.

604
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,740
You can actually try it.

605
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,900
Heinz and Cadbury have partnered in hell to create.

606
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:45,140
It's called the Heinz, seriously good, Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise.

607
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

608
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,260
Fuck yes.

609
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,580
What's up?

610
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,620
We're Coca-Cola.

611
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,900
We made a broccoli flavor.

612
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,940
We called it.

613
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,220
Seriously, it's good.

614
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,100
Try it once, coward.

615
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,700
This unusual concoction is going to be available for a limited time.

616
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,580
Thank Christ.

617
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,820
At a unique Heinz X Cadbury cream egg installation, which is a bad place

618
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:23,300
at the Truman brewery in London, sadly, from April 11th to the 13th.

619
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,340
I gotta buy some plain tickets.

620
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,300
There's a caption.

621
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,540
The caption of the photo says the mayonnaise, which is a pot of mayo mixed with pieces of

622
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,580
cream egg, hold on.

623
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,180
It's a Cadbury aioli.

624
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:47,540
I can't believe they'd give away the yuck juice family secret like that.

625
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,020
The next sentence from this publication is wild, though we're pleased that this isn't

626
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,540
an April fool, why?

627
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,300
We're not sure it will taste all that nice.

628
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,820
God, Patty, that is the most generous sentence I've ever heard in the English language.

629
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,780
And what a weird swing of a sentence of like, we're glad it's real, but also, ew.

630
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,060
Ew, gross.

631
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,340
I know people are always talking about ethics and condiment review blogs, but it's that

632
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,180
kind of like sticking it to the man that I really appreciate.

633
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,900
On the launch, Martina Davis, who is the brand manager for Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise,

634
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,780
said, oh, what a short time career.

635
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,580
Yeah.

636
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,780
And, and.

637
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,980
I just bought a house.

638
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,020
Ew.

639
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,780
And war criminal.

640
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:46,260
She said, we have had so much fun creating this unique cream egg mayo because we're sadists.

641
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,380
For Easter, with our friends over at Cadbury, we absolutely cannot wait for people to try

642
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,940
it.

643
00:38:51,940 --> 00:39:00,580
The, the photo that they've distributed here is the tub of Heinz Seriously Good Cream Egg

644
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,780
Mayonnaise with a little Cadbury cream egg leaning next to it in a jaunty fashion.

645
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,500
And then behind, in the back, blurred out, out of focus, is a jar of good old fashioned

646
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:20,100
good mayonnaise, and it's got a real egg leaning against it, as if to say, like, you know, eggs.

647
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,060
They've both got eggs.

648
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:31,380
It almost looks like the, the wayward boyfriend meme, and he's like looking at the Cadbury

649
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,420
cream egg, like, oh, it's, except they're both, it's like that photo, except if everyone

650
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,460
in it was vomiting.

651
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,020
Yeah.

652
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,860
The quote from Martina continues, it's unlike anything you've ever tasted before.

653
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,220
I should sure the fuck hope so.

654
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,180
A true, it's a true taste sensation.

655
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,660
If everyone loves it as much as they do, then who knows?

656
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,540
We might have to roll it out nationwide one day.

657
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,060
Don't fucking threaten me.

658
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,820
Please, don't like it as much as we do.

659
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,780
It says, and then it says, I swear to God, it says, watch this space.

660
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,300
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

661
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,100
And then it says, I swear to God, it says, watch this space.

662
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,380
So I'm assuming that Martina just spread her butt cheeks apart at that point.

663
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,900
Raphael Capitani, the brand manager for Cadbury cream egg added, fuck if I know, right?

664
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:30,100
Anyway, no, Raphael says, we're so excited to announce that our Heinz, seriously good,

665
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,580
Cadbury cream egg mayo collaboration is actually happening, and we can't wait for people to

666
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:40,500
try it for themselves because we're fucked up and nasty to the max, it says here.

667
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,460
We're looking forward to seeing cream egg and Heinz fans head down to the installation

668
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,340
to taste this deliciously gooey spread.

669
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,740
Oh, God.

670
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,780
Oh, God.

671
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,300
I can taste it now.

672
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,460
You know what?

673
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,620
I will say it is evocative writing.

674
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,660
I will say, anyway, that's this week's lunch squad.

675
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,220
Hey, everybody, this is Griffin.

676
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,900
I'm going to do the ads myself because everybody's kind of scrambling right now.

677
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,260
We're about to kick off the Become the Monster Tour 2019 coming for you, Cleveland.

678
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,980
Going to just eat you up.

679
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,180
And so I'm going to do the sponsorships.

680
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,660
Sorry about the audio quality of this one.

681
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:43,300
I tried to tweak the knobs and the dials that I have on the big switchboard that I have

682
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:49,540
in my production studio that the Doobie Brothers let me use sometimes, and I did my best.

683
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,900
Anyway, Squarespace has given us a sponsorship, and I'm going to tell you all about them

684
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,860
starting right now.

685
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,620
Have you ever heard of Squarespace?

686
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,660
They're the ones who make you do websites.

687
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,140
They're the ones who give you the tools to do websites.

688
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,620
That's better.

689
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:09,380
They have all kinds of very handy stuff like, I don't know, man.

690
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,980
They got like templates.

691
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,420
They got these templates.

692
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,380
They were made by world-class designers, so you know that they're not shit.

693
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,500
And then they also have powerful e-commerce functionality.

694
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,980
Dollars and cents makes the world go round.

695
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,340
And they also have 24-7 award-winning customer support.

696
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,380
So, they basically have everything that you need to make a very successful website.

697
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,980
Not a pets.com.

698
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,180
That one is gone.

699
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,540
That website died.

700
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,420
But a very good website, pets.com2, maybe, even if you wanted to.

701
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,700
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother and get a free trial when you're ready to launch.

702
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,340
Use the offer code my brother, and you'll save 10% off your first purchase of a website

703
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,460
or a domain.

704
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,420
Get out there.

705
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,300
Pets.com2 is waiting for you.

706
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,460
I'm also going to tell you about MeUndies.

707
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,180
MeUndies has a very exciting scientific development they've been working on in their underground

708
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,460
underwear lab.

709
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,140
And they do horrible experiments down there.

710
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,820
Horrible, horrible experiments involving elastic.

711
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,860
And somebody gets that they did super elastic because they were like, our fabric is super

712
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,140
soft, so let's do, you know, maybe even a tighter elastic band.

713
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,380
When, you know what, someone got cut right in half.

714
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,860
I don't approve of that, but if it gets us this new development, which is boxer briefs

715
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,780
with a fly, using the same micromodal fabric that's three times softer than cotton, it's

716
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,700
a life changing revelation.

717
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,660
I don't have to pull my, you know, my pants all the way down to my ankles whenever I have

718
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,660
to pee in a public urinal.

719
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,900
And that's what I've had to do traditionally.

720
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,580
And there's people who say, Griffin, you don't have to pull them all the way down.

721
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,180
And I said, yeah, dribble on these, Levi's?

722
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,220
I don't think so.

723
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,660
But now I know that that's wrong.

724
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,940
You can get 15% off your first pair of MeUndies.

725
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,780
You gotta get these boxer briefs ones.

726
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,500
You can get free shipping and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

727
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,740
Go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

728
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,060
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

729
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,620
I'm gonna let you get back to it.

730
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,340
If you haven't looked at our tour, the Become the Monster tour, go check it out.

731
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,220
McElroy.family.

732
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,980
See if we're coming to a city near you.

733
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,180
Actually, about half our shows have sold out at this point.

734
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,420
There's still plenty available for Cleveland and Cincinnati, which are this week.

735
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,020
So if you live in the Ohio area, come say hi.

736
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,460
And I think that's it.

737
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,420
Enjoy the rest of the episode.

738
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:48,420
Goodbye.

739
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:14,260
Club podcast where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans as we reminisce about

740
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,780
our adolescences and how they led us to becoming who we are.

741
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,940
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

742
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,500
Yes, hello.

743
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,620
Howdy.

744
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,180
Hey, what's up?

745
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:26,580
Hi.

746
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,300
What's your name?

747
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,100
Who are you?

748
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,140
You said my name, man.

749
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,700
I just called like four people.

750
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,660
Who's your, what's your name?

751
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,140
Eli.

752
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,780
Hello, Eli.

753
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,380
Eli, you're leaning on the door.

754
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,060
This is such a chill vibe.

755
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,380
Yeah.

756
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,620
Oh, believe me, I'm incredibly nervous.

757
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,180
Okay, good.

758
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,140
Your question, do you need a reminder of what your prompt was?

759
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,500
No, I think I know it.

760
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:46,820
Okay.

761
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,740
You can read it if you want so everyone else knows it.

762
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:57,380
Your prompt, your teaser is, and it was, we struggled with it, but we could not know more

763
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,580
was, if I made you guys a knife, would you accept it?

764
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:10,100
And we want to walk through this with you.

765
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,500
All right.

766
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,220
So I make knives as a hobby.

767
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,940
Cool.

768
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,980
And do you guys want one?

769
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,100
Not necessarily the fertile.

770
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,340
Once you've made a sale, stop selling.

771
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,260
The answer is yes.

772
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:26,900
Obviously.

773
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,380
Sweet.

774
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:28,820
Cool.

775
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,700
Good talk.

776
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,060
Yeah, thanks, Eli.

777
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,420
Now, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait.

778
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,900
First off, holy shit, Paul.

779
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,340
Really, bud?

780
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,260
This is the strongest drink I've ever tasted in my life.

781
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,500
In Salt Lake City.

782
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:44,820
Yeah.

783
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:47,940
Okay.

784
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,940
It might be the strongest drink that exists in Salt Lake City right now.

785
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,500
Okay.

786
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,980
Eli, are we talking about cooking knives?

787
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,140
Are we talking about stabbing knives?

788
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,860
Are we talking about LARPing knives?

789
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,180
That's how Mr. Bean would sell a stabbing knife.

790
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,260
Depends on what you guys want.

791
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,580
Cool.

792
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,460
Knives to order.

793
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,780
You really put me on the spot.

794
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,260
I mean, here's the question.

795
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,580
What's the delivery process going to look like?

796
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:28,900
Because if the answer is into your torso, then hard pass.

797
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,340
If you want me to stab you, I mean-

798
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,460
No, I don't.

799
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,100
No, no.

800
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,940
I knew Eli would say that.

801
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,580
Yeah.

802
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,260
I got shit to do tomorrow.

803
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,900
Oh, my bad.

804
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,500
I would like a really tiny knife.

805
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:40,820
All right.

806
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,780
Oh, fun.

807
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,500
Little butter knife.

808
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,140
Give it to my daughter.

809
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,020
I'm sentimental.

810
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,660
I'm being careful here, Eli, because one time during a live show, to be funny,

811
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,460
we said that someone should mail their decommissioned hand grenades to us.

812
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,260
And they did.

813
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,300
Yeah, we got those.

814
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,260
And then they did.

815
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,820
And I threw them in the trash because it sucked.

816
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,420
No, you are a coward, sir.

817
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:02,900
I'm a coward.

818
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,380
Also, one time during a Taz, I yelled, does anybody have a pen?

819
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,180
And people started throwing pins at me from the audience.

820
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:16,340
So obviously, in this scenario, that would be a knife, bad and rough.

821
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,980
Less than ideal.

822
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,300
So I guess thank you for the knives in advance, Eli.

823
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,820
I have so many more questions.

824
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,260
Can it be made out of a cool sort of substance and not just necessarily metal?

825
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,500
No.

826
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,340
Do you forge them?

827
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,220
Do you forge them?

828
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,260
Yes, I do, actually.

829
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,500
Okay.

830
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,220
Sick.

831
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,260
How sharp we talking?

832
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,180
My first one wasn't that sharp, but I can make them sharper.

833
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,820
But which-

834
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,540
Wait, are you-

835
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,580
Wait, what number of knives are you on?

836
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,220
Stop.

837
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,220
I don't want your second knife.

838
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,020
Are you telling me you make knives as a hobby and so far your tally is one?

839
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,300
And it wasn't that sharp?

840
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,700
That's called a shitty spoon, Eli.

841
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,740
No, no, no.

842
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,260
Hey, don't step on Eli's dreams.

843
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,580
How many knives have you made, Eli?

844
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,020
One.

845
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:10,500
All right.

846
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Eli, you are a pioneer.

847
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,620
You don't make knives as a hobby, you make knife as a hobby.

848
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,180
No, no, no.

849
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:16,500
Listen, listen, listen.

850
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,660
I mean, I plan on making more.

851
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,460
I'm jealous-

852
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,460
We all plan on making more.

853
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,580
I'm jealous of your hobby.

854
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,540
It's very cool and very-

855
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,900
I like watching a good knife getting made on YouTube and that's not a joke.

856
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,820
I have weird algorithms now.

857
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,460
Alex Steele.

858
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,420
I watched a Facebook video today about a new kind of cement mixer.

859
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,220
That's where I'm at.

860
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,700
I don't want your second knife, Eli.

861
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,620
I'll make more and then I'll send them.

862
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,820
I want your 20th knife.

863
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,300
All right.

864
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,580
I want you to stick with it.

865
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,140
Stick with it.

866
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,860
Never give up.

867
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,660
Chase your dream.

868
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,060
Get boutique on this shit and send me your 20th knife.

869
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,780
You know, we're giving Eli a hard time.

870
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,260
I'm not.

871
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,340
I want you to chase your dreams.

872
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,740
We wouldn't blow up Luke Skywalker this way, right?

873
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,140
Like, this is only my first lightsaber I've made.

874
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,460
And he didn't even make that one.

875
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,540
Like, he didn't even pick the fucking kyber crystals.

876
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,460
He was just like, well, I'll take my dad's, I guess.

877
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,700
Anyway, Eli, does that help?

878
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:14,980
Yes.

879
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,780
Thank you, Eli.

880
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,940
I look forward to receiving your 20th knife.

881
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,820
Excellent work, Eli.

882
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,900
Excellent work.

883
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,620
What's up?

884
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,500
Hello.

885
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,060
Hello.

886
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,940
What's your name?

887
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,580
Cameron.

888
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:28,900
Cameron.

889
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,380
Hey, Cameron.

890
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,820
No, you go.

891
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,380
The prompt that Cameron provided was, how do I, parentheses, non-lethally.

892
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,220
A good start.

893
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,060
Booby trap my kitchen.

894
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,700
All right.

895
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,500
The floor is yours.

896
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,700
So here's the story behind it.

897
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,580
So I have five other roommates, including me.

898
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,780
Well, I'm the sixth.

899
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,620
So I have five roommates.

900
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,820
Do you live in a terrace house?

901
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,500
I live in a college house.

902
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,000
Okay.

903
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,700
And we share one kitchen.

904
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,540
And so at the beginning of the year, we divvied up all of the drawers and cabinets and everything.

905
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,340
And I have my cabinets and they have their cabinets.

906
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,020
My cabinets go, the stuff in there goes missing a lot.

907
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,540
Even though I said, hey, can you keep my stuff in my cabinets?

908
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,140
So my question to you is how do I non-lethally booby trap?

909
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:19,860
I got that much.

910
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,100
Yeah.

911
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,980
All of mine.

912
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,480
Yeah.

913
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,380
Maybe you can.

914
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,420
Maybe rather than physical harm.

915
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,380
Cause that's bad.

916
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,940
What about emotional harm?

917
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,980
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out.

918
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,100
They open the cabinet.

919
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,900
You've installed a mirror and just you've written on it.

920
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,620
Look at yourself.

921
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,120
Yeah.

922
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,540
And they have to really live with what they're doing.

923
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,740
Or under your package of ciabatta bread,

924
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,860
you've stuck a picture of you like holding your tummy, like, so hunky.

925
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,820
I did something to that vein.

926
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,300
I took my silverware out of the drawer and I put a piece of paper in there that said,

927
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,740
I know you're taking my stuff.

928
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,240
Stop.

929
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,620
And that didn't work.

930
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,680
Yeah.

931
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,460
Cause if I saw that, I would feel like, well, now I'm going to become like more of a gentleman

932
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,340
silverware thief.

933
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,840
Yeah.

934
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,500
It's more of a challenge.

935
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,300
But if you just said like, oh, here's what you do.

936
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,260
Put all the silverware back and say, you must need this more than I do.

937
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,020
Oh yeah.

938
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,520
Guilt.

939
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,420
Very good.

940
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,420
Now you're like the priest from Les Mis.

941
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,540
Take my loaf of bread, Valjean.

942
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,140
Take my half empty mustard.

943
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,620
Cameron, I got something.

944
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,260
But you forgot the half empty ketchup.

945
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,820
I got something you could try.

946
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,460
So here's what you're going to do.

947
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:50,100
You're going to go into your fridge and get yourself a little jar of jelly.

948
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,980
And then you're going to go to half of the handle and you're going to absolutely fucking

949
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,260
coat it in jelly.

950
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,720
Just half.

951
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,700
And now it's important to come up with some sort of mnemonic device like, Cameron has

952
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,740
an R in it and R is the first letter of right.

953
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,260
And I can grab the right side of the handle because there's no jelly on it.

954
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,340
And then they go for it.

955
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,820
Full meaty paw grab.

956
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,340
Oops.

957
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,700
Sticky fingers.

958
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,200
Yeah.

959
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,380
Because of the jelly I put on it, idiot.

960
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,820
And this important, Cameron, that you be in the kitchen all the time.

961
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,780
This is an easily wipe awayable sort of trap.

962
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,140
So you need to be ready.

963
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,460
If they do that, you have to throw the jelly at them.

964
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:41,960
Yeah.

965
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,460
They can't come away un-jellyed from the experience.

966
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,700
Yes.

967
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,100
Right.

968
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,820
So important.

969
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,540
Does that help?

970
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,180
Yes, it does.

971
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:48,980
Thank you, Cameron.

972
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,460
Good.

973
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:49,940
Excellent.

974
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,380
Should we queue up one more?

975
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:55,880
Yes.

976
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,380
Let's get Sidney E, row E, I guess, ten five.

977
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,620
That may mean you're up on the balcony.

978
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,980
Okay, it worked.

979
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,260
Sidney, hello.

980
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,380
Hello.

981
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,100
What's your name?

982
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,900
I'm Grace.

983
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,380
Hi, Grace.

984
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,660
Grace is leaning in the door frame.

985
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,780
Even more casual.

986
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,660
So many casual.

987
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,220
Than Eli.

988
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,380
As if Grace is waiting for an informant.

989
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,420
Yes.

990
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,620
What's your question?

991
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,220
Grace, tell us the truth about Richard Nixon.

992
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,440
Okay.

993
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,700
Grace, your question, the prompt.

994
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,340
How do I assert my dominance at the Home Depot?

995
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:33,960
It's good.

996
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,640
It's good.

997
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,440
What do you got, Grace?

998
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,120
Tell us more.

999
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,920
I am an electrician.

1000
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,360
That is my day job.

1001
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,860
Excellent.

1002
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,080
Holy shit.

1003
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,480
How many electricians are in the house tonight?

1004
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,600
Yeah, so often I have to go to, you know, Home Depot or Lowe's

1005
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,000
and pick up random parts because men don't know how to order things.

1006
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,240
Sure.

1007
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,680
Am I right?

1008
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,720
No, you're right.

1009
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
I'm wrong, actually.

1010
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,120
I don't know where to get, like, a switch.

1011
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,980
Sure.

1012
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,400
The electrical aisle.

1013
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,720
Yeah, that'd be a good place to start, probably.

1014
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,800
When I moved into my house, I discovered that there was a light fixture

1015
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,080
that was just always on.

1016
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,720
And so I went to the Home Depot and I bought all the pieces to make a switch.

1017
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,640
And that was a year and a half ago.

1018
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,040
And still on.

1019
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,540
Yeah.

1020
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,960
Travis's house is a Motel 6, essentially, is what he said.

1021
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,460
Yeah.

1022
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,760
You probably just have your switch leg and your constant hot mixed up.

1023
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,280
You can ask somebody about that.

1024
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,840
That's the realization I came to as I bought the ability to do it.

1025
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,240
So what's your question?

1026
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,120
Well, my problem is I am, sadly, very adorable.

1027
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:59,240
So when I am in the Home Depot, it is very hard for people to just let me be

1028
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,360
and get my things.

1029
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,560
Yes.

1030
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,640
How do I assert that I am the boss of the trade goods?

1031
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:06,840
Do you know?

1032
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,280
Here's what I would suggest.

1033
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,560
If somebody comes up to you and they're really patronizing without saying a word,

1034
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,040
just rewire the whole store.

1035
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,600
It's good.

1036
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,160
Usually I just smile.

1037
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,320
While maintaining constant eye contact.

1038
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:25,560
Yeah.

1039
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,080
You just raise your hand like, and all the lights go out.

1040
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:36,440
I have this crystallized memory in my mind of at my old house, the first house I owned,

1041
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,560
it needed some work.

1042
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,040
And one of the things it needed to work with is that like the drippings that came out of

1043
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:48,280
the AC unit upstairs, the previous owners had to come down some PVC piping into a sink

1044
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,760
in the garage, just a plastic sink in the garage that emptied out into nothing.

1045
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,520
It emptied out onto the floor,

1046
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:02,040
which we, for a long time, just put a cooler under that we had to dump out every two days.

1047
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,240
But then I was like, I'm going to figure this shit out.

1048
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,760
I'm going to get some PVC pipe, I'm going to figure out how to cut it and make a thing.

1049
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,520
And so I went to the Home Depot and I was like, it took me 20 minutes to find where

1050
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,480
the PVC lives.

1051
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,760
And then I looked at all of the wonderful sprockets and joints as just employee after

1052
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,280
employee just looked at me and said, he knows what to do.

1053
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,840
He knows what to do and that's never been true.

1054
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,040
That's a good point, Griffin.

1055
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,640
When I'm at Home Depot or Lowe's or what have you, I have always adopted the most helpless

1056
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,600
look possible.

1057
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,080
Yeah.

1058
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,200
I cannot get assist.

1059
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,840
I'm wandering around with my hands in the air like, help me.

1060
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,720
I literally crawl on my hands and knees like a baby.

1061
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,320
I supplicate myself in front of the vest wearers, hoping that one of them will shine their light

1062
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,520
on me.

1063
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,640
Can you wear a shirt that says, my name is Grayson, I'm crazy about wires.

1064
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,600
Or clothes that you've made out of lights and wires and robot parts and you walk in

1065
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,080
and be like.

1066
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,360
That's very good.

1067
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,320
That's for Christmas.

1068
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,600
Yes.

1069
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,600
Can you dress in more of a steampunk fashion that says, I know about technology.

1070
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,400
I mean, that'll help.

1071
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,920
Could you, no, actually, I don't.

1072
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,840
I usually just make eye contact and make a point to not smile.

1073
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,920
That's good.

1074
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,600
That'll get you out of a lot of social situations, I feel like.

1075
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,400
It sounds like you're better at intimidating people than we are.

1076
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:33,880
Absolutely.

1077
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,920
We'll come to you for advice the next time that we need assistance.

1078
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,680
You lost me at make eye contact.

1079
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,040
With a person?

1080
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,680
No.

1081
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,480
Are you sure?

1082
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,400
Maybe with a dog on a good day.

1083
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,280
Does that help?

1084
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,600
Tremendously.

1085
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,000
It's okay.

1086
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:53,880
Thank you.

1087
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,640
Over here, yes, you've been waiting for a long time.

1088
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,040
Hello.

1089
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,800
What's up?

1090
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,360
What's your name?

1091
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,840
My name is Jared.

1092
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,640
Just making sure.

1093
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,440
Jared.

1094
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,040
Jared, I just want you to know, I saw that when we complimented Grace on standing cool

1095
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,960
in the doorway, I watched Jared go...

1096
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,200
Stand even cooler.

1097
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,920
This is the, Jared is the most chill position.

1098
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,160
Jared's at about 55 degrees.

1099
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:32,040
Yeah, he's doing the thing from Smooth Criminal where they nailed his shoes to the ground.

1100
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,080
Jared, what's up?

1101
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,320
Not much, guys.

1102
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,800
Cool, cool.

1103
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,240
Good hang, Griffin.

1104
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,560
Your prompt was, how can I stop being a picky eater?

1105
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,040
And I just really want to dial into this because...

1106
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,800
So what do you eat?

1107
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,200
Hey, front-deer buddy, what are you into?

1108
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:58,520
I do like a lot of foods, but there's some specific foods that I can't handle and it

1109
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,080
ruled out a lot of meals for me.

1110
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,440
That doesn't sound like a picky eater.

1111
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,040
That sounds like everyone.

1112
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1113
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,520
Give us some of the categories, Jared.

1114
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,040
Unless that pickiness is like grain, dairy, and meat.

1115
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,600
And anything that casts a shadow, I am...

1116
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,560
Get right up on that microphone, Jared.

1117
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,280
What's your faves?

1118
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,280
My favorite foods?

1119
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,680
Sure.

1120
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,640
Or the more fearful?

1121
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
No, just what are some of your favorite things?

1122
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,080
How do you feel about raindrops on roofs?

1123
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,720
Okay, we're gonna let Jared talk.

1124
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,720
Jared, just my question, ignore them.

1125
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,920
What don't you like?

1126
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,600
Soups.

1127
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,440
That's good actually.

1128
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,680
Come on, you lost me already.

1129
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:50,600
Beans, tomatoes, onions, I feel like my fiancee could tell me a lot of things.

1130
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,320
I will say...

1131
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:51,960
Seafood.

1132
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,000
Seafood is so broad though.

1133
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,040
That's so many things.

1134
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,800
You know the ocean, very large, covers most of the world.

1135
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,640
Any other big ones?

1136
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,360
Broccoli, a lot of vegetables.

1137
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:11,160
Okay, so when you said some foods, you meant most.

1138
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,080
Yeah, a lot of things you don't like.

1139
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,240
Here's the thing, I'm with you on soup.

1140
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,120
What a waste.

1141
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,560
What a waste of calories.

1142
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,600
Salty water, gross.

1143
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,800
Soup is a drink.

1144
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,800
Oh no, I lose them.

1145
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,840
I expect my wife to just rappel onto the stage like,

1146
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,440
is somebody talking shit about soup?

1147
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,720
Except for a real chunky soup or a stew.

1148
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,840
Oh, fuck with a stew.

1149
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,360
Stop, everyone be quiet.

1150
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,360
That was the weirdest experience of my life.

1151
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,320
It sounded like an exact clump of 30 people.

1152
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,240
When Travis said stew, there were like a club.

1153
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,960
It's right here, what the fuck?

1154
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,400
There's like a stew club.

1155
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,080
Okay, there's like 20 people here sitting together that love stew.

1156
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,960
What's happening?

1157
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,840
Are you in a really specific club?

1158
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,400
The stew crew?

1159
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,960
Very good, Travis, very good.

1160
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,760
But one time, a very long time ago,

1161
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,200
there was an episode, Biggest Loser,

1162
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,880
where there was a boy named Bingo,

1163
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,320
and he had two eyes in his name.

1164
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,280
And Bingo, his mom wanted him to eat vegetables.

1165
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:23,720
So she blended them up and shoved them into meatloaf and hid them like a secret.

1166
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,560
And then he ate it and he hates vegetables so bad.

1167
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,000
And then she was like, well, Bingo, Bingo, guess what?

1168
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,480
You just ate a bunch of vegetables I hid in there.

1169
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,320
And this 10-year-old boy looked up at his mom and went...

1170
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,880
And she was like, didn't it taste good?

1171
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,080
And he said, don't ever do that again.

1172
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,720
So you could try that, just blend them on up.

1173
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,320
But then shit, then it's soup.

1174
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,040
When I was a kid, my mom told me this fish was chicken.

1175
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,840
All right.

1176
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,280
Oh yeah, I'm gonna do it.

1177
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:00,840
I'm gonna do it.

1178
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,680
Were you eating it like orange on silvers?

1179
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,520
Because that confuses me too sometimes.

1180
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,920
There's lots of food.

1181
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,600
I feel like if there's like, even if you don't like half of food,

1182
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,400
the other half is still like pretty good, a lot.

1183
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,640
I'm alive to this point.

1184
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,600
So yeah, sure.

1185
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,400
You know, life is short.

1186
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,360
Eat what you like.

1187
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,360
Everybody has a salad point, Jared.

1188
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,120
Everybody has a salad point.

1189
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,080
And that's the point at which you're hungry enough to eat salad.

1190
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:32,120
And my problem a lot of the time is I wouldn't let myself get to salad point.

1191
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,000
You know what I mean?

1192
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,960
I'd get to like hamburger point or cereal point,

1193
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,360
but I wouldn't let myself get to salad point.

1194
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,520
And then one day his arm got pinned between a rock and a mountain face.

1195
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:50,120
And after 128 hours, I would eat a salad if it would free me from my rock.

1196
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,640
He was trying to cut his arm off with a bowl full of salad.

1197
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,640
And he was like, I don't eat it.

1198
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,080
I don't eat it.

1199
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,640
Does that help?

1200
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,440
Kind of.

1201
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,080
Thank you, Jared.

1202
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,480
Tough, but fair.

1203
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:05,880
All right.

1204
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,720
Our final audience question.

1205
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,040
Hello.

1206
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,520
Hello.

1207
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,400
What is your name?

1208
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,040
Sydney.

1209
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:12,600
Sydney, hello.

1210
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,400
What is your question?

1211
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:22,040
So I am an actor and I have recently branched into narrating audio books as part of the hustle.

1212
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:28,440
And I've been mostly doing YA fantasy dystopian novels.

1213
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,240
And that's been great.

1214
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,120
All of them.

1215
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,680
All of them.

1216
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,240
All of them.

1217
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,120
All of the books.

1218
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:44,920
And I've started to be approached by authors of erotica novels who pay a lot of freaking money.

1219
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,480
Cool.

1220
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,200
Yeah.

1221
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,800
And I'm totally fine with doing it.

1222
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,160
Are you just bragging or do you have a question?

1223
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,360
I don't know.

1224
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,800
I don't know.

1225
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,880
My question is, if I'm an actor auditioning for a Shakespeare festival, I don't want the

1226
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,320
director to Google my name and say Diddling the Duke by Sydney Fulmer.

1227
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,880
So I need a pseudonym.

1228
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,440
And wondering if you guys would help me out.

1229
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,680
That is a tough line of work.

1230
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:17,160
I once, to help out my friend Chuck Tingle, I once read the book Slammed in the Butt by

1231
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,920
my handsome laundry detergent pod.

1232
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,160
And to my wife, I read it to my wife, I should have mentioned that earlier.

1233
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,240
That's tough, but fun, so I envy you.

1234
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,520
And I guess this is my way of saying, what about Maude Horny?

1235
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,280
That's pretty good.

1236
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,080
My top one right now is Anita Dixon.

1237
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,480
Okay.

1238
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,760
Yeah, I mean that's a little.

1239
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:51,880
You know, here's what I'll say, Sydney, is I think we've all kind of been in this position.

1240
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,280
Like, you know, I'd love to be an actor, but I'm worried that a potential director would

1241
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,280
Google me and found out I did a dumb podcast with my brothers, which is, I would say in

1242
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,560
a lot of ways, worse.

1243
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,840
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,400
Or that his TV show only lasted six episodes.

1245
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,120
Yeah.

1246
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,320
So far.

1247
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah, who knows?

1248
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,160
Don't torture yourselves.

1249
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:15,960
No, that's nothing.

1250
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:22,520
It's weird, I have the opposite situation where I am widely known as a narrator for

1251
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:28,680
sexual audio books, but I don't want fans of that work to know that I do a podcast with

1252
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,000
my brothers, which is why my real name is Jeremy Badbone.

1253
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,440
Wait, hold on, that would be the worst erotic pendant, Badbone.

1254
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,040
It's just my fucking name, dude.

1255
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,720
And my thing is, I don't want people to know that I'm related to the guy that eats

1256
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,720
amiibos for sexual gratification.

1257
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,240
It's a my thing.

1258
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:51,480
True.

1259
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,240
I want to end on that joke.

1260
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,040
Does that help?

1261
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,400
Yes, thank you.

1262
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,360
Okay, cool.

1263
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:07,960
It was, you have a very skewed view of what I do as my fucking artist.

1264
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,640
We can bring the house lights back down.

1265
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,840
Yes, thank you so much Salt Lake City for being so fun and welcoming and kind.

1266
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,920
You're the best.

1267
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,640
Make them go away, please, they're terrifying me.

1268
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,520
I'm just going to close my eyes until they're gone because I'm getting real freaked out.

1269
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,880
Thank you for coming to the show.

1270
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,160
We really appreciate you.

1271
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,440
Thank you to Paul Sabourin.

1272
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,240
Please turn off the house lights.

1273
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,840
Please not do anything.

1274
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,880
Paul Sabourin over there on the ones and twos.

1275
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,200
Make sure you check out Paul and Storm.

1276
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,880
Mixmaster Paul we call him sometimes.

1277
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,800
Mixmaster Paul, Paul and Storm is his band.

1278
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,760
Go listen to all their music.

1279
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,000
It's on Spotify so you can get it for free.

1280
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,800
You're welcome, Paul.

1281
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,280
Thank you to Sawbones and Schmanners who crushed it.

1282
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:04,040
Thank you to our families, our dad, our daddy.

1283
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:07,640
Thank you.

1284
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,520
Thank you to Amanda and Alice.

1285
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:15,080
Yeah, for helping us out and thank you to this beautiful venue whose name we would

1286
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,640
certainly goof up if we tried to say it out loud.

1287
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,360
So everyone count of one, two, three.

1288
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:20,840
Thank you.

1289
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,280
That's it.

1290
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,320
You got it, I guess.

1291
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,440
You live here.

1292
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,680
Also, thank you Caleb Cleveland for the absolutely beautiful poster.

1293
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,320
Wonderful posters.

1294
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,520
Yeah, there may be some more in the lobby if you didn't get one.

1295
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,560
There may still be some more.

1296
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,480
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these theme songs.

1297
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1298
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:39,880
Yes.

1299
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,280
Thank you Maximumfun.org, our podcast home.

1300
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,760
We are, we're not going to be hanging out after the show because we are going to go

1301
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,560
home to our fam- well, back to the hotel where our families are.

1302
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,160
Yes, I know.

1303
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,760
Because we love them.

1304
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,080
We do.

1305
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,240
We're great people and we're tired.

1306
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,080
We love you too, but in a different way.

1307
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,240
Yeah, seriously, we've never- we had no idea what to expect playing here because we've

1308
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,240
never played here before and you all have seriously been amazing.

1309
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,040
Thank you all so much.

1310
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,400
Here is-

1311
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,480
Here is a final Yahoo that was sent in by Alayna.

1312
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,280
Thank you Alayna.

1313
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,160
It's Yahoo Answers user Richard D. who asks,

1314
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:26,040
is Long John Silver's generally a good fish experience?

1315
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,800
He's just a mackerel.

1316
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,920
I'm Travis Mackerel.

1317
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,880
I'm Griffin Mackerel.

1318
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1319
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,720
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1320
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,600
Maximumfun.org.

1321
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,640
Comedy and culture.

1322
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,760
Artist owned.

1323
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,720
Listener supported.

1324
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:05,720
But welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

1325
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,440
So far the world's most boring wrestling podcast has been destroying the competition.

1326
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,200
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

1327
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,840
Wait, could it be?

1328
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,720
It's Tights and Fights, the perfect wrestling podcast.

1329
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:25,720
Tights and Fights is here to save us from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

1330
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,400
with hilarious conversations.

1331
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,040
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

1332
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,960
And joke about the finer points of people wearing spandex.

1333
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,960
What a match!

1334
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,840
And the Tights and Fights podcast will be back every week.

1335
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,240
Thursdays on Maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

1336
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:59,560
Please, these hosts have families.
