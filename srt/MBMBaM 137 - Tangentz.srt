1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,280
Let's just jump right into it, guys. Dear Abby's dead, and what do we do now?

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,520
Where do we go from here? There's lots of really terrible direction that we could take this goof,

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
but I'm actually, like, super sad. I feel like a pioneer is gone.

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:12,160
We do a super sad podcast, but a sad advice podcast is what shows up in our iTunes description.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Are we to mock the passing of a titan?

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,440
One of my favorite Dear Abby columns came from 1979. I thought this was the best way

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,400
to remember her before we moved on to some of the actual goofs. She received a letter

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,760
written by a fan of hers who was complaining about a gay couple who had moved into her

13
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,440
neighborhood, and the letter writer said that they have all sorts of strange company.

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,520
Men who look like women, women who look like men, blacks, whites, Indians.

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,160
Yesterday, I even saw two nuns go in there. How can we improve the quality

16
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,880
of this once respectable neighborhood? And her reply was, you could move.

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,000
I know, like in three words, she just took somebody apart in what usually takes us

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
15 to 20 hours to put together.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
That's good, man. She probably got shit like that all the time, right?

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh yeah.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
My black president, who I hate, is trying to take all my guns and liberties away.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,120
Why does that guy, that fella, if I may, I don't want to get too incendiary here,

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
but why does that fellow want to take my guns?

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,080
Right?

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Mine are first, listen, listen, listen. My AR-15 is a modern musket, and I use it for one,

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
let's shut up. I use it for one thing, and that's sport. And the sport I like is hunting the homeless.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,000
And so Obama wants it. I'm trying, it's a modern muskem.

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
I just want to know why does he actually want to take my real factual musket away?

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Why does he want to take my decorative musket?

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
I bought this blunderbuss at an auction. It is mine, damn it.

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
It wouldn't look as goo with a shorter capacity magazine, idiot.

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,120
Right, right. Keep your hands off my novelty cannon. Leave my musket alone,

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,360
and also stop trying to steal my musk. That's my fragrance. I worked on it with Jean-Pierre

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,720
LaPierre, and it has sandalwood and notes of tobacco and longing, and please don't steal my

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
musk. Please, it's my modern musk, Obama.

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
Does Obama want to take my stank away?

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Why does, please don't take my modern musk, Obama.

38
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,560
The Third Amendment defends our stank. Defends our right to hold stank without quartering

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,600
enemy soldiers. I think that's number three.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,160
I've seen a lot of hostage movies, and I've learned one thing, and that's if

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,720
someone is gathering up a bunch of guns, that means they're about to lead an assault.

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Oh my god, yeah.

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,800
They're like, I need all your guns. I'm going to rescue my nephew,

44
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,720
dumb Ricky, from the hospital that he's captive in.

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,440
I got to tell you, Justin, with the flu that you have, clearly,

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,320
and by the way, listeners, Justin has a flu, if you sounded just a little more belligerent,

47
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
you already have this sort of death rattle voice of Alex Jones,

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
so you could really drop some science on our listeners.

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
Hey, listen, everybody, do you own any gold?

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
Why not, you retards?

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
We trade goops for gold.

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,840
We trade goops for gold here on the My Brother, My Brother Me show.

53
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Hey, listen, coming up after the break, we got a brand new set of knives.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
These are pearl-handled.

55
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320
You're going to be able to pick up three of these for $17.99,

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
and after the break, a samurai sword also.

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
It's going to look real great on your mantle,

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
or your modern musket used to hang before Obama took it away.

59
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Now, let me ask, is Alex Jones also like a CBS-

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Alex Jones hosts the Knife Show.

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,080
Okay.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
Yeah, Alex Jones hosts the Knife Show.

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,800
I realized as I was doing that goof that I really don't know anything about Alex Jones,

64
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
except he thinks everybody should have a water purifier in their apartment,

65
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
and then I decided to transition seamlessly,

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
at least it was seamless until you pointed it out,

67
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,840
seamlessly into the guy that runs the Knife Show, which I love.

68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,640
I love that guy.

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,040
Okay.

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,960
You're going to be able to buy 70 knives for $30.

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
What is the situation?

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,520
That is a lot of knives for a very low amount of money.

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,480
I want to practice throwing knives into the river.

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,880
But I don't want to walk over and retrieve them.

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
Now, see, my joke was the river.

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
You should have let me finish my joke.

77
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
I think you were crossing-

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
Let me try again.

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,880
Ah, Jesus.

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm going to throw my knives, and I want to practice throwing knives into the river.

81
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
This episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me is sponsored by Theraflu,

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,600
which if you take too much of it, you are just going to fucking trip your ass right to the moon.

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,200
I live in a van down by the river.

84
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,160
You guys hear that one?

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,920
A van down by the river, Mount Folly.

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Travis, do you think we should-

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
Should we start...

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,760
A, should we take control of the podcast, and B, should we host some sort of intervention?

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,120
I would take control of the podcast, Griffin, but Obama took my guns away.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,800
You want control of this podcast, you're going to take it by force.

92
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,720
You can pry this podcast out of my cold, dead fingers.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
Uh, here's a question.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
I have a first date coming up.

95
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,080
I recently found out, however, that the girl I'm going out with

96
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,440
has a Twitter account where she live tweets all her first dates.

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh, what the fuck?

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,680
I haven't followed her, and my account isn't public,

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,400
but I do have the address and all signs point to her not knowing slash not caring that I can read it.

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
She's tweeted some about me already.

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
We're going to dinner and a concert.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,720
Should I discreetly follow the play by play and act accordingly,

103
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,760
or should I ignore it in hopes that I won't throw off my game?

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,040
That's tempted by Twitter.

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
Are you kidding me?

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
The fucking worst thing I've ever heard.

107
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,760
What are we doing?

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
So is this like she just does it, or like she's doing it as like a project?

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,120
It sounds like, it sounds like this is her social media presence.

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
Yeah, it's awful.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
You're the worst person.

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
But no, the worst person is the person who didn't include her username so I can follow her.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
Yeah, that's that's a great point.

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
I mean, I would I would do that.

115
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Don't get me wrong.

116
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,200
I would do this for entertainment, but it's like,

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,840
this is the same reason that you don't date a dark a Kardashian is because you don't want the

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
you don't want that to be your whole life.

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,200
You know, exactly right.

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,360
People forget how good you are at football or rapping.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,000
That's the only thing that's keeping me from doing that.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Other than the fact that I'm very happily engaged.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,360
And also I still don't know what and who the fuck those people are and what they did.

124
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,320
I would also like to point out I mean, I know that this wasn't the point of the question.

125
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,280
But this means that when this girl goes on a first date,

126
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
she's constantly like typing on her phone.

127
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
Maybe she goes on a lot of first dates.

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,760
At least you'd know like right when you like like like you

129
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll order for the lady.

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, coming out.

131
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,240
You accidentally like flip around and kind of mustard on to her and she

132
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,960
whips the phone out.

133
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
You're like, okay, I did deserve that one.

134
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,320
You got me.

135
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
Can you just be like having dinner with her and be like,

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,080
Hey, would you mind putting your goddamned phone away?

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
So I can like try and form a personal connection with you and maybe later get some touch

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
here in the wilderness of human civilization.

139
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Two people have found each other and you're marking the occasion by like

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
play by playing it tweet by tweet.

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,480
I also would suggest like, listen, I'm not one to to to poo poo something before

142
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
you even give it a shot.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
But this girl sounds awful.

144
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,040
Is that just me?

145
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,840
She doesn't sound like very, very cool or fun.

146
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
I mean, it could be cool and fun.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
We don't know unless we read those those tweets.

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Is it possible that she's dating you?

149
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it possible that she's dating you because like a one girl in the in that boy meets world

150
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,920
episode, Topanga, no, Cory's mom, no, the Alanis, Cory's dad, Morgan, Morgan one, Morgan

151
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,280
two, the one who had a songwriting career about Cory's brother, Larissa Olenek.

152
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Okay, right.

153
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
And she needed to date him again.

154
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,480
I feel like you guys are kind of I'm trying to get a black one, you know, the only one

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
there weren't the one black person on Boy Meets World.

156
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
No, to be fair, there were two.

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
There were two black people.

158
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
There was the teacher in season one who was not asked back.

159
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,440
Oh, shit.

160
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,040
Anyway, what were you saying, Justin?

161
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,520
There was one on there that dated Cory's brother.

162
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,120
Uh, and he treated her badly and she got a hit song out of it.

163
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay, I give up.

164
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Potato.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,760
I quit.

166
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm out.

167
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm out.

168
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,240
I quit.

169
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,960
Was it potato?

170
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,760
I think she's dead.

171
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
I think she's going out with you for more material.

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
That's what I'm saying to you.

173
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,240
This is what I'm dating you for material as somebody who works on and broadcasts pretty

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
much exclusively on the Internet for the way that they make money for a living.

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Why does this person feel like the medium for this broadcast has to be live?

176
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,400
Is their audience like, it's eight o'clock on Friday, time to tune into those tweets?

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
It's not like an old-timey radio show.

178
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
Why can't she fucking wait home and then write up a blog post and try and make an honest?

179
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Who remembers anything, though?

180
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
I don't remember anything that happens unless I tweet it.

181
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
And also, can you imagine being the dude who reads the field report later, where it's like,

182
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,080
so here's how it went down.

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,560
And you're like, oh, man, I thought I did good.

184
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
I did bad.

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
I thought I did a real good job.

186
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
I thought I did a real good job. Best way to build your presence is probably to bomb the

187
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,920
date, because then you're going to get a lot of people following you.

188
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,120
If your date's good or unremarkable, it's going to be a non-starter.

189
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,840
But like, if you completely bomb it.

190
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,440
Just compulsive, memetic behavior.

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:38,320
Yeah, unless you have the greatest date anyone has ever had ever.

192
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,080
Now, listen, you're really going to have to pull out all the stops and really commit to this.

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,560
But you could be Twitter famous for having the best date ever.

194
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Everybody has been trying to have the best date ever for a thousand years.

195
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Listen, I'm not saying the mods aren't stacked against him.

196
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm not saying it's not going to be an uphill climb.

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,480
He'll show up to the dinner with like a ukulele and he's like, that's for later.

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,480
He'll have two jackets so he can put one around you and also one over that puddle that you can step over.

199
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,840
The greatest first date ever was already had by John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale and Serendipity.

200
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
Let that ship sail.

201
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,600
You're not going to beat him.

202
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
Or recreate Serendipity, but don't tell her what you're doing.

203
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,880
Isn't that sort of against the spirit of the film Serendipity?

204
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,080
What if she hasn't seen Serendipity and her followers realize before she does

205
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,800
that he is just recreating the film Serendipity?

206
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
Holy shit, you have to secretly be tweeting about the date also

207
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,280
that you are goofing her on on a faux Serendipity switcheroo.

208
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh my god, that, I mean that's a little played out.

209
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
I got another question for you.

211
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,840
Okay.

212
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
I have a problem.

213
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,320
My boss is super long-winded and he's super on my case.

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,520
Some of his points are valid, but it's as if he will not stop speaking on his own volition.

215
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,160
He'll circle the same point over and over again, repeating things he said in past conversations

216
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,280
or just minutes ago.

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,640
I don't think I've ever had a one-on-one with him that was under 20 minutes.

218
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,400
They're usually closer to 40.

219
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
There's never more than five minutes worth of information.

220
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
He is my boss and I can't tell him to shut his goddamn yapper.

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,640
Need some tips and tricks.

222
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,680
That's from Karma Tornado.

223
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,200
I have never understood when people have this complaint.

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,080
It's like they don't realize that in the 40 minutes where your boss is telling you

225
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,360
things to do, you're not having to do anything.

226
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,080
That's a 40 minute.

227
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,800
You're trying to remember the lyrics to a Dave Matthews Band song.

228
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
That's right.

229
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
You don't have to work when your boss is talking to you.

230
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,080
It's like a little vacation in the middle of the day.

231
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,580
Yeah.

232
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,880
We used to try to get my friggin' algebra teacher to tell us about the Civil War.

233
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,360
Oh, man.

234
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Because if you could get him to talk about that, Mr. Sheets would go on a whole class

235
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
period on that topic.

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,640
I would also suggest this phrase.

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm going to stop you right there.

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
You've inspired me.

239
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,660
Okay.

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,040
I'd just be like, I have to finish this project now, Frank.

241
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,280
Thank you.

242
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,680
Listen, Frank, you've put the wind, the proverbial wind, beneath my wings.

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
I really need to fly now.

244
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
I feel like I need to fly on my own.

245
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Can you give me a coffee?

246
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,600
Are you my boss?

247
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
Because Justin forgot the question.

248
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Listen, Frank, this back's not going to rub itself.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
Listen, Frank, please just drive the cab, Frank.

250
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
Man, I really, I'm lost.

251
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,080
What are you, are you, did you take like cold medicine or dilaudid?

252
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
What are you on?

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
I took, here's what I'm on.

254
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm on Tamiflu, which I heard some hubbub about back when the superflu was like a real fear.

255
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
So I'm on Tamiflu.

256
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm on dextromethorphan.

257
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
That's not, you just, what?

258
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
That's going to decongest me.

259
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm on, Mucinex DM has that in it.

260
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,240
And it's got a cough suppressant and something to just loosen it up.

261
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,560
And then I'm on some ibuprofen and some zinc, which for me, when I have a hard hit of zinc,

262
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,840
it's like, it feels like my brain is a balloon and I have to pull its string down to earth

263
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,400
to grab the balloon and whisper in its ear.

264
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
I actually know that to be a fact.

265
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,080
That is not a goof that Justin is coming up with right now.

266
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,800
I remember that being a problem Justin had in high school.

267
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
The zinc gets you fucked up?

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
Zinc gets me messed up.

269
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
I'd really lose it on zinc.

270
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,000
I lose, I lose whole seconds.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,040
I fall out of time.

272
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,680
But this is like, why would you take it before we do the show instead of just playing through

273
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,840
the pain like fucking Curt Schilling in the bloody sock?

274
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
This could have been your bloody sock of comedy.

275
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
But this is weird.

276
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,560
I've also drank a lot of beers before this too, so I mean.

277
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,520
Am I the only one that is substantly, I'm actually, I'm sorry, I'm on crack,

278
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm on crack cocaine right now.

279
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,640
You smoked crack?

280
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Crack cocaine.

281
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
Hey, can you give us a Yahoo answer?

282
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Sure, I can.

283
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,760
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Matt R. Thank you, Matt R. It's by Yahoo answers user.

284
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,840
Is it any relation to Chris R?

285
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,400
Yes, it's Chris R's little brother.

286
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,360
Thank you, Matt R. It's by Yahoo answers user.

287
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,560
Rose is a vander.

288
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,480
Who asks, is it wrong that I sleep with a machete?

289
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,040
I sleep with a machete every night in case I wake up in the morning and I'm forced to survive.

290
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,200
I keep two lighters with me unless I'm at school and occasionally carry a dagger in my boot.

291
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,760
My mom is threatening to take away all my stuff

292
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,200
because having the weapons only feeds my fear or government.

293
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,520
That's probably fear of government.

294
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,760
But when I have my machete, I'm not afraid of anything.

295
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,080
She just can't see that something is going on in the world.

296
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,920
She doesn't understand that I don't feel like I'm here to have kids and start a family.

297
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,120
I feel like I'm here to fight and die for my loved ones.

298
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
I just don't see how it's wrong to be ready for a disaster.

299
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,320
I don't want to wake up and have the house falling apart and I die trying to get my stuff together.

300
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,160
Is he saying literally, like is he going to fight an earthquake with his magic machete?

301
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,840
Can I hit you guys with a proverb and you let me know if it seems wise to you?

302
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,920
Because in my head right now it seems really wise.

303
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
Throw your wisdom spaghetti against our wall and we'll tell you what's next.

304
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,440
Let me just see what it says.

305
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,080
And then we'll say, you wasted that spaghetti, what the fuck?

306
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm not saying you're going to want to like cross stitch this on something,

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,120
but I think there's a nugget of truth there.

308
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,960
The man who sleeps with a machete is a fool every night, but one.

309
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
Think about that for a second.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,480
You know what?

311
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,560
I am going to get that stitched onto a pillow.

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
Or your arm or something.

313
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Just like stitch it, I feel like.

314
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
I also, I don't want to get too deep here,

315
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
but I would also say that every morning when you wake up, you're forced to survive.

316
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,000
Damn it.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,480
Can I try?

318
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,520
Can I try?

319
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,360
The world is a little bit brighter when you carry a smile for a flashlight.

321
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,160
God damn it.

322
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,360
Can I try again?

323
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,400
Let me hit you with another one.

324
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Okay.

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
Okay.

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
Life is like a box of chalk.

327
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,560
Get out, we were doing so good.

328
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
We were doing so good.

329
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,080
Oh wait, okay.

330
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,960
How about this one?

331
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,440
Okay.

332
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
The man who sleeps with a machete is a cut above the rest.

333
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,800
That wasn't a proverb, it was just like a pun.

334
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,440
I think it was.

335
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
I think it was.

336
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,280
That sounds like the sign you put outside of your machete store.

337
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,680
Well, okay, to be fair, my machete store, a cut above, is thriving.

338
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
Thank you very much.

339
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
Can I try?

340
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah, you want to try again?

341
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520
There are holes in the floor of heaven and mama's tears are raining down.

342
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,440
What?

343
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
That's from the country song, Holes in the Floor of Heaven.

344
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,720
All right.

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,600
Feed Jake.

346
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
He's been a good dog.

347
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,920
Been my friend right through it all.

348
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,200
Don't take the girl.

349
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
Mama, God please, don't take the girl.

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
Can we just do Tim McGraw songs for this?

351
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
Listen, hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

352
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
That's John Michael Montgomery.

353
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
I don't mean to put you on blast, but it's John Michael Montgomery.

354
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,160
Guys, listen, prop me up beside the jukebox if I die.

355
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,720
Okay.

356
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,040
You know?

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,540
Water.

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,000
If you guys want to pursue this.

359
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
Let's all go down to the Dumas Walkers.

360
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,200
Trump's going to be able to procure a slaw dog, fries, and a bottle of ski.

361
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
And then you can bring it on out to your baby and ye.

362
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Three people just lost their shit.

363
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
Yeah, and all of them are in the Kentucky Head Hunters.

364
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
Okay, I'm so flattered.

365
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So flattered you guys are listening, by the way.

366
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
Okay.

367
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
I have friends in Austin.

368
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I went on a fucking doomsday preppers bender over the holidays.

369
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
And when I got back to Austin, I was hanging out with my group of friends.

370
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, and there's this show, Doomsday Preppers.

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,600
They build secret lairs and they buy a bunch of shit and prep for the end of the world.

372
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
Isn't that crazy?

373
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,040
And pretty much all of them either, the two responses I got were, we have that, yes.

374
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,680
Or we are in actively in the process of acquiring those things.

375
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
So you think that like everybody is secretly doomsday prepping?

376
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,200
I feel like I'm the only person who like when shit goes rough,

377
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,560
when shit starts to pop off, Quetzalcoatl makes his tardy appearance.

378
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,800
Like everybody on my street is just going to like iron shutters are going to slam over

379
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,280
their door and be like, where's our fucking iron shutters?

380
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
Why didn't we get those?

381
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
I went to New Year's Eve.

382
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,680
I went to dinner at like a fancy, very fancy restaurant.

383
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,400
And they did this thing where after we ate,

384
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,960
they took a razor or like a long, thin metal blade and scraped it over our table.

385
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,760
So we would not have to, our vision would not be besmirched by crumbs anymore.

386
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,920
Or I say that because if that's still going on in society,

387
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,480
like I think we have a pretty long way to fall before we're back to like machetes.

388
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
Like if that's the first thing that goes and then it's like,

389
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
I have to reach the adjacent table to get a bottle of ketchup.

390
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,520
Like that's our apocalypse.

391
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,160
Like I don't think we have so far to break down before that.

392
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,000
Like I think I'll see it coming.

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
Justin, the point you're trying to make right now seems so innocuous.

394
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,360
But what you're really saying is that you have become accustomed to a level of comfort

395
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,480
where if you don't have a man who scrapes the crumbs off of your table,

396
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,880
so you don't have to look at the crumbs from the expensive, delicious food you just ate,

397
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,040
you might as well be fucking dead.

398
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,720
You might as well just like, you might as well just lay down and wait to die.

399
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
That's not the exact point I was trying to make.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,800
But I mean, I think that that's fine.

401
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,600
If you, I would prefer someone next time scrape the crumbs off myself

402
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,080
because then it's like there's a clean table and a crummy guy.

403
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
And it's like, how did that happen?

404
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,880
I don't have a good excuse.

405
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
But did you come into this restaurant with crumbs?

406
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,800
You gotta use a soft bristled broom.

407
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Sir, please don't touch the table.

408
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,040
Please.

409
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
Please sir, we have another party coming in in a couple hours.

410
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,040
Can we get a giraffe in here to lick these crumbs off of him?

411
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,600
Thank you.

412
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
We have a self mess.

413
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,640
Can someone please open up the guest gutter and dump him in, please?

414
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Someone with a BMI over 10 is in the restaurant.

415
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
Can we have them removed, please?

416
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
I really am, like, I feel like-

417
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,160
They're ensloppining the whole, the whole atmosphere.

418
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
A machete seems just like an, like an awfully dangerous thing to sleep with.

419
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
How, why is it so much, okay.

420
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,880
Okay, why is it, you know what, I have an axe within reach of the bed,

421
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,120
but it's not in the bed unless you count, I mean, unless you count the battle axe.

422
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,520
Well, in his defense, in his defense, your axe doesn't have a vagina on it.

423
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,200
Right, correct.

424
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,320
Sorry, let me be, I didn't read that paragraph of the Yahoo answer,

425
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
but his machete has a fake vagina on it.

426
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,680
We've been doing this show for too long officially, I think.

427
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,640
Can we do a show about normal people, normal things that they do?

428
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
I would say, Griffin, I would say that it is okay to throw stones at people

429
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,920
who have sexual relationships with weaponry.

430
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,160
Well, it's not safe, certainly.

431
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
I'd throw stones at other people before I'd throw stones at people

432
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
who are in love with an axe, certainly.

433
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,760
Wait a second, do you think that's the, oh my God,

434
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,880
all of like the crazy, like crazy NRA gun appreciation day,

435
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,040
do you think it's really because they are fucking these guns literally?

436
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,240
They are put, if you push two pistol barrels together,

437
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,680
man, and just wedge something in there, it's gonna feel phenomenal.

438
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,080
You listen to me, Bula.

439
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,880
Oh, man.

440
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
I will never let them take you.

441
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,720
You are my special, special somebody.

442
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,680
I can't tell if you're trying to do Alex Jones, but.

443
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,440
I don't know who that is, I don't know what he sounds like breathing.

444
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,400
I know he's a nut bar and I know he thinks he was a hoax.

445
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
You listen to me, Bula, I'm gonna have sex with your barrel

446
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,080
while I tell you that the second tower could never have come down

447
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
because metal doesn't melt that way.

448
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm gonna cock my gun and then I'm gonna pull back the hammer thing

449
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
that gets it ready to shoot.

450
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,160
I have a friend that I will hang out with a lot and we have a lot of fun.

451
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
Do you want me to do this for you?

452
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,520
Let me try it in a different tense.

453
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
Because this seemed very sort of forward-looking.

454
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,280
That was past perfect participle present perfunctory.

455
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,960
I have a friend that I hang out with a lot and we have a lot of fun when we go out.

456
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,400
The problem is whenever I say something funny or come up with a goof,

457
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
he will repeat what I just said back to me verbatim.

458
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,160
Not only that, he won't add anything to the joke and he will repeat what I said

459
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,560
to other friends and take full credit for it.

460
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,320
Is it awkward or is it funny?

461
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,560
Is it awkward because I don't want to call him out for it,

462
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
but sometimes it gets a little annoying.

463
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,080
Should I tell him to write his own jokes or should I just suck it up?

464
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
It's from Shafted and Savannah.

465
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,480
Is he like saying, hey guys, did you hear what he just said?

466
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,880
He said and then repeating the joke or literally just turning to the group

467
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
and saying it again.

468
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,400
It sounds like he's just literally saying them right like he's mirroring them.

469
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,680
But he's learning.

470
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,320
When he first started hanging out with us, he was an amorphous blob,

471
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,680
but he's starting to gain characteristics similar to my own.

472
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,760
I don't know, man.

473
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,760
I think if you call this dude out, he's going to give you an invasion of the body snatchers

474
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,280
style owl and then I think he's going to turn to Ash and return to his home planet.

475
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:24,640
He'll have surpassed you and he'll take your words, your thoughts.

476
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,520
He'll steal them.

477
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
Does this man have a slug attached to his brain?

478
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
Is there a slug, a visible slug?

479
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,080
Is there a visible slug coming through like a part in his hair?

480
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,320
Does he have any spines?

481
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
Can anyone else see him but you?

482
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,720
Are you imaginary perhaps?

483
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,200
Does he ask to borrow some of your clothes and then all of your clothes?

484
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,680
Are you two ever in the same room at the same time?

485
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,320
Does your mother often confuse him for you?

486
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,000
How did you internet, Fignant?

487
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,240
That's amazing.

488
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
That's amazing, Fignant.

489
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Fig Newton, you're incredible.

490
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Juice Newton, you're a great singer.

491
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,560
That's a personal message from me to Juice Newton.

492
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,680
Oh, God.

493
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,920
The title of this episode is Tangents with a Z.

494
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
Did you guys have a good week?

495
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Let's just, let's pause.

496
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,000
Take a break.

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,360
Take a brother break.

498
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,560
Just a quick brother break.

499
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
We don't want to take these anymore.

500
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,920
So Justin could huff some more zinc.

501
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm just trying to get it together on home on my friend.

502
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,600
Let's, I think we should go to the money zone.

503
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
Yeah, this is so far has been something that we should be paid for.

504
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,080
I look back at the past half hour and think,

505
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,120
I just, I demand recompense for this has happened.

506
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
And I bet you and I were thinking the same thing.

507
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
These guys are great.

508
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,920
I just wish I could pay for what's happening to me.

509
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,160
Don't put a penny into the port at the bottom of your iPod because it'll break.

510
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah.

511
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,040
And also don't want more than pennies.

512
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,960
Yeah, I need dollars.

513
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
Dollars and cents.

514
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,640
That's all we're about.

515
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,080
No, not cents.

516
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
I want, and no, cents like musk because Obama stole all mine.

517
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,720
So if someone can steal me, send me a musk that I can use for my variance.

518
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,800
Have you ever thought about how musk sounds like musket?

519
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
And how musket sounds like musketoon, which is like a shorter barreled musket.

520
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,400
I got a pretty good goof coming up for you 20 minutes ago, Griffin.

521
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,080
I think you're really going to have liked it.

522
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,640
Most people aren't aware that this podcast is cyclical.

523
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
Yeah, this whole podcast is a haiku.

524
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,360
Actually, the last podcast will end with our birth.

525
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,440
It'll be really weird.

526
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
Like a snake eating its own tail.

527
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,280
My brother, my brother and me.

528
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,000
It's going to be Mobius strip.

529
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Nope, wait, money zone.

530
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
Happy birthday and anniversary.

531
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,520
I hope we were paid twice for this message to Arthur Gorka and that's happy anniversary

532
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,560
of your birth.

533
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,880
Happy anniversary of your birth and your agreement to stay with each other forever.

534
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,960
That's from Lindsay Wood.

535
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,880
She loves Arthur very much, one would assume.

536
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,800
And it's his birthday and the day that their special commitment was born.

537
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,200
So we have-

538
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,400
What is that, you ask?

539
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,960
We don't know.

540
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,160
Love?

541
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,280
Love?

542
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,080
What am love?

543
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Am just in love?

544
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
Am just in no love, yes.

545
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
Am just in touch love?

546
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,040
Oh my God.

547
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,560
I promise we didn't, during the money zone break, we didn't take chunky bong rips.

548
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,320
We did all take a fuckload of Zinco.

549
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,560
Griffin, who am feeling?

550
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
Justin, can you guide us through these choppy waters?

551
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,440
Yeah.

552
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,960
Why is Justin at the wheel?

553
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:53,840
Oh man, I watched Blue Velvet last night and at the moment where Dennis Hopper is screaming,

554
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
baby wants to fuck.

555
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:06,960
And he takes a segment of Isabella Rossellini's robe and manipulates her genitals with it.

556
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
I was thinking to myself, that seems unsanitary.

557
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
He should have stopped at ExtremeRestraints.com.

558
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,920
It's an adult superstore, so you don't have to fuck Isabella Rossellini with your hands

559
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
wrapped in robe.

560
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,680
Imagine what other classic movies would be like if they had extreme restraints in them.

561
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,160
Yeah, you could just go get a woman's fetish uniform.

562
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,240
Baby likes to fuck, well get her something that's appropriate for that.

563
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
Get her nurse perverse.

564
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,040
It's a beautiful nurse's costume with some really tasteful covers over her nipples and

565
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,120
it looks great, very sexual.

566
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
Is it cotton?

567
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
If it's not cotton, I can't wear it.

568
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know, but I would assume it's all natural.

569
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,800
It's probably edible too, I don't know.

570
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,200
It's made of fruit roll-ups.

571
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,080
It's also a silicone, there's also a silicone deluxe come-through penis plug.

572
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,600
So when you don't want to take the time to take your plug out, you can come I guess through

573
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,320
it or around it.

574
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm not exactly sure of the physics, but what I am sure of is that you're going to save

575
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,560
a lot of money.

576
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,040
You come into an envelope and then you mail it to your lover.

577
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,320
Please don't do that to us.

578
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,720
You mail it to yourself in the past and you're like, how?

579
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,440
When did this happen?

580
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
That's how you patent your comb.

581
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,840
That's how you patent your comb.

582
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,280
That is actually in most courts as long as there is a postmark on it.

583
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
That will hold up in court.

584
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,560
I'm sorry, I couldn't be the father.

585
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,720
But don't wait too long because then that semen will grow into a baby as we all know.

586
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,640
You'll get another mailbox baby.

587
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,080
God, it's such a shame, isn't it?

588
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,960
Isn't it such a shame, these mailbox babies?

589
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Thanks to ExtremeRestraints.com, I have seen more manipulated, twisted, plugged dicks than

590
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,800
I have normal dicks.

591
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,640
I no longer have a barometer for what a regular penis looks like.

592
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,000
So often have I seen them caged and pinned like a wild boar.

593
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,520
I didn't know until we started perusing the JPEGs on Extreme Restraints, I didn't know

594
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,720
about the secret sex hole that you have on the back of your head.

595
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
It's called your Gorka.

596
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,800
No, no.

597
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,520
No, I don't think it's called your Gorka.

598
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,120
So our friend James Medina at Extreme Restraints sent me a list of some suggested products

599
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,760
to talk about.

600
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,800
Oh my god, the best one is the last one and it is the Kinky Kyle Head and Body Masturbator,

601
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,760
which I thought at first when reading the title was like a suit that you wore that masturbated

602
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
your whole body at the same time.

603
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh my god.

604
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,120
What's up 2013?

605
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,720
But it's not.

606
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,880
It is in fact a full body that you use to masturbate.

607
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,160
Oh okay, I like it.

608
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,960
That's just sex.

609
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
And he has eyes, which is weird.

610
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,240
So search Kinky Kyle Head and Body Masturbator at ExtremeRestraints.com.

611
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,640
If you say that sex is just using someone else's body to masturbate, is that the creepiest thing?

612
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,440
Basically a pretty terrible thing to say out loud.

613
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I do want to say though that the best thing I've ever said out loud to counterbalance

614
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,000
that terrible thing your girlfriend said is that you can save 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com

615
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,840
if you enter the coupon code MIDDLEST as you're checking out.

616
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
You're going to save 20%.

617
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,080
If you get off, let's get serious.

618
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,360
If you get off, sorry, when you get off using one of these fun products,

619
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,200
it's basically going to be because of us, because of the savings that we've just passed along to you.

620
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes, you're welcome.

621
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,520
20% of your orgasm belongs to us.

622
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Yeah, so if you could scoop up approximately 20% of the,

623
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,480
toss that bitch in an envelope, maybe send it our way.

624
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
P.O. Box, what is the number Justin?

625
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,080
Sorry?

626
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,600
The P.O. Box.

627
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,160
P.O. Box 54, like the car, hunting to West Virginia, 25706.

628
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,840
Please don't, please.

629
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,920
Don't send us an envelope of your cum.

630
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Stop it.

631
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Stop now, this isn't funny anymore.

632
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh, check it out.

633
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
What if they seal the envelope with it and we'd never know?

634
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,480
Oh, what if they've already done that?

635
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,720
What if I'm going to quit forever and I don't just mean this show, but life?

636
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
I don't have the strength to go on anymore.

637
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
How about a Yahoo answer?

638
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,200
Extremetist.com, KuboKubo Middle is 20%.

639
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,720
Hit me, Griffin.

640
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I have a question about pubes and a question about porn.

641
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,800
I'm worried that following up that whole seg with one of these-

642
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah, maybe not.

643
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,480
Maybe something about-

644
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,640
Ira Ray sent this in.

645
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
Do you have anything about Sanford and Son?

646
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
I don't.

647
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray.

648
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,600
Thank you, Ira.

649
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,080
It's by Yahoo!

650
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,880
And it's by Tyler.

651
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,160
Are you Ira Ray?

652
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,600
Who wants to know?

653
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,360
It's a tag, it's a stinger.

654
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
It's not a joke, it's a stinger.

655
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,080
It's an audio stinger.

656
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,400
Yahoo!

657
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,840
And it's by Tyler asks, for school, we have to make a pretend restaurant

658
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,040
and I need a catchy slogan.

659
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
My restaurant's name is Tyler and Kyle's Totally Bodacious Rib Shack.

660
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
I'm sorry, one more time.

661
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,400
My restaurant's name is Kyle and Tyler's Totally Bodacious Rib Shack.

662
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
We have seafood and barbecue.

663
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,600
I needed to know so much more about K&T's TBRS.

664
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,520
Kyle and Tyler's Totally Bodacious Barbecue and Fish.

665
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,640
Where the food is as good as it looks.

666
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,840
It is as bodacious as it looks.

667
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,480
It is as bodacious as you may have heard.

668
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,960
As bodacious as you believe in your heart that it is.

669
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,280
We are not shitting you about the bodacious.

670
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,040
Come eat some fucking torsos.

671
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
Tykel and Kyler.

672
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,600
Food?

673
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm sorry, what were their names?

674
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,480
And when did it go from being an awesome rib shack

675
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
to being like a highfalutin, like micro food kind of place?

676
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Have you been to that new coffee shop?

677
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,360
It's totally shade grown, organic.

678
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,280
They only serve one cup a day.

679
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
It's called Tykel and Kyler's.

680
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,320
They also have gift sets.

681
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,300
Fuck.

682
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,560
Why is this a thing that your school's making you do?

683
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Do you think this guy's teacher is like,

684
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,520
I can't wait to get out of the fucking teaching biz.

685
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,480
Got to open up my own restaurant, but I just have no ideas.

686
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,160
Griffin, I know that people are always talking

687
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,920
about us talking too much about Dawson's Creek on this show,

688
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
but it seems like a fine time to bring up

689
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,880
Dawson's dad's restaurant concept.

690
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
For those not familiar with the show,

691
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
for literally two seasons of this program,

692
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,000
Dawson's dad's job was to build a model of a restaurant

693
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
where everyone wore scuba gear.

694
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,360
That was his profession.

695
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,560
And it wasn't a joke?

696
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
No, it wasn't a gag.

697
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,840
That was his goddamn J.O.B.

698
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,080
Every time they panned this poor,

699
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,440
formerly the Flash motherfucker,

700
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,680
it's him putting a helmet on a little guy

701
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,280
in a scuba-themed restaurant.

702
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,520
But he also had his other restaurant,

703
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,240
which was Dawson's dad's 100% safe car floor ice cream.

704
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,680
Sorry, spoiler alert.

705
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,160
Spoiler alert, season four, Dawson's Creek.

706
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
If you haven't watched it, I apologize for the spoiler.

707
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,680
I think we've talked about this before.

708
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,560
I think I edited it out

709
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
because I was really worried about spoiling Dawson's Creek.

710
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,920
What's awesome about the scuba-themed restaurant

711
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,520
is that later in the show,

712
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,760
Dawson's family did in fact have a fish restaurant,

713
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,080
but had none of the...

714
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,320
There was no even tip of the hat to its more scuba-themed...

715
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,680
There was apparently an off-camera conversation

716
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,720
between Mitch and Gale,

717
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,520
where Gale's like,

718
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,800
listen, Mitch, this is the dumbest goddamn idea ever.

719
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,160
You know what people like?

720
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
Fish.

721
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,920
You know what people hate?

722
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
Helmets and tubes.

723
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,480
I'm not doing this with you anymore.

724
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,040
Let's get a divorce.

725
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,840
Sydney often tries to convince me

726
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,080
that Dawson's Creek is actually the story of Mitch and Gale.

727
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,120
That everyone else is ancillary.

728
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,120
Well, I mean...

729
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,720
Think about it.

730
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,920
It really makes a lot of sense.

731
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,280
Categorically, it does it.

732
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
I mean, if you think about...

733
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,360
She...

734
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,760
That's her time to regroup, anyway.

735
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,400
I have recently taken a listen to audiobooks

736
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,120
to help pass the time during life's four menial tasks.

737
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,760
Once I complete listening to one,

738
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,280
can I claim that I have read it?

739
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,040
Or do I tell people I have only listened

740
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,760
to every single word over the course of 10 hours?

741
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,160
That's from Wondering in Woodstock.

742
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,640
Travis, I bet you have an opinion about this.

743
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,320
I do, and it's awful.

744
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,840
The ship is still on its steady course.

745
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,480
Yes.

746
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,200
Yep.

747
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,920
The problem is, yes, you can say that you read it,

748
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,520
but you'll have to 100% of the time follow that up by saying,

749
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
well, I mean, I listened to it.

750
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,960
And so it's better just not to bring it up.

751
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,040
You're getting the information in your fucking brain.

752
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,960
You would be amazed.

753
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,840
But you'd be amazed, though.

754
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,320
I've had this argument with people before,

755
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,760
because I agree with you, Griffin.

756
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
But the number of people who say,

757
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,920
no, taking in audio information and visual information

758
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,360
is completely different, and you don't hold it the same way.

759
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,040
Now, I will say this.

760
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,600
I could see why having somebody read it to you

761
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,440
tends to put their inflection on things.

762
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,720
And you don't hear it in your own voices in your head.

763
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,840
You hear it through them.

764
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,200
So I could see where that would affect it a little bit.

765
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,960
But you're still getting the story.

766
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,240
You're still getting the words.

767
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,800
You're still getting fucking smarter.

768
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
I don't understand why these people have to stand.

769
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,560
You're trying to do better.

770
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
And they're like, mm, but it's indifferent.

771
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,840
Fucking, man, fuck those Beekmans.

772
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,480
You don't need that.

773
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,040
All right.

774
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,480
I don't think any of these Beekmans

775
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,960
are ever going to quiz you on a-

776
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,200
How did the paper feel in your hands then?

777
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
Describe the textile element.

778
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,120
I mean, how is it different?

779
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,480
I mean, it seems to me like the same kind of progression

780
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,200
of reading a book or getting it on a Kindle.

781
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,040
Except, hey, guess what, idiots?

782
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,360
I can listen and do other stuff at the same time.

783
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,440
You can listen to that book and read another book.

784
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,560
Double books.

785
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,840
Yeah, you know what you can't do?

786
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,360
Read a book and drive a car.

787
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,680
Yeah.

788
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,840
I can listen to the book on tape and drive a car

789
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,720
at the same time.

790
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,240
Who's smart now, Beekman?

791
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,800
Me.

792
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,160
Now, let me ask you the slightly more complex question.

793
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,360
What if the audio version is abridged?

794
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,760
Oh, well, then it doesn't count.

795
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
It does, though, because when you read a book,

796
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
you're automatically abridging it,

797
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,720
because everybody knows that when you read a book,

798
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,640
you're really only reading every other paragraph.

799
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,920
Tops.

800
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Tops.

801
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,400
You'll read a sentence and be like,

802
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,440
John woke up and looked outside, and you're like,

803
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,520
well, he's about to describe some fucking trees

804
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
for like 200 words, so I'm just going to go ahead

805
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,960
and skip around and look for the word tits.

806
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,000
You know, when I was in elementary school

807
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,880
and I had to read books for the Accelerated Reader program

808
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,080
and then take quizzes on it, I would read every other page.

809
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,400
Yeah.

810
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
And I aced every single one of those tests.

811
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,000
Sure, because you're a very lucky man.

812
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
Well, I got the basic gist of Treasure Island.

813
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,240
Now, maybe I was confused as to where some characters came from.

814
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,720
Yeah.

815
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,560
But I knew who the characters were.

816
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,600
And it was fifth grade.

817
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,960
It's not like they were, like, really in-depth quizzes.

818
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,760
It was like, what was the name of the evil pirate?

819
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,960
You're like, Long John Silver.

820
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,360
I learned that in the first, like, 10 pages.

821
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,000
What if Travis did that and became the first dude

822
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,400
to ever understand Finnegan's Wake?

823
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,280
Like, everyone's like, oh, shit, yeah, every other page.

824
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,120
Oh, it was like a codex.

825
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,960
Okay, you had to read every other page,

826
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,760
and then they connected.

827
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,120
Unless one of the pages you were skipping

828
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,160
had the word tits on it.

829
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,560
You quickly scan.

830
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,880
Yeah, that's why the Kindle is great,

831
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,600
because you can just, like, search for the word tits.

832
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,960
Control F, yeah.

833
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,720
Sometimes they don't say tits, though.

834
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,560
Sometimes they say, like, titties.

835
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
James Joyce used them interchangeably.

836
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,480
So if you search one,

837
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,400
you're really going to be missing out on, like, half the book.

838
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
That's why it's better just to type tit,

839
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,480
and it'll pull up both.

840
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,680
No, because then you could get, like, title.

841
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,760
Oh, that's true.

842
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,200
And nobody wants to waste time.

843
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,120
Or, like, titular, and then you're like,

844
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,600
oh, damn, it's not what I thought it meant.

845
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,080
Or titay, which is sexy.

846
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,840
It's not sexy or something.

847
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,720
I forgot about, yeah, James Joyce also peppered.

848
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,640
Peppered his words with that.

849
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
Actually, he coined the term titay.

850
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,120
Actually, the only character in Finnegan's Wake

851
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,560
that uses the term titay is Meth-Daryl,

852
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,640
and everyone knows that you could skip

853
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,080
all the Meth-Daryl sections

854
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,720
and really take just as much away from the novel.

855
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,320
That's why when you search it on your Kindle,

856
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,280
you got to do the minus sign, Meth-Daryl,

857
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,400
so that way it will edit Meth-Daryl out of the book for you.

858
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,840
Did you know you can do that with Kindle?

859
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,680
Just edit out whole sections of the book.

860
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah, books are the fucking worst.

861
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
Yeah, yeah, I get it, books.

862
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,600
You had your chance.

863
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,080
If I could shoot-

864
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,840
Maybe if you had pictures and you talked.

865
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,040
Oh, wait, that's movies.

866
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,640
Get the fuck out, books.

867
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,240
I read books for the first, like, 16 years

868
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,400
I was alive before computers and everything.

869
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,480
And I really feel like books have had their chance.

870
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,120
At this point, if I'm not reading anymore,

871
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,720
isn't that really their fault?

872
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,840
Like, didn't they have a chance to get their claws into me?

873
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,320
Let me ask you guys a next level question.

874
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,120
Okay, me.

875
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,760
Okay, so we agree that when you listen to the book on tape,

876
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,040
you can say you read it, right?

877
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,680
Yeah.

878
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,320
What if you watch a really, like,

879
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,160
accurate movie version of a book?

880
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,680
Sure, I don't-

881
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
You say you read it.

882
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,880
I think if-

883
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,160
I see, I think with a movie,

884
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,600
you run a real risk of saying the one thing that, like,

885
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,800
lets the person know that you only saw the movie.

886
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,040
Like, I think that that's a long distance scam.

887
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,880
So, but like, with Game of Thrones,

888
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,600
where they made, like, 10 episodes of one book,

889
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,160
that's pretty accurate, you know?

890
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,840
Like, I feel like that covers it.

891
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,880
Yeah, but I think in Game of Thrones,

892
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,760
you, is a rare example of where you should be more embarrassed

893
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
to have read the book, all right?

894
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,200
Because you're saying instead of actually seeing

895
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,840
some real juggerugs on TV-

896
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,400
Oh my God.

897
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,440
I'd rather read-

898
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
I was coined by James Joyce.

899
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,920
I'd rather read a fat bearded man tell me about this.

900
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
I don't know, cause that fat bearded man

901
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,000
can weave a tapestry of adjectives to describe-

902
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,520
The words he creates discuss titties.

903
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,080
He fucking goes centimeter by centimeter

904
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,400
describing every bump, every nook and cranny of the areola.

905
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,520
He gets in there-

906
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,160
George R.R. Martin is a man who knows his nipples.

907
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,600
He gets in on and around those titties.

908
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,960
He gets you inside the mind of the titty.

909
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,040
Yeah, you really know what the titty's thinking,

910
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,960
and I mean, you can feel-

911
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,280
Justin, Justin, titty.

912
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,360
You can feel the lactation.

913
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm saying sometimes when you read them,

914
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
you can really feel that kind of thing.

915
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,640
If his descriptions of breasts are so exquisite,

916
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,200
you would almost swear they were edible

917
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,440
because those are the only other things

918
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
that get his attention in that fashion.

919
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,360
It activates the same part of,

920
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,440
well, not everyone's brain, but certainly George R.R. Martin's.

921
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,840
The only thing George R.R. Martin likes

922
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,680
is food and breasts and ways to avoid walking.

923
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,120
If he can do any of those three, he is stoked.

924
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,560
I don't know him personally.

925
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,840
He's probably a very sweet man.

926
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,480
Who knows a lot about boobies.

927
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,960
He does.

928
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,800
I mean, he writes, he can write a boob.

929
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,640
That's all I'm saying.

930
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,200
He can write a boob.

931
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,680
I do find it weird when there are entire chapters

932
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,640
from the perspective of tits.

933
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,120
Like that seems a little excessive.

934
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,600
It's like the tits heaved up and down

935
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,040
and they didn't see much until they got out to fuck.

936
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,840
And then the kings died.

937
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,640
There's that one point in the book

938
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,480
where it tangented off

939
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,440
to a time when George R.R. Martin saw some boobs

940
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,840
and it had nothing to do with the story he was telling,

941
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,280
but it took over from the narrator.

942
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,480
It was the summer of 75 in the back of my dad's chevillette.

943
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,360
The blood of Reggie Stark splashed onto the boobs

944
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,560
and then they knew that the king had perished.

945
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,440
And there was not a dry boob in the house that day.

946
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,720
Not a dry boob as all the boobs were covered in tears

947
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,960
of the families that had lost men that day.

948
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,720
And House Stark always knew that winter was boobing.

949
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,560
So it was so many men were lost that day.

950
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,880
So many hearts broken just below the breasts.

951
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,040
You can read more in the final chapter

952
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,280
of the Game of Thrones series titled

953
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,240
A Barrel of Jugs.

954
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,440
My girlfriend and I recently got engaged.

955
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,640
Dragon tits.

956
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,040
Sorry, you going home?

957
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,840
Dragon tits.

958
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,360
A song of ice and fire and boobs.

959
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,840
Okay.

960
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,600
My girlfriend and I recently got engaged.

961
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,040
We started planning our wedding.

962
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,200
We're having a problem filling out our guest registry.

963
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,280
Each of us have lived in the registry.

964
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,920
What did I say?

965
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,400
Guest.

966
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,900
Guest.

967
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,380
We're having a problem filling out our gift.

968
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,260
Should I start at the beginning?

969
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,460
Would that be easier to edit?

970
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,100
No, it sort of plays into the narrative thread of this podcast

971
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,780
of you being whacked out of your mind on a single,

972
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,620
off of a single mineral.

973
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,620
They lived alone before moving in together.

974
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,460
So we already own a lot of stuff.

975
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,180
What should we include on our registry

976
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,500
to ensure a life of wedded bliss?

977
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,460
And that's from wanting some free shit.

978
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,940
I think you are missing the point.

979
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,900
Wait, sir.

980
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,220
The point here is not to get stuff you don't already have.

981
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,700
It's to get the new awesome adult version

982
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,900
of the childish shit you bought for 20 bucks at Walmart.

983
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,140
Right.

984
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,340
Like everybody's got the economy class of stuff.

985
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,700
This is your chance to say,

986
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,020
hey, maybe, you know, Spurge and buy me the fancy iron.

987
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,940
Everybody's got the coffee maker

988
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,340
that will just literally just tip over

989
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,260
and spill coffee all over the ground.

990
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,140
And if you let brew more than three cups at a time,

991
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,340
everybody's got that already.

992
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,020
But maybe these people are into that.

993
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,700
Maybe these people are into shabby chic

994
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,940
and we can't, you don't want to take that from them.

995
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,740
You know?

996
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,900
Well, if that's the case, then you need to widen,

997
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,140
widen your mind.

998
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,540
Yeah.

999
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,820
And you know, go like do a gift registry at like Home Depot

1000
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,860
and get some tools.

1001
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,020
I guarantee you don't have tools.

1002
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,100
Listen, you can't, you're so young.

1003
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,780
You can't already have,

1004
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,540
if you already have all the material possessions

1005
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,180
you want right now,

1006
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,100
what are you going to distract yourself

1007
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,260
with when the magic wears off, you know?

1008
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,820
Getting a really bad fight.

1009
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,020
Why'd you want to surf for toys?

1010
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,820
They get in a really bad fight

1011
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,180
where they break all the shit that they have.

1012
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,180
Oh, that's true.

1013
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,020
You know, I have a few different options here.

1014
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,500
My wife and I ran into something similar to this.

1015
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,980
We actually had people buy us parts of our honeymoon.

1016
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,580
We had a registry where you could buy like dinner one night

1017
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,660
or one night in our hotel room or whatever.

1018
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,700
Uh, so you, so we did that.

1019
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,340
Um, I also had friends,

1020
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,700
our friends John and Rissy went the opposite direction

1021
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,820
and they registered at Target for shit they didn't need.

1022
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,020
So we ended up buying them a copy of Trivial Pursuit

1023
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,420
and a large jar of nacho cheese

1024
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,100
because they had registered for it.

1025
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,740
Now what's to make you think they don't need that?

1026
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,580
I mean, they certainly consumed it.

1027
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm sure.

1028
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,640
Right.

1029
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,220
And I'm just saying that like,

1030
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,980
if you look around your house,

1031
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,460
I'm sure that you could use some new bath towels

1032
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,300
or, you know, something like that.

1033
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,820
You, you probably are not thinking

1034
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,380
about all the new shit you could get.

1035
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,060
I think we're just gonna ask for money to like get a house.

1036
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,020
But like, if people don't give us enough money at the wedding

1037
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,420
to pay for an entire house, then we don't let them leave.

1038
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,500
Here's the problem though, Griffin.

1039
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,140
That's not a bad idea, but there are people in this world

1040
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,740
that like for some reason are just so opposed to giving money

1041
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,700
that you have to give them some kind of option.

1042
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,060
Everything that I've read, everybody I've talked to is like,

1043
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,060
you need to go and register for at least like three things.

1044
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,820
Oh, we've thought, we, yeah, yeah.

1045
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,540
I mean, we thought of that.

1046
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,900
You can either give us money for a house

1047
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,060
or the keys to the house that you got us.

1048
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,540
Uh-huh.

1049
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,260
We're kind of house crazy.

1050
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,020
Or just keys to a house.

1051
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,340
It's fun.

1052
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,700
And then we have to find it.

1053
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,300
It's like the Goonies.

1054
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,620
Why don't you register for some guns?

1055
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,420
Yeah, because Obama's gonna take them

1056
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,220
before they can even like get married.

1057
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,820
That would be terrible.

1058
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,780
I love video games.

1059
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,380
Can you register for toys?

1060
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,180
I think so.

1061
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,900
Yeah, you can.

1062
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,940
It's just like, you're not, the people who are gonna buy you

1063
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,660
things off your registry, I think one, you lose out on,

1064
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,620
by not having items in your registry, you lose out on people

1065
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,900
who aren't gonna enter, like people who aren't gonna attend,

1066
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,420
but will go through the easy, like few clicks to send you a gift

1067
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,940
to let you know they're thinking about you.

1068
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,540
So like, if you look around at your household goods,

1069
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,740
if you live in America, you better get real,

1070
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,660
you better get real used to the idea of being dissatisfied

1071
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,100
with your material possessions.

1072
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,220
And right now you're thinking good enough,

1073
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,060
and we don't know that term here.

1074
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,580
We always want bigger and better.

1075
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,860
Your towel's fine, but can you wrap your whole body in it

1076
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,900
three times and then your head and also feet?

1077
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,980
Is it still as fluffy as it was when you bought it

1078
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,860
three months ago?

1079
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,500
Is your love?

1080
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,740
You're saying that there's always better shit.

1081
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,900
There's always newer shit.

1082
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,580
Watch like Cribs and pick one thing on there.

1083
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,420
It's better than the thing you have at your house.

1084
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,020
Unless you're watching a real bummer episode

1085
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,780
like Sean William Scott or something.

1086
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,820
Wait, was his a bummer?

1087
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,100
Oh God, he just lived in an apartment with two other dudes.

1088
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,140
Did you ever see Red Man?

1089
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,220
Red Man had piss in his toilet and his doorbell was broken.

1090
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,860
Sean William Scott lived in an apartment with like

1091
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,020
two other guys and they had two rooms

1092
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,460
and they were like sharing a bed

1093
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,860
and there were boxes of pizza all over the floor.

1094
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,940
I did not know how they got on television,

1095
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,580
but it was amazing.

1096
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,980
That's amazing. It's like Sean William Scott

1097
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,180
was totally recognized the fact that his star

1098
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,260
was going to burn so bright and so fast.

1099
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,460
Like I cannot afford to go by.

1100
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,180
Like don't be silly right now.

1101
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,460
Thank you, Sean William Scott.

1102
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,660
Thanks for the, thanks for.

1103
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,140
You were, you were so good at Meet the Needles.

1104
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,060
I don't think that was, I don't think that was his.

1105
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,900
Pretty sure he wasn't in Meet the Needles.

1106
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,780
Pretty sure.

1107
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,060
Do you have a Yahoo that would be good?

1108
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,860
What's the one about pubes you talked about?

1109
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,180
Yeah, let's chart that old pubes number out.

1110
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,860
You mentioned something about pubes,

1111
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,660
if I'm not mistaken.

1112
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,340
This, something in a pubes.

1113
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,460
This was sent in by Layla.

1114
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,100
Thanks, Layla.

1115
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,580
It's, I mean, you, I feel like I've already spoiled the,

1116
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,620
I feel like I've already ruined the prestige.

1117
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,500
Okay.

1118
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,100
This is asked by Yahoo answers user Keith who asks,

1119
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,860
how do I prevent my dog from eating pubic hair

1120
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,900
he finds in the bathroom?

1121
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:35,780
Okay.

1122
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,660
There's not.

1123
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,180
Why do you need more details than that?

1124
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,380
You could try, put some quick lime on them.

1125
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,740
That's going to scare them right away.

1126
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,300
If you dump a little quick lime right on your pubes,

1127
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,940
that's going to keep your dog away.

1128
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,460
It's going to keep deers away.

1129
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,860
If that's a problem for you.

1130
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,460
You could also go with a no-no can.

1131
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,020
Just get like a Pepsi can full of small pebbles

1132
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,940
and every time he goes to eat the pubic hair,

1133
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,820
you shake the no-no can at him.

1134
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,420
Yeah, but that means you will have to be there

1135
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,700
pretty much constantly.

1136
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,580
So you'll have to.

1137
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,540
You're going to have to set,

1138
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,980
you're going to have to set a honey pot.

1139
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,460
And so you're going to have to place pubes there

1140
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,060
specifically to draw the dog in.

1141
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,580
Or you could hire an attendant to stand over your pubes

1142
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,860
that you left in the bathroom.

1143
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,660
Tie a can of, tie a long thread of cans

1144
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,100
to one of the pubes.

1145
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,900
And then when he eats it, then he'll run around

1146
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,580
and you'll hear the cans banging around.

1147
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,540
That seems like less of a way to get him to stop,

1148
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,900
more of a way to know that he's done.

1149
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,580
Put the pubes on glue.

1150
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,820
Okay.

1151
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,140
Okay, and then he'll try to lick it,

1152
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,340
but his tongue gets stuck.

1153
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,700
And then the more he looks at it.

1154
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,020
Hire a bigger dog to protect your pubes.

1155
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,220
It would be so much, it would be so much easier

1156
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,140
to get your dog to stop doing things

1157
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,260
if dogs felt ashamed or embarrassment or anything.

1158
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,900
Have you considered building a small house

1159
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,500
around your pubes and locking the door?

1160
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,300
Or, or get rid of the dog.

1161
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,380
Wow, Trout.

1162
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:03,940
Wow, Trout.

1163
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,620
I'm just saying, I mean, I know it's drastic,

1164
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,420
but it would work.

1165
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,740
Cut off his pubes, put them over,

1166
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,860
camouflage your own pubes with them.

1167
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,220
And then when he sees them, he's like,

1168
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,100
oh, no big deal.

1169
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:14,660
It's just mine.

1170
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,540
Cut off his pubes and eat them in front of him.

1171
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,500
Be like, how's this feel?

1172
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,420
How do you like this?

1173
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,100
Sounds so nice when it happens to you, is it?

1174
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,140
Makes you feel pretty sad to watch me eating your pubes.

1175
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,420
I mean, wait a minute.

1176
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,620
I love this and I have a boner.

1177
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,120
Oh God.

1178
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,060
Oh boy.

1179
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,940
Oh boy.

1180
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,060
Sam back at quantum leap out.

1181
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,260
Ziggy, I messed up.

1182
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,980
Ziggy, I ate the pubes.

1183
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,740
No, and then Dean Stockwell apparates.

1184
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,860
Ow, I ate the pubes.

1185
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,580
Why haven't I leave?

1186
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,540
Dean Stockwell appears.

1187
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,900
He's like, nope, that's pretty much,

1188
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,500
that's what you needed to do here, actually.

1189
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,540
I'm consulting with Ziggy.

1190
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,100
This can't be right.

1191
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,580
But it said in order to prevent catastrophe,

1192
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,580
you had to learn that you like eating pubes.

1193
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,980
So if you hadn't eaten those pubes,

1194
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,820
Jackie Kennedy would have been shot too.

1195
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,300
Yeah.

1196
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,020
Think about it.

1197
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:57,700
Think about it.

1198
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,060
That doesn't sound right, Al.

1199
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,500
Eat more dog pubes, Sam.

1200
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,740
Sam, save some pubes for me.

1201
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,300
Sam, now I have to go punch Colin McLaughlin in the stomach

1202
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,140
because Dennis Hopper told me to.

1203
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,300
Blue Velvet again.

1204
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,340
Man, great film.

1205
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,580
That one scene where Isabella Rossellini gets fucked

1206
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,820
by dog pubes is amazing.

1207
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,940
It's animated and claymated, which is weird to do both.

1208
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,340
What a fun episode.

1209
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,260
Do you think?

1210
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,540
Tomorrow I'm going to listen to it and wonder

1211
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,420
who is that hilarious stranger recording with my brothers

1212
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,500
and why did I miss the recording?

1213
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,140
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1214
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,260
It's a psychosexual journey into the unknown,

1215
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,260
starring three actual brothers, Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy.

1216
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,540
Every week we listen to you, your questions,

1217
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:53,140
and we help you rebuild your life from what you've done to it every week.

1218
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,060
That we made you do to it the previous week.

1219
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,420
We're sorry.

1220
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:00,020
Every week is about undoing the damage we've done.

1221
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,340
Twitter, thank you so much for tweeting about our program

1222
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,900
using the NBNBA hashtag.

1223
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,540
Joel Kelly, C. Duncan Cook, John Gregory,

1224
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:15,460
Santa Proden, Amalaya Shuri, Mark Brown,

1225
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,060
Jan Villarosa, Evan Weston, Bramblepelt,

1226
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,500
Loretta Zahn, Isaac Zuka, Zix, Sarah, Erin S.

1227
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,660
So many people tweeting about our program.

1228
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,660
Thank you so, so much for doing so.

1229
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,020
If you want to share our site with other people,

1230
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,060
our podcast rather, if you want to share our clothing site.

1231
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,300
We got an Etsy site if you want to check it out.

1232
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,780
It's just some, like we find local stained glass

1233
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,460
that's been broken or discarded.

1234
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,380
Anyway, so we have a sampler.

1235
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,380
It's bit.ly forward slash it's bambambam.

1236
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,860
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1237
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,980
for the use of our theme song, which is called It's a Departure.

1238
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,780
You can find it on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1239
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,780
Whenever I see people like on Twitter talking about

1240
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,180
how they just bought this album and how we were right.

1241
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,900
And thank you.

1242
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,940
And thank you, John Roderick.

1243
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,460
And thank you, Long Winters for making it.

1244
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,500
I get fucking angry because it's like, why are you?

1245
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,540
It's like we've been hanging out at a party

1246
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,980
that lasted two and a half years.

1247
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,700
And now you're only just bothering to ask what my name is.

1248
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,660
You know what I mean?

1249
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,740
What I find even funnier is when people ask like,

1250
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,340
what is that intro music?

1251
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,780
And it's like, we talk about it at the end of every episode.

1252
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,220
That's been the show, I guess.

1253
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:35,140
Oh, hey, we're going to be at Max Fun Con, Max Fun Con West

1254
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,020
this May and June, end of May or beginning of June.

1255
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,380
And I believe last check, there was still a couple beds available.

1256
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,940
So head on over to maxfuncon.com.

1257
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,380
It's going to be wild.

1258
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,020
We're going to be there.

1259
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,740
But more importantly, like cool people will too.

1260
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,940
So get also.

1261
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,020
If you would like to have a personal message

1262
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,700
or a business message on the show,

1263
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,380
go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron

1264
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,660
and they will get you all set up.

1265
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,700
Also, the brothers and I have decided that

1266
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,540
we are ready to do more live shows.

1267
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,500
We're hoping to do one in April,

1268
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,100
but we're just not sure where yet.

1269
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:15,140
So if you have any suggestions or if you like know any venues

1270
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,220
that will be awesome for us to perform at,

1271
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,940
then let us know and we'll try to get something set up.

1272
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,300
I think we'd really like to do like New England.

1273
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,900
Yeah, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, somewhere around there.

1274
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,380
So if you can make that happen for us,

1275
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,500
if you know of a venue or not just know of a venue,

1276
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,860
but like you know a guy who can get us in.

1277
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,660
He's into the show and you know.

1278
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,620
We need you to grease some palms.

1279
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,700
We need you to be able to grease some wheels for us

1280
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,660
to make this a little easier.

1281
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,420
Grease some wheels and you're going to be greasing.

1282
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,100
Sorry, step one.

1283
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,100
You're going to need to procure a lot of grease.

1284
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,020
That's that's huge.

1285
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,580
It's vital.

1286
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,380
This final Yahoo answer is sent in by Ira Ray.

1287
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,100
Thank you, Ira Ray.

1288
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,620
All right, so Yahoo answers user Mr. Mr. Funeral asks,

1289
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,980
who thinks Bea Arthur should have been buried in a cemetery

1290
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,180
instead of cremated?

1291
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,180
I'm Justin McElroy.

1292
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1293
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1294
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,060
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1295
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:47,620
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
