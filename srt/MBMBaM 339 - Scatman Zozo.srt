1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Just say, hey, I want it.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Just say, hey, I want it.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 on 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
January 27th has been marked on my calendar since last January 27th.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, I've got goose pimples.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm so excited about A Dog's Purpose.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Just bristling with goose flesh over here, so excited for A Dog's Purpose that comes out on January 27th in theaters near you.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm really excited about it.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think it's going to be a huge picture.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There have been multiple reports of abuses to dogs during filming.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And I think the film is going to be a real heartwarming picture for families to enjoy together.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm just glad that the movie goes out of its way to prove that A Dog's Purpose is to entertain us.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, and then die, but then be a different dog later.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What the cost.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My favorite part of the trailer is when the beagle dies and then is a golden retriever, which then dies in an airplane crash, and then all of a sudden it's a beagle again.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I love you, A Dog's Purpose.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's A Dog's Purpose.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When they were making it, they were like, what's everybody's favorite part of Marley and Me?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The end of it.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So what if they just made a movie that was all the end of Marley and Me, just over and over again forever?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The dogs die over and over again.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But then you get a new dog.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You would think at some point this dog would be like, okay, so reincarnation is real, but I am just a dog.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like, what do I have to do here to get out of this cycle?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm just a dog over and over again.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Different breeds, of course.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I mean, I don't want to be a whippet.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to be a chocolate lab, so let's go talk to that bus.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Poof.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, I haven't seen it, but do you think the movie ends in the final incarnation, the dog wakes up, and they are finally a human?

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, I think the final incarnation is he wakes up and he's half dog, half man.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's like, well, it's a start.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe they go full action hero.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then some badass Guy Ritchie end credits.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There we go.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We could also have a bicentennial man situation where he does become a human and he does marry his master, the woman who owned him the whole time.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And then they fall in love.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Listen, I really want to marry you, but I am a dog now, but I have a very good feeling about this one.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you could throw me into that wood chipper and just let me try one more again, I think that I will come back as a human on this one.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So what you're pitching like a Marley and Me Groundhog's Day crossover.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Right, exactly.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He does some good shit for like an afternoon.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's like, well, time to beef it.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's see if I can be a human this time.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A lot of people forget it was a book first.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A Dog's Purpose was a 2010 novel written by American humorist W.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Bruce Cameron, who I'm sure you all remember from 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, which was a series that was also adapted into.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please tell us, please tell us more about 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, Justin.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter was adapted into a TV series that, of course, killed John Ritter is the most notable.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, Justin.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It did.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I mean, it did.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What do you want from me?

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's the show that killed John Ritter.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So Bruce has had a good run, and now he's back with just killing dogs over and over again.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Not dogs, the same dog.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The same dog.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And Dennis quades in the movie, and at the end of it, he dies, and he becomes five birds.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think I had the same reaction a lot of people did the first time they saw the trailer, that my wife showed it to me, just like losing it.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like couldn't do anything, just hold the phone aloft for me to view.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought for sure it was a Christian movie.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like it had to be a Christian movie.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is a Christian movie.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That endorses dog reincarnation.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, we're like Jesus.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He helps Jesus or tell somebody about Jesus or helps them find Jesus or something.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why is there only one set of paw prints?

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Exactly.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's where I did fun dog tricks for your entertainment.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But then I saw Dennis Quade, and I was like, Denny, are you doing okay?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Denny, are you in the film?

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
For the first, until Denny's reveal in the movie, in the trailer, you could have very easily convinced me that we were looking like an Animal Planet original movie.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sure.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That they were getting into the movie business.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But then he was like, he calls his agent.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He's like, listen, it's Denny.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just finished up that script.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For a dog's purpose, you sent over that hot one.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Denny Q got the script.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Denny Q got the script, did absorb.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Listen, five stars.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This script only needs one thing, and I think this film will flop unless you make one big change.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And they're like, what?

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And he's like, you're going to need some vitamin D.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And that's for goodness.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're also going to need to kill three times more dogs.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There's only eight dogs that die in it.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I haven't seen the movie yet.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But as I understand it, it's about a dog that keeps dying and coming back as other dogs that keeps finding Dennis Quaid.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And trying to kill him.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I hope there's a scene in the movie where Dennis Quaid lives in Connecticut or whatever, and then the dog falls in the lake.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then it comes back, and it's a chocolate lab.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But, oh, damn it, I'm in Wales.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, fuck.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've got to get all the way back.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Damn it.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And he finally gets back to Connecticut after like a year of getting there.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And he's like, hey, what's up?

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And then a tree falls on him, and he's like born in Madagascar.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And he's like, why the fuck is this so much travel?

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know once he gets stateside, he's being like super cautious.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like every street.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, no, no, I'll wait for the light.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know I'm a dog.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I'm going to go ahead and wait for the light.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Griffin, I actually saw a press screener of the movie.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And the fucked up thing is the dog actually keeps being reborn in like the same town that Dennis Quaid was originally in.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And Dennis Quaid keeps moving.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Dennis Quaid keeps trying to get away from this fucking dog, and the dog keeps finding him every time.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And that's the dog's purpose.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to teach English in Shanghai.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ah, damn it.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How am I supposed to?

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm a dog, DQ.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, DQ.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DQ.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Help me.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
DQ, why do you do this?

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why do you do this to me, DQ?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The thing they don't tell you is that Dennis Quaid kills the dog every time.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And the dog is just trying to like – he knows he's got a serial killer on his hands.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And he's trying to reveal the crime.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And every time he gets close, Denny Q is like, nah, nah, nah, not this time.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, just like well, just put it in a well.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He starts it out so it won't reincarnate as fast, it gives him time to get away.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
God.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a dark movie, Griffin.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know what to tell you.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the lovely – it's the lovely bones, which would also work as a title for a dog-based movie.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The milky bones.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The tasty bones, the begging strips.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Boy, a dog's purpose out January 27th.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm so excited to see it and see if all the fan theories are true.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've been playing along with the ARG online, and we're all having a lot of fun here at the –

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we call ourselves the purpose heads, and we're just so fucking excited for this movie.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A Dog's Purpose is – it's buck wild.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Very important to me.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's very important.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I did want to release – and again, some pretty brutal animal abuse allegations that are in no way funny,

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
but it is A Dog's Purpose is the name of the film.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So if you want to avoid it or watch it – I feel like a watch doesn't always have to be positive.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sometimes it's sort of like, I got my eye on you.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know what I mean?

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I got a crime watch.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How do you think Deque is feeling right now after these dog abuse allegations have started popping off?

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because holy shit.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I read some of the responses from people involved, like Josh Gad is the voice of the dog.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Josh Gad's fully like, don't know, wasn't there.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The director of the movie is like, don't know, wasn't on set that day.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wouldn't have happened if I had been there.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hachi machi.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sure Deque felt the same way.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's like, no, I was getting some crafty and just enjoying myself and trying to center myself for the performance.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They had tortillas, soup over it, crafty, and so I was mostly hanging around that sort of station.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was talking to my brother.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you need to check that alibi, you can call him.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, what's that?

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can't get a hold of him?

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Weird.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Weird.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's so weird.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just a quick side watch.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Trolls, the film is coming to – it'll be on on-demand stuff I think this week, January 24th tomorrow.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Apple TV, I know it's going to be there.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Blu-ray I think is the following week.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm very, very excited because it'll finally be the end of my daughter wanting to watch the Trolls movie and it not being available.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Watching the most batshit content on YouTube is fucking so crazy right now.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know if you guys have gotten – if you search for Trolls toys, which is normally what we end up going with, there's short films about –

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I know I've talked about weird YouTube before, but kids weird – there was one where the Trolls toys had all their heads pulled off

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and then their heads were hidden underneath other toys that had to be opened by this giant pair of hands on screen

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and then the heads had to be reconnected and then there was another one where Branch and Poppy got married and then Poppy got pregnant

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and it was just like a short film about that for kids.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's pretty wild out there on YouTube, y'all.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you haven't been out there, but that – my hell will come to an end where I can finally just enjoy the film.

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I saw it two times in the theaters, but now I'm like finally going to be able to just enjoy the story of Branch

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and him finding joy in his heart again on Apple TV when I purchase that film tomorrow, January 24th.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then you're just three days away from A Dog's Purpose coming out.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So how's your cinematic week?

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's going to be a very good cinematic week.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Guys, Star Wars just now, while we're recording this, just announced the name of the new movie.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's Star Wars Episode VIII, The Last Jedi, which I very much doubt that.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There will probably be a few more of those – those magic space warriors.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it really called that? Is that a joke?

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The Last Jedi. I'm the last Jedi. Really? Because there's two of you.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, it's – the movie ended and there were two of you. No, but I'm the last one.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't believe that one.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't believe it.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't believe it.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Number nine's going to be like, just kidding, here's six more Jedis.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Man, it's so rare we get to do breaking news on the program.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, it's so nice to be able to bust out some entertainment news.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Travis, you've gone silent for a while.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're just sort of contemplating, what, Trolls, Dog's Purpose, Star Wars VIII?

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's so many different things you could be thinking about right now.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, I'll tell you the truth.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
While Justin was describing his weird YouTube wormhole, my brain broke a little bit,

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and I thought, like, I must have dropped out of the call or something,

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
because I just – I couldn't understand the words he was saying.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, it's – if you Google Trolls toys and then hold on for the ride of your life,

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and it's all toy videos on YouTube, are absolutely madness.

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's a video called Branch and Poppy Kiss.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, a lot of people are waiting for that.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
With real people as the trolls, it's nine minutes – it's nine minutes long.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, it's just a really long smooch then.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What could be happening for nine minutes in this film?

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How much story development is happening in here?

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know what?

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Here.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just for a second.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just for a second.

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, this isn't going to be good for anybody, Juice.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I just dropped it in the Skype chat.

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Just for a second.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you guys could just, like – this is my –

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, wow.

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is actually a lot.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wow.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is a lot to – it's a lot to deal with if you Google Trolls Poppy and Branch Kiss on YouTube.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So right now I'm looking at a man, and he's doing Green Face,

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and he's got some blue Goku hair, and it's just a lot of –

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
well, a lot of build up to the kiss.

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm kind of hopping around, kind of scrabbling through this video.

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This shit has four million over –

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's the worst thing we're done.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're done with.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's over, Johnny.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We've got to stop.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We've got to do questions.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We've got to do advice.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We've got to do questions and advice.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What is that?

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Nobody can see this.

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's probably a Bergen.

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The Bergens eat the trolls to be happy.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So listen, it's pretty crazy out there on YouTube right now.

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
People are putting lots of videos up on YouTube right now.

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was on it the other day, and I watched the first season of Bug Juice is all on there.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah.

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So get at me.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And you can also watch Branch and Poppy French Kiss for 38 minutes.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's been 15 minutes.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We've got to do the damn thing.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Brothers, I have recently learned a terrifying truth.

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I've been in this relationship for about too much.

264
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Too much indeed.

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I just found out that my girlfriend sometimes drinks milk in the shower.

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
At first I was slightly apprehensive, but I assumed it was out of a personal bottle or something.

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Then I learned that it was in fact out of an open glass with no lid.

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She insists this is perfectly acceptable, but it's an utterly horrifying concept to me.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Am I good?

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And that's from Not A Milk Drinker in Massachusetts.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Mmm.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How busy are you, huh?

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I have so many things on my to-do list, I have to combine some of them.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, I have to drink some milk and take a shower.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Of all the activities to combine, that is by far the least convenient.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So this would the – okay.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The personal bottle is like weird to me.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I guess you mean a personal bottle of milk, not like a baba.

284
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That makes sense.

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sorry, guys.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Or just like your aluminum special bottle that you refill with milk for the shower times.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The thought of drinking milk and then a little bit of water getting in there is no good.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't like that even a little bit.

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't like the thought of drinking milk because I'm pretty lactose intolerant,

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and then I would be drinking milk on the toilet, and then that's a never-ending cycle.

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I would be in the bathroom all day just dealing with all these milk problems that I've given myself.

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But the thought of drinking a big glass of milk and then you turn around weird,

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and then like a little bit of hot water gets in the milk, bad.

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Now that is how they make skim milk.

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They just add hot water to milk?

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
They add hot shower water.

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hot shower water and a little bit of head and shoulders, a little bit of Irish spring in there.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't think you should do that.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't think that that should be done in society that we're in now because I just don't understand.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But you know-

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But you know, Zag, I would like to zag for a second.

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, shit.

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay, zag on him.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If this is what your girlfriend does to just like chill, if this is like her me time is a little shower milk, it ain't hurting nobody.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This isn't taking anything away from you.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This might like her, you know, frosty glass of shower milk might be the only time she gets in her day to really just like treat herself to some shower milk.

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You know what I do?

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You know what I do?

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What's that?

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I would drink some of that shower milk, some of that frosty shower milk just to get the buzz going.

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then when I was sick of drinking the milk or when my stomach started hurting immediately,

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
as soon as it crossed the threshold of my diaphragms and stuff, all my flanges and stuff,

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
as soon as it crosses that and it hits my stomach lining and my guts go all rotten,

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
as soon as I was done drinking it, I would just dump it on myself and get that baby soft milk skin.

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And maybe that's, you know, you drink it and you drink it down to halfway and you're like, I'm sick.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And then you dump it on your body and you get that baby soft milk skin.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

322
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is she just looking to extend the shower maybe?

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Just like she really loves shower time, but she – okay, okay, wait.

324
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This has just occurred to me.

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You need your hands in there.

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Listen.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You need your hands in there.

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't have one hand constantly on milk duty.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
How do you squeeze the Irish spring into the loofah if you have one hand holding your milk?

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean, maybe you got a cup holder in there.

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe it's a custom job.

332
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, nice.

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You know what?

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That is a good gift though.

335
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Good gift idea, a shower cup holder, if you can find one of those on Amazon or something.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's a good gift because it doesn't just say, here's a cup for your shower milk.

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It also says like, I accept you.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know what I mean?

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like, I accept you.

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have a Yahoo here.

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Can I read it?

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And whoa, Yahoo, giving me a banner advertisement for Shondaland.

345
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hello.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a real thing.

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Guys, Yahoo's advertising a thing that I could go and watch and consume.

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not telling me about Melissa McCarthy or Ellen DeGeneres' recent death.

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Things are turning around.

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Very exciting.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

354
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you.

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now it's rooms to go.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
God, Altaba's really taken off.

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe I should give Altaba a chance.

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Jefferson asks, help, how to properly get rid of a Ouija board.

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Ouija?

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A lot of people say Ouija, and that doesn't, it's not.

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It can't be, right?

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's Elijah.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Elijah.

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I have had nothing but bad luck with this paper, paper board I printed.

366
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And I'm tired of it.

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I just want to move on and not think about the paranormal anymore.

368
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's been telling me to kill by someone named Zozo I've been lied to by something named Kelly or Nancy.

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's a bad board you got, dude.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Kill by someone named Zozo or I've been lied to by someone named Kelly or Nancy.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
How to properly get rid of this thing.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want it out of my life.

373
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, and please, don't tell me that Ouija boards are fake because I had it turn off the light in my house.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So don't say it's fake because it's real.

375
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Whoa, what?

376
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey, hey, hey, if you think it's fake because you haven't tried it using it hard enough or you're just too wussy to try it.

377
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So tell me how to get rid of this thing.

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So important.

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is your Ouija board hooked up to your Echo diet?

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Your Elijah board has smart home technology inside of it.

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's the internet of Ouija.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Finally a smart board.

384
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because it's 2017.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Your Ouija board should be smart.

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Listen, can we drill down on one question?

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I've been lied to by what?

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Kelly or Nancy.

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Kelly or Nancy.

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Exactly.

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's telling me to kill by someone named Zozo, so.

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Zozo's, okay, I get that.

394
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

395
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
When you use, think about the practicalities of using a Ouija board, okay?

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Why do you think there are, like, I don't understand how you're differentiating between two entities named Kelly or Nancy.

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like, why would you think that's the same person that's just maybe going by Kelly or maybe going by Nancy?

398
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It says, Justin, I'll tell you the problem here, Justin.

399
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The question asker assumes that they have a faulty board when I think they have a faulty ghost.

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And you're like, hey, ghost, who killed you?

401
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the ghost is like, I don't know.

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Kelly?

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Nancy?

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Who can you even tell?

405
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Nancy?

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Maybe all the spirit said is it's a woman's name and it ends in a Y.

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So just like.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's K-E-L-L-Y, wait, N-A-H, hold up.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay.

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Maybe their name is like Mary Sue, but it's Kelly Nancy.

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, damn it.

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
My name is Kelly Nancy and I want you to kill people.

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Now, Yahoo Answers user Dr. NG says, since it's a paper Ouija, it's not a genuine Hasbro Ouija.

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It is worthless.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It wasn't made by the Hasbro witches.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The Hasbro necromancers.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Had you not been a cheapo and bought yourself a proper G-H-O at any fine toy store?

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No fucking clue what that means.

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You could have donated.

421
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Genuine Hasbro Ouija.

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Probably.

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

424
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You could have donated it to Goodwill.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
As a game, it's good for a $2 tax deduction if you itemize your tax.

426
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now, listen, Kevin, taxes all look good.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I do want to ask you about this one charitable donation of a, it says here a Ouija board, $2 donation of a Ouija board.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is that correct?

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It was a G-H-O, Tom.

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know what to tell you.

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It was a G-H-O.

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It was a genuine article, babe.

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, Jesus.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's definitely this person's concern.

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How do I get rid of my printed paper Ouija board while also saving myself some scratch?

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Excuse me, gentlemen.

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I, by Googling G-H-O Ouija board, have stumbled on an article called warning signs of Zozo, the Ouija board demon.

438
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, that's no good.

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, well, this is probably a fucking, this is probably the movie, isn't it?

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is probably the movie.

441
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think there's probably the movie How to Zozo, I bet.

442
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Here are some signs you may be in contact with Zozo.

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ah, geez.

444
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Below, now our podcast is haunted, by the way.

445
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Great.

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Below is a list of items that may indicate you are in contact with Zozo during a spirit communication session.

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't want to be in contact with Zozo.

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Damn it.

449
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Hang up, Zozo.

450
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Hang up, Zozo.

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Get out of here.

452
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey, put Smoove back on.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Put Smoove on the line.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Put Smoove back on.

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I miss Smoove.

456
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Get out of here, Zozo.

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Rapid figure eight movements of the planchette.

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Rainbow side to side movements of the planchette.

459
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If the planchette spells out Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz.

460
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Papa, beep beep, ding ding.

461
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Or Ajo, Ding Dong, Bobo.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, damn it, guys.

463
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It said ding ding.

464
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Zozo's here.

465
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Why didn't you just come ding ding?

466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's mean.

467
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay, wait a minute.

468
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What if you're, so it spells out all these things.

469
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What if you're not in touch with a demon, but rather are in touch with the ghost of Scatman, uh, the Scatman?

470
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz, Abacus, Zozo, Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Mama, Oz, Zozo, Abacus, I'm the Scatman.

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Crevans.

472
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Zozo, Zaza, Mama, Oz, Abacus, Zozo, Zaza, Mama.

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Figure eight movements, rainbow shape.

474
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Shake your planchette all over the place.

475
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We gotta destroy the Ouija, though, because we can't have a Jumanji situation.

476
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Although, now that I'm thinking about it, that's not what that is.

477
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm thinking of the mask, where they tried to destroy the mask, but it kept coming back.

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If they printed off their own Ouija, where did they get the planchette from?

479
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I don't know, Travis, that's a fine question.

480
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Probably made it from a jelly jar and saran wrap, if I had to guess.

481
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm just saying, like, we should diagnose, though, like, if your computer's broken, if your computer is inhabited by Zozo, you don't just assume it's something.

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You run through some diagnosis.

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm just saying, maybe the problem is not the board, but in fact the planchette.

484
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The Cate Blanchette, you know what I mean?

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Like, maybe that's the problem.

486
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's entirely possible, but we're all dancing around the bullshit of how to destroy a genuine Ouija.

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's not, though.

488
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's not a genuine Griffin.

489
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You're right.

490
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's not a genuine Ouija, so this person's just making shit up, and they don't have Zozo, you're fine, put it in the garbage disposal, flush your stupid paper Ouija down the toilet.

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now, if I had a genuine GHO, and this thing was ruined with Zozo, nasty with Zozo, dripping with Zozo's ichor, what do I do about him?

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You gotta bury it under your local shoe factory.

493
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
One thing that this website recommends is that you set boundaries before you start any spirit communication.

494
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What?

495
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, it's important to set boundaries with ghosts and these demons that you may be communicating with.

496
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Hey, so that wouldn't be a very good demon, huh?

497
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If you have a safe word that it respects.

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's not really what I think of with a demon.

499
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, oh, okay, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry, you're right.

501
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I crossed the line.

502
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That was too far.

503
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That was on me.

504
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I get it.

505
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You know what I mean?

506
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Thank you for communicating with me instead of just being mad and not telling me why.

507
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Instead of at me, I statement, I am a demon, I want to eat your soul.

508
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do you think after the Ouija movie came out that the rate of Ouija usage across the country spiked or diminished?

509
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Do you think that kids saw the Ouija movie and said, I don't want to fuck with Zozo, and so they did not buy a Ouija board?

510
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Because you know Hasbro probably pushed, very much so like they did with Trolls when Trolls came out.

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They were like, here's new Trolls.

512
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I bet they started printing Ouija boards again to time it with the release of the movie.

513
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But that puts themselves in a weird situation where it's like, it's a Ouija board.

514
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And then you're like, oh, sick.

515
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And you see the movie and the kids get killed by Zozo probably.

516
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And then you think like, this is not a good advertisement.

517
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's not if like in the Coca-Cola polar bear commercials, if a child came up to try to get some Coca-Cola and the polar bear fucking killed them.

518
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That would make you think like, maybe I don't want Coca-Cola.

519
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So do you think people are using these things more or less?

520
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, I know to speak for myself, Griffin, just using I statements here.

521
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I have not stopped playing battleships since I saw that fucking flick.

522
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So I would think that probably it's the same deal where like you just get the fever, you know?

523
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Do you think if you saw when the year after Jumanji came out and swept the nation with David Alan Grier fever, with dag fever.

524
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Do you think that if you were a small child the year after that movie came out and you loved that movie so much.

525
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And you found an old mysterious board game that you would fucking play it.

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because I think I still would be like, I know this is going to like really be taxing on David Alan Grier.

527
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I kind of want to know what the adventure is.

528
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's an old wooden box in your grandma's cupboard.

529
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And it says like, tropical adventure on it.

530
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And you're like, I think I'd like to find out.

531
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And there is like a faint drumming noise coming from the box.

532
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And you just saw Jumanji.

533
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Would you still crack that lid and roll those bones?

534
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hell yes.

535
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
No question.

536
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I played Jumanji in a heartbeat if given the opportunity.

537
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Do you think the Zathura kids saw Jumanji and when they saw the Zathura box they were like,

538
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
this is going to take us on a deadly space adventure but fuck it man.

539
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It didn't work out so great for David Alan Grier but I really want to check out the Zathura game.

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Are you aware that Ouija the movie was produced by Hasbro Studios?

541
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

542
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Is there?

543
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It kills people.

544
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah.

545
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Like this isn't a film.

546
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Come buy our game.

547
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Come buy our game.

548
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It'll kill your kids with Zozo.

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Merry Christmas.

550
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I got you a Ouija.

551
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I want you dead you dirty fucking rat.

552
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Perfect.

553
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Print it.

554
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Send it to theaters.

555
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You nasty fucking nephew.

556
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I got you a Ouija board.

557
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I hope Zozo chokes the life out of you you nasty nephew.

558
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It does strike me.

559
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I keep thinking about the Ouija board and it's weird because it's very singular to me.

560
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I can't think of another board game that is sold that's like enjoy playing Monopoly

561
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but also when you play it you're making real money.

562
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like there's not really another board game that has a deeper layer of like sales pitch to it.

563
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Like the Ouija is a fun party game and also you're contacting Satan.

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like that's such a weird and people are like that's fun.

565
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Like you can buy it at Target.

566
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah like when you pop the Pop-O-Matic popper in Sorry they don't try to convince you the dice are alive.

567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's really shaking those pieces of shit up.

569
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Be careful playing the game of life.

570
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like you've got real babies now.

571
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The game of death.

572
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I hope your mousetrap works.

573
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Those little rats have the plague.

574
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
They don't really.

575
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's just such a fucked up sales pitch.

576
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Buy our game.

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It might kill you.

578
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean you could play Grape Escape with real grapes I guess.

579
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I was going to juggle with that but you could do that.

580
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You don't have to make them take them to the factory and smash them in another history.

581
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You could just like get some grapes and play Grape Escape with real girls.

582
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You might actually be worried about waking daddy.

583
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

584
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You could wake daddy so hard that your daddy in fact wakes up because the game got so overzealous.

585
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's possible.

586
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That one could happen.

587
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean you could actually put a goat on the roof when you're playing a game of Hey Pa.

588
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There's a goat on the roof.

589
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
An actual board game that Hasbro made in 1966.

590
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you think that anybody was ever playing 13 Dead End Drive and then a painting fell off their mantle and killed them?

591
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like was that...

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Statistically speaking, yes.

593
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes.

594
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Probably.

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Everything has happened once.

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, gentlemen, why don't you follow me?

597
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Get in my back seat.

598
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We're going to the money zone together.

599
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Let's go.

600
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Our first sponsor this week, Travis, I want to tell you...

601
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's a dog's purpose and we already did that one.

602
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's a dog's purpose and we did that one.

603
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Our second sponsor is Squarespace.

604
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000

It's used by a wide range of creative people.

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I saw that they actually have a new ad on Squarespace for John Malkovich making a clothing line.

616
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So, if you go to johnmalkovich.com, it's a Squarespace site where he has designed clothes and it's amazing and the whole thing is incredible.

617
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And thank you, Squarespace, by the way, because I didn't know I needed John Malkovich fashions in my life, but I do.

618
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Definitely, definitely do.

619
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000

We should do this for the podcast.

640
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We should ZipRecruit?

641
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah, we should ZipRecruit like a hype person or a social media person or like a personal chef.

642
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
What's Flavor Flav doing?

643
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He could hype us.

644
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He's probably good on money.

645
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Well, hold on.

646
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have a Jumbotron message here and it's for Bryce slash Calvin and Mackenzie.

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This message is from the podcast interest subset of the Slack subset of the acapella subset of the Glee Club,

648
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
who say, I owe brothers.

649
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Please help us congratulate Bryce, Calvin, and Mackenzie on their engagement.

650
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They are both huge fans and it would be an honor if you could bestow a choice wedding hashtag upon them.

651
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
God, I couldn't do this for my own fucking nuptials.

652
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know why I think I could do it for Bryce, Calvin, and Mackenzie.

653
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Three names, two hearts.

654
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Bryce Calmac.

655
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Bryce Calmac.

656
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Bryce Calmac, the planet the elf was from.

657
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Hashtag a very elf wedding.

658
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yep, there it is.

659
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Hashtag a very elf wedding.

660
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Hope that helps.

661
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
This message is for heads and it's from big R.

662
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And big R says, I know this way late or early by now.

663
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So let's just say it's both a happy birthday and Merry Christmas from your best friend and biggest boy.

664
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You've been the best part of my life for the last two years and now that we'll be living together by the time this is read,

665
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can't wait to share every night and morning with you.

666
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Hit me on my mobile.

667
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That's sweet.

668
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's sweet, but like it seems like we missed the time window so badly that not only might you not be living together,

669
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
you may have like died of old age in each other's arms notebook style at this point.

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And we apologize for, we're just, we got a lot of plates we're spending right now.

671
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Merry Christmas though.

672
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But here's the thing, since we just opened up that new flood of like buying things,

673
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we could have just done this so super early.

674
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's possible.

675
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like maybe big R bought this thinking like it won't do this till 2018 and here we are knocking it out in like January.

676
00:35:35,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah.

677
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Um, let's do a question.

678
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Here comes.

679
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Strap in.

680
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm leaving my job and have no interest in going out to drinks or having dinner with the people I currently work with to celebrate.

681
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's in quotes or say goodbye.

682
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
How do I make a graceful exit without having to spend social time with people who I don't like?

683
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That's from moving on in Maryland.

684
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This seems kind of like an open shut case, right?

685
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I've never accidentally hung out with people.

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I guess if I get stuck in an elevator, maybe, and somebody's got a bottle of bubbly, maybe, maybe then, but that's never happened.

687
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I don't think this is a tough one, right?

688
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Just don't.

689
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is why we need like valets and, um, you know, like a steward that can just sort of announce your non-presence at an event.

690
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I regret to inform you, Griffin McElroy has milk-based diarrhea again.

691
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Godji Godine, he says, here's a roast he made for you.

692
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Just kidding, I made it.

693
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You can have a cake, cake with your face on it, but you're not there, but the cake with your face on it is.

694
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So they could sort of ceremonially say goodbye, but like not in a way that you have to participate with.

695
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah, they can all eat your face and talk about their favorite Gregory memories.

696
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I have an idea.

697
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Okay.

698
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I've been thinking about this.

699
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Feels like a bad one.

700
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, hold on.

701
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Justin?

702
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
No, Justin's right.

703
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Sometimes there's just something in the air where I can tell you're about to float a real stick group.

704
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Just give it a moment.

705
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Maybe what you do is like maybe a week before your last day, you just kind of like spread around the office that you've decided to take like a surprise trip.

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You're going to treat yourself.

707
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You're taking a weekend getaway to like Columbia, and then you just don't come back to work.

708
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And then slowly over time, perhaps a myth will develop that either you've just decided to live in Columbia from now on, or like maybe they need to start planning like a rescue mission.

709
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

710
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Okay.

711
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm just saying maybe leave – I'm saying leave a little mystery.

712
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Just a mystery, sure.

713
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Leave just a story.

714
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Let the myth you leave behind be bigger than yourself.

715
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You know what I mean?

716
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It is important though that you alert the authorities ahead of time that this is happening.

717
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, this is going to have to go deep.

718
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
This is going to have to go all the way to the top.

719
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You know what I mean?

720
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah.

721
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I saw a trailer for A Dog's Purpose, and it taught me a lesson, and I won't see the film, but it taught me a lesson about like spending time with just people in this world, or dogs,

722
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
because you never know which one of them harbors the soul of a kindred lost spirit.

723
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You know what I mean?

724
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So like you don't know which one of your coworkers used to be another one of your coworkers that died, but you really liked that coworker.

725
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
All I'm saying is A Dog's Purpose taught me to just really value the important things in life, like human connections and also dog connections.

726
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So I just want you to think about that before you just shut all these people out.

727
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That's true.

728
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What if you miss them?

729
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What if you miss them?

730
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Maybe that last day, this is the kind of setting someone would make for like a movie where it's like your last day at work and you've hated everybody,

731
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and it wasn't until this moment that you've really come to appreciate what you never took advantage of in these people's lives and the stories that they had and the impact that they could have on your life.

732
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Maybe this last 24 hours could be your hit film Fist Fight, which I also have not seen, but I assume it's about Charlie Day and Ice Cube learning to appreciate each other as people and not fighting?

733
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I don't know.

734
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Like I said, I've only seen muted previews on Facebook and Twitter.

735
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Right.

736
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I assume that's what it's about.

737
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Or Here Comes the Boom?

738
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It could be Here Comes the Boom.

739
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
What I'm saying is that your boss could be your dog that died a while ago, so fucking show some respect.

740
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Your dog could be your boss that died a while ago.

741
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You don't know.

742
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You don't know.

743
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

744
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That's what this life has taught me, this movie, this wonderful film.

745
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I got a Yahoo here.

746
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's sent in by Mario Panagetti.

747
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Thank you, Mario.

748
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kay who asks, what would you name five sons?

749
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What would you name five sons all born two years apart?

750
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Not yous, Hubert, Jeremy, Beckett, Devin, Jack, Ryan, Clinton, Fred.

751
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sorry, what?

752
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you know.

753
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What would you name five sons?

754
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You know you're going to have five sons.

755
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Uh-huh.

756
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Like my plan, we're going to get to five any way we need to.

757
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
We will have five sons.

758
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Okay.

759
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So you have that in mind.

760
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So you come up with a naming structure for your five sons ahead of time.

761
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
What would you?

762
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Here's mine.

763
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Okay.

764
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday.

765
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It will happen Friday.

766
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Exactly.

767
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Now you're thinking about it.

768
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Okay.

769
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's a lot of work to go through and also a lot of work for these five boys to go through.

770
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
All right.

771
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Let me hit you with this.

772
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler.

773
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What happened to Ross?

774
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Where's Ross though?

775
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The dad's name is Ross.

776
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And the mom's name is Gunther.

777
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Okay.

778
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And the grandpa's name is Friends.

779
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And this is our dog, Central Perk.

780
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I didn't think about this.

781
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
When I have my one son, what if I have four more sons?

782
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah.

783
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You got to have a theme going.

784
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Can I do like Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails the Fox, Knuckles the Echidna, Big the Cat, Cream

785
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the Rabbit?

786
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
All Sonic characters.

787
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Fuck yeah.

788
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Got it.

789
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I got one.

790
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
George Foreman did a good one.

791
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yes, George Foreman had a fun time with his son names.

792
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You couldn't do that again, huh?

793
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No.

794
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Like you couldn't.

795
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's pretty wonderful that he did it, but I'm not sure you could keep doing it.

796
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
What if you named it after a single word NBC hit sitcom?

797
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So, Frasier.

798
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Mm-hmm.

799
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Cheers.

800
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Mm-hmm.

801
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
This is my son, Coach.

802
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This is my son, Wings.

803
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
This is my son, Wings.

804
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Hello, I'm Wings.

805
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm a three years old, and I am Wings.

806
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Hello, I am Wings.

807
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Hello, I am Coach.

808
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm older than Wings.

809
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I love you, big brother.

810
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I love you, Wings.

811
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
What if you named your sons like five professions?

812
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Or like you named, so for example, your son Wings, you trained from birth to become a

813
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
pilot.

814
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You know what I mean?

815
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay, and Cheers would be a cheerleader.

816
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah.

817
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Frasier would be somebody who repaired Frasiers.

818
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, it looks like I got a little bit of cracks in your Frasier.

819
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I can take care of that for you.

820
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You got to take that to... I'm a skilled Frasier, so I should be able to fix that one right

821
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
up for you.

822
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Not going to be cheap, though.

823
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Frasier like that, it's going to be in the four figure range, sorry to say.

824
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's a solid oak Frasier.

825
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Never see those anymore.

826
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Okay, the Kevin and the Furious, two Kevin, two Furious.

827
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Oh my God.

828
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The Kevin and the Furious took your drift.

829
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes.

830
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Kevin and Furious, fast Kevin.

831
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Two Kevin.

832
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
From Kelly.

833
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Two Kevin from Kevin.

834
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Fuck, that's really good, Justin.

835
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You nailed it.

836
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That's good, because then if you accidentally bone down and you crank out a couple more

837
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
calves, three more calves, the fate of the Kevin.

838
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
No, now the Kevin of the Furious.

839
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The hard thing is going to be somehow naming Kevin, Kevin Drift, but having him come after

840
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
all the others.

841
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Your third son will actually be your fifth son.

842
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I have to rearrange these names just to get the naming conventions right.

843
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Can I say how amazing it is that through all the really semi-terrible names, and they're

844
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
fun in a terrible way, or they're terrible in a fun way, either way, the Fast and Furious

845
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
films all have really bad names.

846
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The fact that they've all been building to what may be the best name for a movie ever,

847
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the fate of the Furious, which is so fucking cool of a name of a movie.

848
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The fact that they managed to pull that out towards the end is pretty outstanding.

849
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I just, I'm so excited, and I'm so hurt by what Vin has done.

850
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And I know it's not him, I know he's playing a character, but I don't think I'll ever be

851
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
able to look at him the same way again.

852
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.

853
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
How about a new question?

854
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Family comes first, right?

855
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Always, it's supposed to, so what the fuck's he doing?

856
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What's he doing right now?

857
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He's kissing Charlize, why?

858
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Why?

859
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's not who he's supposed to kiss.

860
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
She's not family.

861
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
She isn't family.

862
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
He should only be kissing family.

863
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You know it's him because there's still cars.

864
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

865
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
He's still driving faster with him.

866
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's not some sort of android.

867
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I thought that too, Justin.

868
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I watched the trailer, and I was like, this is some sort of clone or cyber android or robot

869
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
or CGI hologram like they did with Michael Jackson in that one concert.

870
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I think it's got to be a hologram, right?

871
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's really him because it's the cars.

872
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I thought maybe it was a Dave situation where it's somebody who looks like him and impersonates

873
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
him that has to take over for him.

874
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Shit.

875
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Or maybe a meet Dave situation where it's like a big guy with a bunch of little guys

876
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
inside of him, but it would be another possibility.

877
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But no, it's him because it's him, and he's saying all this right stuff, and he's driving

878
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the cars, and he's hurting his family.

879
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Wouldn't it be incredible if at the end of the new XXX movie Tyrese rolled up in just

880
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
like a super sick sports car and was like, hey, we need you back in the Fast and the

881
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Furious movies.

882
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
We've got a whole new bad guy to fight.

883
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And XXX was like, guess I better go beat Dom now.

884
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And hopped in the car.

885
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh, I see.

886
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And then the new Fast and the Furious movie starts with Tyrese and then pulling up in

887
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
that car.

888
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh, God.

889
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And that's the start of that movie.

890
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But unfortunately, they can't get it.

891
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Justin just had a very, very powerful orgasm.

892
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
A Fast and the Furious crossover with XXX where Vin Diesel is both.

893
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I can't take it.

894
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'll tell you when they're going to get there, though, it's going to be Fast and the Furious

895
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
30 because then they just put XXX right there at the end of it and there's your fucking

896
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
title.

897
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, hell yes.

898
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We've got a lot of Fast and the Furious movies.

899
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Got to make them fast for us.

900
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Got to speed up.

901
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And Furious-er.

902
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Yeah.

903
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's going to be Fast 9 feeling fine.

904
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's going to be the next one.

905
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That one's going to be a more upbeat one.

906
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Maybe Fast 10.

907
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Do it again.

908
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Maybe some web exclusive entries.

909
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Only on Netflix.

910
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The dirty Fast and Furious dozen.

911
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
We're going to get there.

912
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah.

913
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Ocean's Fast 11.

914
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah.

915
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Maybe one could just be a murder mystery for like a weekend and that's like another one

916
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
just like covered.

917
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We just got to rush through them is what I'm saying.

918
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
20 through 26 is an ARG experience.

919
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

920
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Number 27 could just be an escape room somewhere in Los Angeles.

921
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
All canonical.

922
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
All canonical.

923
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
All canonical.

924
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What happened?

925
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Ludacris dies in the escape room.

926
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Ludacris died in the escape room and he's not in the movies.

927
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah.

928
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You had to go to the escape room.

929
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's a great crossover and all the plotlines are unintelligible.

930
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yo, I can't help you guys with this one.

931
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
One of my wings is alive again.

932
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What?

933
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What?

934
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, you had to read the choose your own adventure book to understand that one.

935
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The angel that lives inside of me is starting to break through.

936
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The angel that lives inside of you?

937
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, that was in the Angry Birds Fast and Furious crossover app.

938
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I hate an angel in the Angry Birds Fast game.

939
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yo, yo, I'd love to come on this adventure, but Krombulor, the planet inside my heart,

940
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
the tiny planet inside my heart can't – it's the dark times because of the Harvest Festival,

941
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
so I can't make it out for this one.

942
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
We stole the planet from Jason Statham, remember?

943
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Remember?

944
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
When he became Galactus.

945
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's just you and me, Rocket Raccoon.

946
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Here's another question from a listener.

947
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I work at a small coffee shop.

948
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's pretty slow, so I know a lot of people that come in.

949
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I have a good rapport with the customers and often have pleasant and lengthy chats with

950
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
them.

951
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
However, I've noticed a trend where some customers have started blatantly shielding

952
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
their pin numbers from me as they pay with a card.

953
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
This offends me because it's rude, sure, but also because they think I would pick such

954
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
a boring and obsolete way to steal?

955
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
This has been happening quite a bit, and I'm wondering what my next move is.

956
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Do I say something?

957
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Am I allowed to make a goof?

958
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That's from Ocean Zero.

959
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
This is so brutal.

960
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Do you guys do that?

961
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Do you guys shield your pin?

962
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
No, I yell it out loud.

963
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Mine's just 69-69, so it's not even that good of a pin.

964
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You're going to have to catch me and kill me to take my debit card from me.

965
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's the truth.

966
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's not enough just to have my secret 69-69 phrase.

967
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I don't care.

968
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If you steal my debit card, it's going to be canceled by the time you hit the corner.

969
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's no good to you.

970
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
If somebody did perloid my numbers, which has only happened basically eight or nine

971
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:51,000
different times, and I have to just buy Russian coffee cups or something, I don't know what

972
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm doing out there, but I keep getting my numbers stolen.

973
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
When it does, the bank calls me and is like, hey, J-Man, happened again.

974
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm like, yeah, I know.

975
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It happens.

976
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Send me a new card.

977
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
They're like, you know it.

978
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And I don't care.

979
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't care.

980
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Steal my pin.

981
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I don't give a shit.

982
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I saw someone share a video with me on Facebook that's like, when you enter your pin, you

983
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
need to put, once you're done, put your whole hand on the pad, or else someone can take

984
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
a heat, one of those thermal scanners, and show which buttons are warm.

985
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
First of all, if I saw someone do that right after me, it's like, hey, what's that guy

986
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
doing with that thermal scanner?

987
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But secondly, if you brought your thermal scanner to the coffee shop to steal my pin

988
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
number, do you need money?

989
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I can give you $10.

990
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Do you need $10?

991
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Just sell the thermal scanner.

992
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah.

993
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah.

994
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Where do they get that thermal scanner?

995
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Hold on.

996
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
This is, don't do this thing.

997
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
If I'm having a nice conversation with you, and I'm making you a panini at the Starbucks,

998
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and I hand you your panini, and I say, that'll be $40, and then you try to be sneaky with

999
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
your pin, like I'm going to hack you, that hurts my feelings.

1000
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I just had a nice conversation about your kids while I made you a panini.

1001
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I think you should say, well, I think it's fair.

1002
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You didn't see what I did to that panini.

1003
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You can't watch me make your drink.

1004
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You just have to-

1005
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Are we all hacking each other all the time now?

1006
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Because it's not just computers anymore.

1007
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The prevalence of hacking has now gone around the bend for me, where it's like, they don't

1008
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
get you.

1009
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If they want you, they don't get you.

1010
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Why not just be chill about it?

1011
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I don't know.

1012
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
If you want me, they're going to get you.

1013
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm just not sweating anymore.

1014
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's going to happen.

1015
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
If they want you, they're going to get you.

1016
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Damn.

1017
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
There's got to be a way to put up a cyber wall.

1018
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No.

1019
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That's the thing.

1020
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
What you've got to do, what you've got to do is you've got to make yourself so open to

1021
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
attack that you're low hanging fruit.

1022
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No, I'm not going to hack Travis.

1023
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
There's no challenge in that.

1024
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What is that?

1025
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
A baby could hack Travis.

1026
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Look at that baby over there hacking Travis.

1027
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's the Sun Tzu baby boy technique.

1028
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Exactly.

1029
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I believe it's in the third Sun Tzu book where he says, just make yourself look like a little

1030
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
baby and do keep on yourself and then your enemies will see you and say, he's not worth

1031
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
fighting.

1032
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That's the R4-3 Tokyo Drift.

1033
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Right.

1034
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Then when they turn around, you fucking hack them.

1035
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah.

1036
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You hack them.

1037
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You hack them back.

1038
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You back them.

1039
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You counter hack.

1040
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That's what we need to do.

1041
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No walls because they're going to break through my fucking ice in the reboot cyberverse.

1042
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm just going to have to go in there myself.

1043
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I've got to learn how to.

1044
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Maybe that's my zag.

1045
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I've been trying to find out what my zag is going to be for 20 Serpentine and maybe it's

1046
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I just become a fucking white hat hacker and I sort of become, yeah.

1047
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Let me explain to you why I need that so very badly.

1048
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay.

1049
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It is my dream as a child of the 90s.

1050
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It is my dream in life to one day see a hacker on hacker computer battle with sweat on their

1051
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
brow and furious just typing and they're blocking them at every turn.

1052
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You know what I mean?

1053
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I want to see it like it's a dance.

1054
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Like it's a beautiful hacking dance.

1055
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah.

1056
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The thing I was led to believe happened all the time by movies in 1992 and I never see

1057
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it.

1058
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It doesn't happen that much.

1059
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I want it so bad and then it ends and everybody's exhausted but we barely kept the launch codes

1060
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
safe or whatever.

1061
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah.

1062
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It looks like it was a draw and I'll be like, is it?

1063
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And then I'll hold up their codes and I'll be like, got your codes.

1064
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Got your codes here.

1065
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I want it so bad.

1066
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Can I read one more Yahoo real quick?

1067
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah.

1068
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You can get one in under the wire.

1069
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's from Rachel Rosen.

1070
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Game recognized game.

1071
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Rachel Rosen.

1072
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Thank you, Rachel.

1073
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bernard A. who asks, why did John Hancock write names so big on

1074
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
the Constitution?

1075
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Now, there's a quick answer here from David B. who says John Hancock was president of

1076
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
the United States when the Declaration of Independence was adopted and signed according

1077
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
to legend.

1078
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that King George could read it without

1079
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
his spectacles but the story is apocryphal and originated years later.

1080
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Whatever the reason, it clearly had something to do with emphasis.

1081
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So, I've heard that before.

1082
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
He signed it so that King George could read it with his stupid bad eyes.

1083
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And if that's not the answer, why did my boy John Hancock, when everybody else is like,

1084
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Jill signed it John Adams.

1085
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And then this motherfucker rolls up and he's like, Jonathan Hancock.

1086
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I actually know the reason.

1087
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I know it.

1088
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Well, don't say the real reason.

1089
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
No, no, I know it, Griffin.

1090
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay, but it won't be funny if he's the real reason.

1091
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
No, I know it.

1092
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Actually, John Hancock wrote his signature so big to cover up where Ben Franklin wrote,

1093
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I signed your crack.

1094
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Oh, yeah.

1095
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Have a great summer.

1096
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Have a great summer.

1097
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I love you like a sister.

1098
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Ben Franklin.

1099
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Benny F.

1100
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And John Hancock was like, Franklin.

1101
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
He just wanted to cover up.

1102
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
He wanted to try to obscure where Ben Franklin had just written cock.

1103
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Some huge letters on there.

1104
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's like, well, we got to do something with this because Benny Franks just wrote cock.

1105
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
What did you write, John Hamm?

1106
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Don't worry about it.

1107
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Just don't worry about it.

1108
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'll just change my fucking name.

1109
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's fine.

1110
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
History will never know the difference.

1111
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
No one's going to see this shit anyways.

1112
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You're going to lock this away somewhere, right?

1113
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Until Lynn rolls up with the sequel, with the squeakquel, all about the cock man.

1114
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
There's probably not as rich a vein there.

1115
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No.

1116
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Very short.

1117
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What if he had-

1118
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Have you seen Hamilton 2, the squeakquel cock man?

1119
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Cock man?

1120
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Instead of talking about how he's going to change the world, it's exactly the same show,

1121
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
except it's just a young John Hancock talking about how one day he's going to write his name

1122
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
really big on an important document.

1123
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It could be that John Hancock had one regular hand and one Foo Fighters Everlong big hand,

1124
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and that was his right hand.

1125
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
John, please sign it with your left.

1126
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
John, wait.

1127
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Just please use the left.

1128
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No.

1129
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
We only get one shot of this.

1130
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
We've had to rewrite this thing so many times.

1131
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Please, John.

1132
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah, it's like 1700 or 1800 something, and it's the paper's really hard to come by.

1133
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Please use your not giant Everlong hand.

1134
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Paper's so hard to come by, we can't afford calendars.

1135
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
We don't even know what year it is.

1136
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It is fun to think about the fact that you live a whole life, and in one moment of extravagance,

1137
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:56,000
in one moment of extravagance, you change the whole way in which you are a person.

1138
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Through all of history, no matter what you did, father, a brother, son, patriot, politician,

1139
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
no, you're just the guy who signed his name so big on there.

1140
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But in doing so, also, there's a lot of people whose names are on there that people don't talk about much.

1141
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But old John is just like, well.

1142
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Let's have him talk about Thomas Mifflin or Robert Morris.

1143
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
They should talk about the rest of those people because the bullshit of all this is John Hancock

1144
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
wrote his name first, and everyone else went, I'm going to write it smaller than that.

1145
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Everyone else could have also, but they made John Hancock the dude in the office who signs

1146
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
the birthday card first and writes a big long message, and everybody else just writes their name.

1147
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And it's like, well, thanks everybody.

1148
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I thought we were all going to go all in on this, and you guys left me just hanging in the wind,

1149
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and you all could have written your names big too, but now I look like an asshole.

1150
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Now I look like history's asshole.

1151
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Also, I will say this.

1152
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
If you haven't looked at the signature in a while, check it out.

1153
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
If my signature was that fucking rad, it is the fate of the furious of signatures.

1154
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
If my signature was that cool, I'd probably do it really big too every time.

1155
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Also, just one last thing that we do need to address is that John Hancock defo did not sign the Constitution.

1156
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He got up on the Declaration of Independence, so we got that one wrong.

1157
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
We got that one very wrong.

1158
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
We were very wrong on that.

1159
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Let's just cut that tweet out.

1160
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Let's cut out the last 20 minutes of this podcast.

1161
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Go listen to stuff you should know if you want facts.

1162
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Stuff you should know.

1163
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are different things.

1164
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
They're different stuff.

1165
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Two different sheets.

1166
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Who signed the Constitution real big?

1167
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Did anybody do that?

1168
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, I was just looking at this.

1169
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Let's talk about this big signature, and it's from Daniel of St. Thomas Jennifer.

1170
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Who the fuck are you?

1171
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Who gave you the right, Dan?

1172
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think the weirdest part is where somebody just drew Kilroy on the Declaration.

1173
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Who did that?

1174
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You know what I mean?

1175
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Where'd that come from?

1176
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Let's wrap up so Justin can go do his jujitsu.

1177
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Excellent.

1178
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Taekwondo.

1179
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Don't be a dick.

1180
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
They're two very different things.

1181
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't know why, but I'm pretty sure they are.

1182
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm still early yet.

1183
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
That's going to do it for us this week.

1184
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
My brother, my brother and me, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1185
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Thank you to this week's sponsors.

1186
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
If you want to, I think there's a, we don't know specifically, but we're about, well,

1187
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
we are, as of this moment, exactly one month out from the premiere of my brother, my brother

1188
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and me TV show on CISO.

1189
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So you're going to start seeing things.

1190
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Start seeing some things probably this week.

1191
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So it'll be on our Facebook group, my brother, my brother and me appreciation group, and

1192
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
also on our Tweet-O at NBNB AM.

1193
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So make sure you follow those so you can see that stuff when it pops off.

1194
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1195
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1196
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's a fucking great, powerful tune off a great, powerful album, and you're just going

1197
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
to love it if you haven't listened to it already.

1198
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You can go to MaximumFun.org to check out all the shows on the Max Fun Network.

1199

1206
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It is March 4th through the 11th, and it's going to be really fun and cool.

1207

Some people that are going to be on there include Jeffrey Cranor, the Welcome to Night Vale

1208

folks, Nerf Herder.

1209
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Here's one that I just found out about, a relatively new edition that I'm really stoked

1210
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
about, Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe is going to be on there.

1211
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That's awesome.

1212
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, it is.

1213
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I'm so fucking jealous that you get to go on this.

1214
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm just going to follow her around and just tell her how much I enjoy her program, not

1215
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
in a weird way.

1216
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And we're doing a live Sawbones on there, so you're not going to want to miss that.

1217
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
In fact, you're going to want to check it totally out.

1218
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So, Jokocruise.com, there are some cabins still available, so go come with me on the

1219
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
beautiful Holland America, Westerdam ship that is a boat, probably.

1220
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
A boat ship?

1221
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah, it's going to be a pretty good cruise.

1222
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Well said.

1223
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000

It's by Jeffrey Corbello, and it's by Yahoo Answers user Shrek, who asks, in Back to the

1227
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:49,120
Future 3, since time travel is obviously fake, how did they get back to the olden west to

1228
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,120
film the movie?

1229
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,120
It's Justin McElroy.

01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,120
