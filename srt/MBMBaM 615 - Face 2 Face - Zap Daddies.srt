1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's the start of something beautiful.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My life, it feels like life.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother made advice show for the Madrin era.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And now, your starting lineup.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Does anyone know the wifi password?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll share it with you, Griffin.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I'm the sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, thanks.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
While they're doing that, this is perfect.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hi, this is an advice show.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And Boston, one of our favorite towns.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like the Chilean miners before us, we have reemerged from the ground to be with you here.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What a thrill it is to be back here.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Only now do I think about the fact that we didn't talk about what our intro was going to be.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, I think we know what the intro is going to be.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, so here's the deal.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I had a rough time getting here to your beautiful town.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Through no fault of yours, I assure you, unless you work at the airport, in which case, better luck next time.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Or if you control the weather.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you're a storm from the X-Men.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So anyway, my flight got canceled.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I ended up being rerouted instead of going to Cincinnati, Boston.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I got rerouted to Cincinnati to Norfolk, Virginia.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which actually made me further from Boston than when I started.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At my house eight hours before.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, I take the, uh, I drive, I get a car, I drive up to Washington, D.C.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Show me how you drive. Show me one more time driving.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, that's what it looks like when I do it.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Please don't drive like that.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You and Muttley out there with the other wacky racers.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I got up to Washington and then D.C. and then took the beautiful, uh, Acela train.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All the way.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Beautiful steel beast.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Anyone who's listened to Enough My Brother, specifically live shows, knows how rejuvenating a train ride can be.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I'm having an amazing seven hour train ride up to Boston.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Loving it. Love it. Don't laugh. It's amazing.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My kids aren't there.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't be clear enough about that.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm having the time of my life.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm catching up on Barry.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm ten steps from the soda and popcorn.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm living my best life.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Anyone who was here, I also have to say last night, Dad was not able to make it to the task show because of similar travel things.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And in the middle of a thread of probably 200 texts as we're trying to figure this out.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Justin texts, I'm worried.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And Paul, our stage manager slash tour manager says, Oh my God, what?

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And Justin says, I'm worried they'll make me get off the train when I get to Boston.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Um, don't take that as a slight.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No city can measure up to a train.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I'm on the train. I'm about five hours in.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I decided to treat myself to perhaps my eighth bathroom break.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm right. It's for the DVTs.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's important to stay mobile.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I go into the bathroom and I shut the door and a gentleman never tells.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As one does, I go to leave the bathroom.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The door does not open.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I try and I try to really pull.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then the claustrophobia starts really setting in really bad because I'm trapped in a bathroom on the train.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Um, and I'm pulling on the thing and then I noticed there's a button to call attendance.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I go, problem solved.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, problem solved, right?

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Can I ask how long you tried to get out of there yourself before you pressed the button specifically for getting trapped in the bathroom?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
45 seconds. I mean, actually longer than I would have thought.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The panic was kicking in at this point because I was in a closed space.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, the dilation of time.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Einstein talked about it when you're trapped in a train bathroom.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm leaning on the button and pressing the button. I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No one's coming. I don't know if the button is creating a sustained noise or it's like I push it, it's on.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Just chill.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Did you try a few different patterns?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No one comes for about five minutes and I'm still in the bathroom and I'm starting to lose it pretty bad at this point, I'll be honest.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I start pounding on the doors, help, help, help.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I'm pounding, I'm pounding, I'm pounding.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like in all my moving and jerking, I find that what has happened is the train has come off the track.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, not the train.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sorry.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Holy shit.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That was a pretty bad slip of the tongue.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My apologies.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So here's the thing, there's fire everywhere.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, no, no. So this doesn't happen. This was fine.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The door, you know, the sliding door to the bathroom has come off the track. So I think, okay, well.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The stakes of that sentence are so profoundly different.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because even if you arrive to the station trapped in a bathroom, you still got to the station.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The distance between I was trapped with my own embarrassing doo-doo smell versus a hundred souls.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So the door had come off the track through an impressive amount of Herculean effort.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I lift the door up and get it back in its track, it pops right open.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Great.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now I also have not thought about this the first time you told me this story, but also you must have closed it too hard, right?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, I closed it perfectly.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, what'd you do?

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Everyone knows that I close bathroom doors great.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You must have been so excited to do this.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, so I open the door and I very coolly.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Walk back to my seat.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now I walk past someone who looks at me when I come out and it occurs to me.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This must be very confusing for them because they're seated right next to the bathroom door.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So in their experience, a husky boy walks into the bathroom.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They hear a lot of pounding and screaming for help.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And then same husky boy walks out of the bathroom, not a care in the world.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now hold on.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, okay.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I was very concerned about what that person thought until I realized this motherfucker.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There it is.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Listen to my cries of agony and terror and did nothing.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So their experience was, help me, help me.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm like, oh man, I hope somebody helps that guy.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or alternatively, help me, help me.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What did they do to deserve this?

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can I ask what you all would do in that seat though?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because I imagine my thought process would be this would probably be a pretty uncomfortable social engagement for myself.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So I'm going to hope that someone else comes or the husky boy dies inside the bathroom.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because here would be my fear.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I would engage and then realize there was nothing I could do to help.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then have to hit that point of, well, I'm going to go back to my seat.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, no, no, no.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
One of my favorite ways to help strangers is when the job is to get an adult.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's fantastic.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can get an adult every time you look for someone in like a hat with something on it, usually.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A clipboard preferably.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A clipboard, a name tag, and then that adult takes over.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Go grab, pull on the collar of CGI Tom Hanks and get him to.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that was my harrowing journey here to Boston.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I'm so happy to be here with you now.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is an advice show.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Here's advice.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Here's advice number one.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If someone needs train based bathroom help, be the change you want to see in the world.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Listen, there are so many problems every day we can't do anything about.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But one husky boy trapped in a bathroom.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can beat Superman.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can say I'm a husky boy.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't take liberties.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I just did it for shorthand, Justin.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is an advice show.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Still, and we're going to help people.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We won't.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You all send us some questions and I'm going to read the first of those questions now and then we will turn that question alchemy like into wisdom.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Here we go.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Fruit is my favorite food.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Already.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's a bad start.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Fruit can't be your favorite.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's like building is my favorite rectangle.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you mean?

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There's literally a saying about comparing one fruit to another fruit.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, that is so different.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fruit is my favorite food.

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yesterday I brought an entire watermelon with me to a theater rehearsal along with a knife so I could slice it up to eat.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Good so far.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I brought a knife to my job.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now imagine you're at a rehearsal and you see someone doing that and think about what you would assume.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then this question continues.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
My castmates all assumed I had brought it to share.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Brothers, is there any acceptable way to explain that the whole watermelon is for me?

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
From Melon Collie in Massachusetts.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All right.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hold on. Wait.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a very good name.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Very good name. Are you here?

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, now here's.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Do you have a knife now?

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Or a melon?

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So here's the thing.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There was a point where someone said, oh, you brought a watermelon to share or some variation of that.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And what you could have said was, yeah.

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But you decided in that moment or maybe didn't and you just said there's no going back.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, no, this is a personal watermelon.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a personal pan watermelon.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There's nothing stopping you from sharing it from that point forward.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're not written all over it like just mine.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Except maybe you'd plant your whole day around enjoying this beautiful juicy boy.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And he didn't feel like sharing.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Did you wait? Did you break down and share?

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You did.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wait, hold on.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
After you said it's not for sharing and then broke down because lose lose.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, that's the worst of both worlds.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think if you have a snack that requires a knife, people are going to think you're going to share it.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If your snack requires a knife, then it's for sharing.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You might be right now.

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If your snack requires a knife.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you get real quick?

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can you break me off a single other knife based snack?

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Peanut butter crackers.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, no, it's like it's like cheese block.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Cheese block. Yeah, yeah.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you sharing cheese?

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, I'm not.

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Fruit. We covered that.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Loaf of bread.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You bring a loaf and a knife sharing.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bring two slices.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's your snack.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
An odd snack, perhaps, but a snack it may be.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Did you think about afterwards like I should have cut this at home?

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Probably. I'm going to say probably. That probably crossed their mind.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you had a big Ziploc bag of wedges, you definitely would not be getting hassled for that.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, here's what you do. A bunch of individual Ziploc bags of one wedge.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
With your name on every bag.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You eat the wedge and then you bite another one like, didn't they already?

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They definitely already had one.

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is my first watermelon course and then my second watermelon course.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What I've done is I've created myself a feast of watermelon nine ways.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Fruit's your favorite food?

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There's a lot of wicked, good, not fruit-based food out there.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Also, it's your favorite food group and that's an answer.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But if I said what's your favorite food and you said fruit, I'd be like, you've got to narrow that down.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But wait, I say my favorite food is cereal.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, that's...

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But that's a variation because I could say my favorite food is steak and you could cook a steak different ways or put different toppings on top of it.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's like my wife says her favorite food's soup, but she doesn't say her favorite food is liquid.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's what I'm saying. Thank you.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What's your favorite food? Beverage.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They do sell personal watermelons. I know I've seen them at the Kroger.

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Cha Cha Fancy Kroger, not the Bag Kroger on First Street. The Good Kroger.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And they have watermelons there that are just personal. They're called personal watermelons.

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's very helpful. Thank you, Justin.

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm just saying if you want to...

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So if you find yourself in Huntington, that's where to find the small watermelons.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't go to the Bad Kroger on First Street or the Fifth Avenue Kroger, but I shouldn't need to tell you that.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I say I actually envy it a little bit because my wife and I were talking about this the other day.

239
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My wife? My wife. When we buy a watermelon because our kids say they like watermelon and they like it to a point.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And unfortunately that point is not finished.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Right? And so it's like, oh, I do want some watermelon and the rest is for the gods.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And I know we have a policy of not giving each other parenting advice,

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but I think it's kind of messed up that you do make them eat the rind and everything.

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Now, Griffin, it's so funny that you should say make them.

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, I would say actively have to work to stop them from eating the rind as they go, I don't like this part.

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Um, um, um, um.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And we say, no one's making you.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I got in this bad, somehow the TikTok algorithm got fucked up for me.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I'm getting tons of videos about how to make jellies out of food scraps.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And it's like, use the watermelon rind and you can make a jelly out of this.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And it's always some charming woman with a Southern accent.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She's like, anyway, you got a bunch of corn cobs.

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't throw those corn cobs away.

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's like, can I please throw the corn cobs away?

255
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't, I, now I have every time I eat corn, I am now going to be burdened with a half second of like, should I?

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hold on.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is perfectly good jelly I'm basically tossing.

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm throwing away jelly ingredients.

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Between Facebook videos and TikTok, my aspirations have reached that point of like,

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
listen, I'd love to be the kind of person who did something with corn cobs.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I used to have dreams and that's what I started to give it.

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They should have a service where someone comes and picks up your corn cobs and makes jelly out of them for you.

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ethical sort of corn cobs.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, ethical, corn based.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Farm to table and then back to farm.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They drive an ethanol fueled car and they just, okay.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The office I work at is pretty small and laid back.

268
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So my coworkers will occasionally bring their dogs or cats in for the day.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a great way to brighten up an otherwise tedious workday.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I obviously want to get in on the fun.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And while I don't have a dog or cat, I do have a four foot long ball python.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait, he is very polite.

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It says right there.

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Excuse me.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Excuse me.

276
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What? Oh yeah.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If I may.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If I may, your mouse looks delicious.

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is anyone going to eat this mouse?

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
No, I don't want to slither on any toes.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What are your thoughts on snakes in the workplace?

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Should I do this?

283
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Also, what's the best way to sneak a reptile onto public transit?

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's from the snake whisperer in South Boston.

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Are you here?

286
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are there six of you?

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
A lot of snake people in the workplace.

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, listen, two things about the second part of that question.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do not sneak a snake onto a bus.

291
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I would much rather see a human being carrying it above their head

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
than suddenly look over and be like, well, there's a snake I wasn't expecting to see there.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Also, I've ridden public transit a lot.

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They won't stop you from bringing a snake on a bus.

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No way. Especially not if you put a little hat on him.

296
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, that was also my answer for the office part.

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Put a little hat on him.

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No matter how upset you got.

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, what a gentleman.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Put this little hat.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, hello little snake Lincoln.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In fact, a monocle would take it one step up.

303
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's ridiculous.

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're right. You know I said it and I felt it? Too far.

305
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're going to have to glue it on and that's immoral.

306
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, they would shed the skin that the hat is glued to so it's all okay in the end.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So that's kind of like temporary.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And you can also do a little elastic strap around the bottom and he's going to love that.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's going to come off in the first bath you give him though.

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, you're not giving him a bath at work, Justin. Don't be silly.

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's right. That's true. That's a good point.

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't mind if you bring a snake.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Sure. Huh.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That wasn't what I thought your answer would be.

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In the workplace?

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'd rather you bring a snake.

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, you don't know what the job is to be fair.

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm saying if I brought a snake on stage, since this is our workplace.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's very generous. Thank you.

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't fuck with snakes. It's fine.

321
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do you think that that was a weird conversation, Jake the snake?

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I had to have a lot of like, and you guys are okay.

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is everybody okay with this?

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is everybody fine if I bring a snake in? Because it's kind of my thing.

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But if not, I get it.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I will say this. I'll be Jake the Rake tonight.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I will say this.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you bring a snake with a hat on the screen.

329
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why does he look like he belongs in a Wes Anderson film?

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I believe you mean Wes Anderson.

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's what Paul is doing instead of refilling my drink.

332
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Paul.

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If you bring a dog in the workplace and someone's like, how's it go?

334
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And you're like, it didn't go great.

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That means that the dog peed on the carpet.

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you bring a snake into the workplace and someone says, how did it go?

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you said, not great. It ate the dog.

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, is what happened on that one.

339
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It did strangle Jon Voight a little bit.

340
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No big deal.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think the snake's fine. I'm not bothered by snakes.

342
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can I tell you what's messing me up, Justin?

343
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What's up? Don't bring a mouse?

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I know what animal one could bring that would mess you up.

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And I know what animal one could bring that would mess me up.

346
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I got no idea.

347
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sorry. I have no fear.

348
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey, Griffin?

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey, Griffin? That's patently untrue.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What animal, if you walked on stage, right?

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If there's a spider of any size, a mouse.

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There's a mouse rat, like, rodent.

353
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I've seen Justin, big, small, whatever.

354
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It doesn't matter. It's off.

355
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll give each one of them a sweet little kiss.

356
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So what's the thing that you came out?

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm not going to tell you.

358
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I'm certainly not going to tell...

359
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, you know too much about Justin and I.

360
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's too much. The imbalance is palpable.

361
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes!

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The snake is the natural enemy of the mouse.

363
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't like mice.

364
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And the spider, I'm pretty sure.

365
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

366
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And Jon Voight. I'm terrified of that, dude.

367
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I knew it!

368
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So if you came out and there was a Jon Voight on the table...

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I shit my pants.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I live at the corner of a very busy intersection.

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And there's a bus stop directly in front of my steps.

372
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Snake people, keep getting off of it in droves.

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Wait, hold on. People with snakes or snake people?

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is there a difference?

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah.

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm just kidding, snake people. Go for it.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Chase your dream.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Which one?

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes!

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I live at the corner of a very busy intersection.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And there's a bus stop directly in front of my steps.

382
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Whenever I order food, I ask the delivery person to leave it on the porch.

383
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
When I come out to get the food, there are usually several people facing me as I walk out.

384
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What?

385
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So they're just standing at the bus stop.

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I assume the street is away from your house.

387
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But they're all turned.

388
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're getting hung up on geography.

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You need a diagram.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They're chanting my name in harmony for saying...

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Omom Shabbat.

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ok, ok.

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The other day, an old man saw me do this and said...

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What do you got there?

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Pizza?

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Nice.

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What do you got there?

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Pizza?

399
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Nice.

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
May I take a run on that?

401
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What do you got there?

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Pizza.

403
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nice.

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Real nice.

405
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Should I... Sorry, Noid.

406
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Better luck next time.

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I saw right through your old man disguise, Noid.

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Wait, your face isn't coming off, Noid.

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh God, it did come off.

410
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Should I pretend I don't notice the people standing less than ten feet away?

411
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Or would that make it worse?

412
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's from the food goblin of Waltham, Massachusetts.

413
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Are you here?

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Wait, are you here?

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yup.

416
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just realized that someone who asked this question probably doesn't want the eyes of thousands of strangers suddenly...

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What are you watching? My brother and me? Nice.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Nice.

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You could do what I imagine or I've been told or I've seen in videos that like actual celebrities do...

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
When there's like paparazzi and people outside their house on like Hollywood tours and they come out to get their paper.

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You come out and you get your pizza or whatever and you just go like...

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm just like you.

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Hi, it's me. The guy you wanted food to hear.

424
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I got Duncan too. Just like everybody else.

425
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Just like you.

426
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You could do what my son Henry does whenever somebody asks him a question he doesn't want to answer.

427
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Which is that you do your best Shrek voice.

428
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And you say, get off my swamp!

429
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So, Griffin FaceTimed with Rachel before the show and we were talking about going to the aquarium today.

430
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And Henry started telling Rachel about seeing the Shreks at the aquarium.

431
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And then Rachel asked like, did they do tricks? And Henry said, no, they just slapped each other.

432
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They just slapped each other was his answer.

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Which is like, yeah, that's what a bunch of Shreks at an aquarium would do.

434
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They would probably just slap each other quite a bit while shouting, get out my swamp.

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hey, I'm just going to say, I really think that, and I know we spent a lot of money to build it.

436
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This Shrek enclosure was a mistake.

437
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Shreks should be in the water.

438
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let Shreks run free.

439
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is what I'm saying.

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Were there really Shreks at the aquarium?

441
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah, you missed them.

442
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There was penguins in one section and then Shreks in another, but they had to keep the donkeys really far away.

443
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

444
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Do you know what kind of donut Shrek loves?

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What kind, Travis?

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Donkeys.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's fucking nothing, dude.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is my favorite part of our podcast, which is where I make Travis tell three more Shrek jokes.

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He took off the crown, which is an acknowledgement.

450
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This part's not for you.

451
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's for me.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know what the most awkward part of being an ogre parent is?

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What's that, Travis?

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Having the Shreks talk.

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Thank you.

456
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Y'all are going to freak the fuck out when you see how fast my cool brother Travis thinks of two more good Shrek jokes.

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You're going to be like-

458
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait, hold on. Hold on to your asses.

459
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey, did you hear why the Shrek got overwhelmed by bills?

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Why, Travis?

461
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They were swamped!

462
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm going to say you need two more Shrek jokes.

463
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Fuck, that was one!

464
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
No, one and a half.

465
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Okay, I'll do one and a half. I'll give you that.

466
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Tell half of one more Shrek joke.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And this one can just be a setup and you don't have to do the punchline.

468
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Everyone get right here.

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All right, all right, all right.

470
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because they were stalking them.

471
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh, yeah. What was it?

472
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't know, but I don't like it.

473
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I know.

474
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Do you know why Shreks love onions?

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Why, Travis?

476
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They appeal to them.

477
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fucking hell, man.

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You didn't say they had to be good jokes.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That air horn was ill.

480
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, it was sick.

481
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It was a sick and broken air horn.

482
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's a living.

483
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't want to be ageist up here, but you'll notice that once you get old, you'll just say whatever.

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's all I want, Justin.

485
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Whatever hoes into your brain at that moment, you'll just say.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Especially if you get a bunch of old people together.

487
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Four.

488
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Four specifically.

489
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Four old people together get so rowdy.

490
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I was waiting for the elevator at the hotel to go back.

491
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I had just gotten a breakfast to enjoy by myself without my children.

492
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Very much looking forward to it, honestly.

493
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Just a donut you won't have to bite a bite off of to get it.

494
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I bought this for me.

495
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm waiting there, and a sweaty guy runs up to me, and it's like, fine.

496
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We all get it, pal.

497
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay, you're exercising.

498
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Wait, you're not going to give context.

499
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He probably was working out.

500
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's exercise.

501
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We're not in an I'm on the run from the government kind of sweaty, right?

502
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't know that.

503
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I just wait.

504
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You don't.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You don't have that.

506
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Travis, I love you.

507
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Just please let me tell this not very good story.

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So the sweaty guy runs up to me.

509
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No problem.

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Then four old people just roll up in like a wolf pack, like an old person wolf pack,

511
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and they're like, walk up to this dude, and they're standing there at the elevator.

512
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They managed to wait all of five seconds, restrained themselves before the lady who

513
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think was their leader looks at this guy, and it's like somebody's been exercising.

514
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Can you give this guy anything?

515
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Give him something to respond to that is some sort of prompt that requires a response.

516
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Then immediately the terror starts to seep into my heart.

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I've just got a big bag of waffles and eggs.

518
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The last thing I need is these old people interrogating me.

519
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, looks like somebody's eating good or the classic.

520
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hope you got enough to share.

521
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh, God.

522
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because then you're like, I don't, but should I say that?

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't, but should I be like, I have an English muffin I'm probably not going to need.

524
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Do you guys like loose pads of butter?

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I don't know what it is.

526
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
They feel so empowered when you get four older people together.

527
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's fantastic.

528
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Good for them.

529
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
They've earned that.

530
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Good for them.

531
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Today I was at the Old North Church.

532
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I sat down with my daughter for one second, and I heard behind me, purple, huh?

533
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I looked, and there was just an old man with a very big camera in his hands.

534
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then he proceeded to say nothing else.

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Excellent.

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Excellent.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So all he gave me was purple, huh?

538
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
A color and a sound.

539
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You get to an age where you feel like talking, but don't feel like listening.

540
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah.

541
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And these are the things that you say.

542
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I want to say something right now, but I don't want to hear what the person says back to me.

543
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
One day I will be old enough to think, I just want to say something that haunts someone for months.

544
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, I want someone to talk about this on a podcast.

545
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm a shorebird monitor on Martha's Vineyard.

546
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
A what?

547
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
A shorebird monitor, brag, on Martha's Vineyard.

548
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So my job requires me to interact with a lot of beach nesting birds who are very much not chill with me.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

550
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Some particularly aggressive birds will even dive bomb my head with their razor sharp beaks, and it's pretty intimidating.

551
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
How do I communicate to the birds that I'm a cool person who doesn't want to eat their babies,

552
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and that I'm here to protect them?

553
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's what you would say.

554
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That's from Bird Brain in Oak Bluffs.

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Are you here?

556
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
All right, all right.

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And you definitely won't eat their babies, you promise.

558
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Thank you on behalf of all the birds.

559
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Hold on, can you promise you're not going to?

560
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Before we can address this, we need a solemn vow.

561
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You are not going to eat any shorebird babies.

562
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If there's like a.0001% chance you might eat their babies, you have to say so.

563
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Just scream at the top of your lungs, I promise not to eat the babies.

564
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That wasn't what he said.

565
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's not what I said.

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
My pinky is down here, it's meaningless.

567
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's too late now.

568
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm going to tell the birds.

569
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The birds are wise to dislike you, you're a human.

570
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah.

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I bet pretty much all animals but dogs agree we're the worst.

572
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Of the animals there are, right?

573
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Humans are the worst, the worst ones.

574
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And I guarantee there's even some dogs that are like, I think they're okay.

575
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think they're all right, but they don't say it to other animals.

576
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Hey, I'm not getting down with this bit, man.

577
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm proud to be a human.

578
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You are?

579
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because I drink Coca-Cola with my mouth.

580
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Got opposable thumbs to play Xbox.

581
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I drive my bike down south and I proudly stand up next to you, my human friends and kids.

582
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I said I'm proud to be a human.

583
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
God bless the USA.

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, that's good.

585
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You know what?

586
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Actually, Griffin's changed my mind.

587
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay.

588
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
No.

589
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I made a lot of good points.

590
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
A lot of solid points there.

591
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You need to walk under these birds, look them right in the eye and say, I'm the alpha now.

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

593
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
1v1 me and Halo, oh wait, you can't.

594
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You're a bird.

595
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No, Justin, I don't want to hear it.

596
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You're going to make these birds look like dumb shits.

597
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You're flustered over there because you know I kicked ass with my good song.

598
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And I know which side of the bread I'm buttered on.

599
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
One bird could say to another, I don't know, Sheila's not that bad.

600
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And then the second bird says, you realize that her species made the ones of us couldn't fly, fuck more to make nuggets easier.

601
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You know that's the kind of species we're talking about, right?

602
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And she was like, that's actually a pretty good point.

603
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, counterpoint.

604
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

605
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Turns out that human knows where to buy sunflower seeds.

606
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
They can just get them.

607
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Hey, get these guys all the time.

608
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Even like, I was like, I don't even think there's a sunflower over there.

609
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But then boom, they rode on and you know what?

610
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They were barbecue flavored and it was fucked up.

611
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't know what teriyaki is, but they are on to something.

612
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It fucking ruled, dude.

613
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Hey, you guys ever heard of bread?

614
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This earth has got it.

615
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
They're great.

616
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, so we turned some of you into nuggets, but also teriyaki flavor.

617
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's all humans.

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
They turn our babies into breakfast, but also sun chips.

619
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Hi everybody.

620
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Hey, it's us on stage live.

621
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, not live.

622
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No, the house is empty and we're recording an ad read and I'm now feeling the weirdest energy I've ever felt.

623
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We're here to tell this very haunted casino about stamps.com.

624
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
When you need to mail something and you're going to go to the post office and you think, I can't.

625
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I can't.

626
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Not today.

627
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Not today.

628
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Certainly.

629
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I've gone the last 15 days in a row.

630
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If I go again, they're going to think I'm weird.

631
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You can head to stamps.com instead where you can save time, save money.

632
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You got all the access to the post office and UPS shipping services right from your personal computer.

633
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And you get discounts you can't find anywhere else like up to 30% off USPS rates.

634
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And get this, you're going to plots 86% off UPS.

635
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's the sound I make when I plot.

636
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, Griffin just plots everywhere.

637
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Stop wasting time and start saving money when you use stamps.com to mail and ship.

638
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Sign up with promo code mybrother for a special offer that includes a four-week trial plus free postage and a digital scale.

639
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I've never done this in an auditorium before.

640
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I feel like I am defecating on this stage in front of strangers.

641
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's so strange.

642
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
No long-term commitments or contracts.

643
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone at the top of the page and enter code mybrother.

644
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Hey, I can't believe it's taking me this long to use this intro for this company.

645
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But do you want your fancy to take flight?

646
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh, okay.

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Right? It's right there.

648
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Because Stitch Fix will help you get your whole look in order.

649
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I mean, they mostly hook me up with the board shorts that I crave, which is not especially.

650
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, now.

651
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I mean, Stitch Fix, they provide high-quality clothing that matches your style, budget and size.

652
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But also, if you need clothes to just be sort of a nasty skater boy.

653
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Just to scuzz around in.

654
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But then they can do that for you as well.

655
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I think that they read my mind actually because for a while they were sending me like,

656
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
oh, here's like a blazer and we're going to give trousers.

657
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No, no.

658
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And then it's suddenly been like, hey, do you want some like hyper-color shorts that could be trunks or shorts?

659
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We get it, man.

660
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Here you go.

661
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Wear those.

662
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They're going to send you five pieces of clothing.

663
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're going to check them out, try them on and you keep whatever you like.

664
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What you don't like, you send straight back to them.

665
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Shipping returns, exchanges.

Hello, I'm a stuffy Dowager Countess.

672
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Travis?

673
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm judging everybody's manners.

674
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, no.

675
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Trainers isn't judgy.

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's about teaching you to be your best self and be a little more confident when you enter social situations that you don't understand.

677
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And maybe also teach you a little bit about history you didn't know or give you interesting things to talk about at parties.

678
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah.

679
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like the secret life of Emily Post.

680
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Or like why wristwatches are the way that they are.

681
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We can talk about table manners from the Victorian era.

682
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Sure.

683
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Or what it's like to attend a Regency ball.

684
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah.

685
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You can find all that and more if you listen to shmanners on Maximum Fun or wherever your podcasts come from, I guess.

686
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Manner shmanners.

687
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Get it?

688
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
A man was walking along a beach which represented his life.

689
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
At his feet were two sets of footprints, his and God's.

690
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But looking back down the beach, the man could see that in the hardest parts of his life, there was only one set of footprints.

691
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So the man said to God, why is there only one set of footprints when times were hard?

692
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Where were you?

693
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And God replied, my precious child, I was in my car listening to the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

694
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The Beef and Dairy Network podcast is a multi-award winning comedy podcast and you can find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

695
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Alert! Alert!

696
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
There's a haunted doll watch! Alert! Alert!

697
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Should we go?

698
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No, we're safe here, I think.

699
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Let's me, don't do the picture yet, Paul.

700
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Save the picture.

701
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I just want to tell you all a little bit about today's subject.

702
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
There's a sort of preamble to the description.

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Thanks for visiting us.

704
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We'd like to make you aware that we put 10 days shipping so we can perform a goodbye session with each vessel.

705
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
A what?

706
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Positive or negative to let them know where they're going.

707
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Wait, a negative?

708
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There's a negative?

709
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Get the fuck out!

710
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Sorry, Samantha, but his profile makes him seem like a real stinker.

711
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's about to get real bad for you out there.

712
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We mark items as shipped while doing this.

713
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Some spirits take longer than others to say goodbye.

714
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This is a person that does not like going to the post office.

715
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Okay, so let's talk about Rav.

716
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Rav.

717
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Wow.

718
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Wow.

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Wow.

720
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That ain't it.

721
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Rav is-

722
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No!

723
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Can we get an enhance on Rav?

724
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We don't need an enhance on Rav.

725
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
No!

726
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Hey, let's see.

727
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm going to say fourth word in the Rav title was unnecessary from that picture.

728
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, Rav is-

729
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Did you guys see the production stills from the new Barbie movie?

730
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah.

731
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I found them challenging.

732
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We're challenging to say the least.

733
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This is Rav.

734
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Rav, if you're listening later, is what looks to me like a naked boy Bratz doll with tiny feet.

735
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Footless.

736
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No feet.

737
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Okay.

738
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Rav's a sexual demonic spirit that is wanting to find someone who is highly charged like him.

739
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Oh, God!

740
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Rav likes to be your one and only.

741
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Oh, boy.

742
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If he could, he would show you off to the world.

743
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
He will fall in love with you.

744
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Rav will protect you with all he has.

745
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
He won't let anyone hurt you.

746
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Rav likes to lay in bed with you and-

747
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Nope.

748
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And watch films.

749
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And you watch films with Rav.

750
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What kind of films?

751
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You will-

752
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, it doesn't matter, Trev, because you will feel him place his hands on you in a sexual manner.

753
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Obviously!

754
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He's certainly not going to place his feet on you.

755
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Oh, Rav.

756
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Tell-

757
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Did fucking Sid from Toy Story make Rav?

758
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Tell him what you want to do.

759
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Guide him to your weak spots and he will remember what you like.

760
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
She does!

761
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Right!

762
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Ah!

763
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He's back there, too!

764
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Rav shows himself as a heavy-built man with strong arms and muscles.

765
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
His skin glistens with sweat.

766
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Now, they're just describing the doll at this point.

767
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, boy.

768
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Sorry.

769
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes, that's a very good sign.

770
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm more interested in the tablecloth, which-

771
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Do we have a close-up on what's going on?

772
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We'll work on that.

773
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Bottom right corner, especially.

774
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Bottom right corner looks like the cover of a babysitter's club book.

775
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think it's a Ouija board.

776
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It is, but it's like two-

777
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It almost looks like two parents like,

778
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This is fun.

779
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay, so they-

780
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The way you will see him will be in visions, dreams, nightmares, and meditation state.

781
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I once meditated so hard, my doll tried to have sex with me.

782
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's a normal thing.

783
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah.

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, you're yelling.

785
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That would put David Lynch off of meditation.

786
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
He will also manifest around the helm, but only you will see and feel him.

787
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I was hoping he would do some chores as long as he was there.

788
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Big strong man like that.

789
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
He isn't keen on sharing.

790
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Stop it, Paul.

791
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's a close zoom there, Paul.

792
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
He isn't keen on sharing.

793
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Tell me your weaknesses.

794
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Tell me your weaknesses, I'll remember what you like.

795
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He would rather have you all to himself.

796
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah, I know that about him.

797
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Stop it, Paul.

798
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A feeling of not being alone is common with Raul.

799
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Paul, go to jail.

800
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh wait, right there in the doll's eye, it's the moment of Paul's death.

801
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Whoa, I can see it.

802
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It's going to be soon if he keeps this up.

803
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
A feeling of not being alone is common with Rav.

804
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
He likes you to know where he is, there with you, no matter what you are doing.

805
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Communication with Rav has been Ouija board, spirit dance, spirit box.

806
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Man, if you come over and you see your aunt spirit dancing to communicate with her sexy doll, that's pretty much it.

807
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You know you're in for the weirdest summer of your life.

808
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey, that new Neil Simon play is real strange.

809
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Spirit dance, spirit box, manifestation, loud bangs.

810
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Thank you, Rav.

811
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't mind if I do.

812
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Ooh la la.

813
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ooh la la.

814
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And scratching around the home.

815
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Alright, Rav and a gerbil have that in common. Excellent.

816
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Hey, what's that? Is that a squirrel on your walls?

817
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
These spirits will need time to see you and know what you're about.

818
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Please be patient with him.

819
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
When he arrives, light the candle, welcome him into your home.

820
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
This is a bonding process.

821
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We have excellent feedback.

822
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
On Rav?

823
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
This is our 15th Rav.

824
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And I think I speak for everyone here when I say we really nailed it this time.

825
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This one's even Ravier than the last.

826
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So that's Rav.

827
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Rav is available for 23 sterling.

828
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Listen, I know it's too late now, but don't buy Rav.

829
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Rav costs 23 pounds and it costs 56 pounds to ship his incredible huge muscular body.

830
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't buy Rav.

831
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
No, they're gonna buy Rav.

832
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Someone already buys Rav.

833
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Somebody already buys Rav.

834
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Someone always buys Rav, so that is our Haunted Doll Watch for this week.

835
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Thank you. Keep your eyes peeled for Rav.

836
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay, we have asked you all to send in your questions to be addressed live.

837
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Please understand that what we can see right now is like a shadow meeting us in a parking garage to give us government secrets.

838
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And so please understand that's the dynamic we have with you.

839
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I understand.

840
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hello. Oh no.

841
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Are you Brendan?

842
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I am Brendan, yes.

843
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hi, Brendan.

844
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Okay, I want to start by saying my mother-in-law is a wonderful person.

845
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
She's like a kickass.

846
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is such a good start, Brendan.

847
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
No, no. She's like this old-school kickass feminist.

848
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
She rules, okay?

849
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

850
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But...

851
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But whenever she texts, she likes to use a lot of abbreviations.

852
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And she will save every character she can.

853
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
She... She spells the word come, C-U-M.

854
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
No.

855
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

856
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Because that could be the correct spelling based on what she's talking about.

857
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yes, context is, oh my God, the most important.

858
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I have some examples.

859
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Sure.

860
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yes.

861
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Like just some texts we've gotten from over the years.

862
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
What time should we come?

863
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Uh-huh.

864
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And can we just say sting like control at that point?

865
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah.

866
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And the answer is always 8-0-2.

867
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Should we bring snacks when we come?

868
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I mean, it's polite.

869
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It is a nice thing to do.

870
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Not sure... Not sure if your father will come.

871
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's nice to have an honest understanding of Warren Jones' ability.

872
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Open sexual conversations with your mother-in-law.

873
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's progressive.

874
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Listen, sometimes I'm phoning it in.

875
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So how do I make her stop?

876
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
How do you make her keep going forever and ever and ever?

877
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Forever and ever and ever?

878
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Hey, Brennan.

879
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Brennan, I'm going to ask you an honest question and I want an honest answer.

880
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah, sure.

881
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Has there ever been a text message where you were confused about the actual intention of it?

882
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Or did you always know what she meant?

883
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I hope I always knew what she meant.

884
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Then you don't have to fix it.

885
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah, this is...

886
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's a great thing for you to enjoy.

887
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That is both clear communication and something you can share with friends.

888
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No, no, no.

889
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Hold on.

890
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Here comes the fun police over here.

891
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
No, it's not the fun police.

892
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's just Brennan is probably not the only human this person has texted.

893
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, shit.

894
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
They're texting, like, the pool guy.

895
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's like, hey, I'm coming in the pool right now.

896
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Hold on.

897
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Wait, what?

898
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
When will you come, pool man?

899
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Will you come in my house?

900
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I mean, there's a lot of opportunities here.

901
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Can I just say...

902
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Hey, are you going to come all over the place?

903
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Can I just say that as a sexual proposition, when will you come is a really confusing one of them.

904
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What's the rush?

905
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Relax.

906
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Don't do it.

907
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Brennan.

908
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yes, sir.

909
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Is the relationship you have with his mother-in-law such that if you said, hey, you know that the spelling of that means something else, would she laugh or would she be so embarrassed you could never see her again?

910
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I think she'd be very confused.

911
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But allegedly, her son, my brother-in-law, has raised this with her before, but to no effect.

912
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay, not your job.

913
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You're fine.

914
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You're fine then.

915
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Congratulations, Brennan.

916
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I just elevated this to not your problem.

917
00:46:45,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Can I just, though, let me devil's advocate this for your mother-in-law, and I guess everybody else's mother-in-law, that spelled the correct way still means the thing, so...

918
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Less obviously, though.

919
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah, I guess that's right.

920
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No, but also, we just talked earlier about how we can't wait to get old so we can say things that people talk about forever.

921
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I could see me being a father and mom, like, they think I don't know.

922
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm cool.

923
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I live in the 60s.

924
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Does that help, Brennan?

925
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh, sure, yeah.

926
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it, but thank you for being here.

927
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, man.

928
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Thank you.

929
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Thank you so much.

930
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Thank you, Jupiter, for sanitizing the microphone.

931
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's incredible work.

932
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Jupiter!

933
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Jupiter, everybody.

934
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Jupiter's on our team.

935
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Jupiter rules.

936
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Hello.

937
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Hi.

938
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
A lot of places can't afford a full-time microphone sanitizer, but that's the kind of show we do.

939
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Hi.

940
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Hi, I'm Shayla.

941
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
My pronouns are she, hers.

942
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Hello.

943
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And my question is, tomorrow is Father's Day, and I haven't gotten my dad a Father's Day gift.

944
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You are all dads.

945
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
What should I get him?

946
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I am currently wearing my Father's Day present from my family.

947
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's these incredible jeans.

948
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I was in another room, and I heard my wife talking to my children about what we should get daddy for Father's Day.

949
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And my daughter, Baby, said, I know, she's five, a nesting doll.

950
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And at first I was like, what?

951
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then she said, get this, because my daughters are genius, the biggest doll looks like daddy, the inside doll looks like mommy,

952
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
a smaller doll looks like me, and the smallest doll looks like dot.

953
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Right?

954
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And I was like, holy shit, dude.

955
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I know it's a little cliche, but kids really do say the darnedest things.

956
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because I think me and my wife are totally ready to dunk on her.

957
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

958
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We were so ready to be like, you dumb piece of shit.

959
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Travis.

960
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I know.

961
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Announcement.

962
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I know the perfect gift for every dad.

963
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
A grill.

964
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
No.

965
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Nope.

966
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Here it is.

967
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You ready?

968
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah.

969
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah.

970
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
A stud finder.

971
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Now, why is that the perfect gift for every dad?

972
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
One, you lose the damn things all the time.

973
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
God, yes.

974
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You have to go searching for it.

975
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's annoying.

976
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You can have a stud on every floor of your house.

977
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Two, it gives your dad the opportunity to take it out of the package, put it on himself, and say it's working.

978
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Which is shit, dad.

979
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And let me tell you, in the operating room, when Henry was born, the nerves I felt, it's indescribable.

980
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Literally, you feel your life change when you hear the sound of your baby making the first sounds for the first time.

981
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And also, this thing happens in your brain where you're like, a stud finder joke would be pretty fucking funny right now.

982
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, right?

983
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I can't explain it.

984
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
A thing clicked over in my brain where it was like, think of all the things you could fit a cow joke into.

985
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's so much.

986
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's constant.

987
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's like, moo fits into so much.

988
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It sounds like so many great words.

989
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Um, cash.

990
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah.

991
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I think I already crushed it.

992
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I feel like stud finder.

993
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
We're all kind of agreed on a stud finder.

994
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I think a stud finder is really cool.

995
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Hey, listen.

996
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,000
My friends who are a bit younger than me who are here, I know most of you are older than me, but for those of you that are younger than me, get yourself a stud finder if you don't have one yet.

997
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh my god.

998
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And have some.

999
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Sure, hang in your pictures like a pro.

1000
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Have some extra nine volts around because you never think about them because they're so weird.

1001
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But when you need one, oh Jesus.

1002
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You're thinking drywall anchors will get the job done, but the cavities they leave in the wall are unsightly.

1003
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh my god.

1004
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Does that help?

1005
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yes, that's perfect.

1006
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Thank you.

1007
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Do you want to talk more about stud finders and drywall?

1008
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Because they have them now.

1009
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
They have them now with a metal mode, and I just got this one with a built-in laser measure.

1010
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh, forget about it.

1011
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What's nice is that you can find the ones where they can detect wiring in the wall.

1012
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That's a safety hazard.

1013
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh my god, so important.

1014
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Let's keep that dad around.

1015
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I see someone nodding behind you.

1016
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, you don't want to zap that dad.

1017
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Don't let your dad get zapped.

1018
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I saw a TikTok recently, which my kids introduced me to, and someone drilled a hole in the wall,

1019
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and there was water sheeting out because they went right into a water pipe.

1020
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, I watched one where a dad drilled into a wall and got zapped and fucking died.

1021
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You could see a skeleton through his body.

1022
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And it was a TikTok stuff film, and it's still up.

1023
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You can watch it if you want to.

1024
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
If you Google totally dad fails, you'll find it.

1025
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If you Google, uh-oh.

1026
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Come on.

1027
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Come on.

1028
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Follow through.

1029
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
If you Google Zap Daddies, you'll find it.

1030
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I don't know if that helps you, but I bet it helps a lot of people in the audience.

1031
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Thank you so much.

1032
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just going to go to ZapDaddies.com real quick.

1033
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Justin, have you ever bought a URL on stage at a show before?

1034
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Hey, don't do it!

1035
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Don't, please don't.

1036
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That would be so rude.

1037
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Go ahead, guys, do your show.

1038
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Next, yes, hello.

1039
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Hello.

1040
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Hello.

1041
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What's your name?

1042
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Max.

1043
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hi, Max.

1044
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Hello, Max.

1045
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Can you just keep it down a little bit?

1046
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Sorry, Justin.

1047
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He's listening.

1048
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We'll scoot over there.

1049
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
That's fine, that's fine.

1050
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
He does this so much, he can use 10% of his mind to buy a URL.

1051
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You are racing over a thousand.

1052
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm on the limitless bill right now.

1053
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Max, what is your question?

1054
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
All right, so I have an issue.

1055
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It might be an issue, it might not be.

1056
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh, okay.

1057
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Well, 10 o'clock, 10.30 every night, no matter where I am, no matter what I'm doing,

1058
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I get really, really tired and start to fall asleep.

1059
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
All right?

1060
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1061
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But I fall asleep for like a half an hour.

1062
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I wake up after that half an hour.

1063
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm perfect.

1064
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
A little disco nap.

1065
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I was living with my parents where this wasn't an issue because they did the exact same thing.

1066
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah.

1067
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But now I'm a young person in the city and I go to events and parties and hang out with people.

1068
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And so now at around 10 o'clock when other young people are not falling asleep,

1069
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I need to take a little half hour power nap.

1070
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Sure.

1071
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And it's gotten to the point now where my friends have whole albums on their phone of me just asleep on the couch.

1072
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Hey, that fucking sucks, Max.

1073
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1074
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
No.

1075
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah.

1076
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't love it.

1077
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Hey, Max, can I stop you real quick?

1078
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, of course.

1079
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
How old are you?

1080
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I am 23.

1081
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh, you are actually a young person.

1082
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay.

1083
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah, no, I'm fairly young.

1084
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I was ready to have a tough conversation where it's like, if you had said like 28 or above,

1085
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I was like, yeah, no, hey, listen, it's time to brace yourself.

1086
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Hey, you heard it here, folks.

1087
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
If you're 28 or above, you have one foot in the fucking grave.

1088
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, dude.

1089
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Yes, Griffin.

1090
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I stand by that.

1091
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Okay, Max.

1092
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm glad it's coming to that realization in five years, but like I kind of have a little time.

1093
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, hey, Max, please.

1094
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
This wasn't your question.

1095
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Enjoy it while you fucking can.

1096
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Max.

1097
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Amanda, ZapDaddies.com costs $100.

1098
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Count by it on the company card.

1099
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yay.

1100
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
She's giving a big thumbs up, okay.

1101
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So is your question how to serve.

1102
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Amanda, it got declined.

1103
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Are we in trouble?

1104
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Everybody buy posters on your way out, okay?

1105
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
As many as you can carry, all right?

1106
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Can I just say, actually, if our bank was like this, we're not going to let you do this.

1107
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Good on our bank.

1108
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That's a fucking good bank.

1109
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That's a good bank.

1110
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Max, sorry.

1111
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yeah, my question is just how do I take a half hour nap without people finding out?

1112
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Sure, sure, sure.

1113
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So here's the good news, Max.

1114
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
All right.

1115
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Most people do not think about you as much as you think they do.

1116
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
No, hear me out, hear me out.

1117
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
This is a good thing.

1118
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You can disappear for a half hour.

1119
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
That's a good window of time before someone goes, where's Max?

1120
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
As long as if it's like three people hanging out, you say, I'm going to go snooze for 30 minutes.

1121
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So like that's fine.

1122
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But if you're like at a party or a club or something, you just need to find a pile of coats

1123
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
or some warm, dry hay, right, whatever, and just curl up on and sleep for a half hour, it's fine.

1124
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's okay.

1125
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I was going to suggest coat bed.

1126
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Coat bed is amazing.

1127
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yes.

1128
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The fact that they provide coat bed for any other purpose than having a secret nap in

1129
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
is outrageous to me because nothing's better.

1130
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
What's better than wearing one coat, being in a big pile of other people's coats?

1131
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Just tell everybody that you're getting really into meditation.

1132
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Is that why you do it?

1133
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Listen, I can't deal with your stuff right now, okay?

1134
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm really trying to get ZappedDaddies.com.

1135
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Do you live in the city?

1136
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Listen, we're just a small community of daddies that love the movie Zapped.

1137
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay.

1138
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
What was your answer to that?

1139
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I do live in Boston.

1140
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Okay.

1141
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So I don't, I mean, do you have a car?

1142
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I have a car, yeah.

1143
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
How do you know?

1144
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It was my grandmother's if that, not as fancy.

1145
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But I mean, is it, does it have enough room for you to go sleep in it?

1146
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It's a super outback.

1147
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's got a lot of room.

1148
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1149
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh yeah.

1150
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I love a super outback.

1151
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
My wife drives an outback.

1152
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Max, there's so many places to sleep in this big, beautiful world of ours.

1153
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And only a few of them are going to get you in trouble.

1154
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I just, I want to stop my friends from taking pictures of me while I'm taking my snooze.

1155
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, Max.

1156
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Hey, listen.

1157
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Hey, now we're going to move beyond the problem you asked about and the problem you need us

1158
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to answer.

1159
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yeah.

1160
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Do you want to reframe everything?

1161
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I was going to say, I think my question has transformed a little bit.

1162
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, look at this.

1163
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
How do I rebuild healthy relationships with the friends around me?

1164
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah.

1165
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
My friends are planning my death is the only thing.

1166
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay.

1167
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'm getting an error that says there's a problem fulfilling my order.

1168
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
If one of y'all bought ZapDaddies.com, respect.

1169
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Respect.

1170
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You did it.

1171
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Max, does anything we've said help so far?

1172
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We've given you so much good stuff.

1173
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That's all good, right?

1174
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah.

1175
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I mean, the thing is I already take all my friends' coats when we like go out.

1176
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Take their phones.

1177
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So I just, I think I just make a nest in kind of.

1178
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Here's what it is today.

1179
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm going to go lay down, put your phones in this bag and you magnet seal it so you're

1180
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
done.

1181
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yes.

1182
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Like you're a problematic comedian.

1183
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah.

1184
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Does that help?

1185
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That's incredibly helpful.

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Thank you.

1187
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Fantastic.

1188
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Thank you.

1189
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Okay.

1190
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
One more.

1191
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Who do we have here?

1192
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Looking very fancy behind you.

1193
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Look what the cat.

1194
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1195
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The mic must be sanitized.

1196
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh no.

1197
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Thank you, Jupiter.

1198
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Who the hell are you?

1199
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Who might you be?

1200
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
What's this all about?

1201
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Hello.

1202
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Hello.

1203
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Hi.

1204
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm Adrian Cowles.

1205
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Hi, Adrian Cowles.

1206
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Hi.

1207
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
How are you?

1208
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
How are you?

1209
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
How are you?

1210
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
How are you?

1211
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
How are you?

1212
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
How are you?

1213
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
How are you?

1214
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
How are you?

1215
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
How are you?

1216
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Adrian Cowles.

1217
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
What?

1218
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,280
I'm going to say Yahoo Enabler.

1219
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,520
Adrian Cowles.

1220
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,440
And now Wikihow Enabler, Adrian Cowles.

1221
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:47,220
Thank you for your years of hard work, Adrian.

1222
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:53,380
Now it's all come full circle.

1223
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:58,900
You sent in a couple of questions, which usually we frown on, but you're Adrian fucking Cowles,

1224
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,900
so...

1225
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,180
And also, you only know how to send in a couple of questions.

1226
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,100
You also know how to send in 15 questions, so you had one about cards.

1227
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:13,100
Yeah, so is there a statute of limitations on repossessing Yu-Gi-Oh cards from a child?

1228
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:18,580
Now, hold on, the way you just phrased that, Adrian, makes it sound like this kid is defaulted

1229
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,620
on a loan, and you need to go to their house and repossess their Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1230
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:28,460
Adrian, can you get right up on that microphone and tell us exactly why you gave your Yu-Gi-Oh

1231
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,860
cards away to a child in the first place?

1232
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,860
Uh, panic.

1233
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,860
Panic?

1234
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,860
So...

1235
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,860
Were you held up?

1236
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,140
Now, was the kid gonna beat you up?

1237
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,340
Well, so my dad had a colleague over, I was probably like, I don't know, 19, whatever,

1238
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,340
home from college.

1239
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,980
Did you just say the sentence, my dad had a child over?

1240
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,980
Colleague.

1241
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Colleague, okay.

1242
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:52,860
And they brought their kids who were like 10, and I was entertaining the children, I

1243
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,460
don't know, but they were in my room and they were like, what are those?

1244
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,580
And I had my like gold-sleeved Yu-Gi-Oh deck, and I was like, oh, those are my Yu-Gi-Oh

1245
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,780
cards, and they were like, can I have those?

1246
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:06,380
And I said, okay.

1247
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:11,300
I mean, listen, in fairness, I hadn't used them in a couple years, and I hadn't really

1248
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:16,260
thought about this until a child, I'm a teacher, this year was like, oh, Yu-Gi-Oh is really

1249
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,260
cool, huh?

1250
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,980
And I was like, it was.

1251
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,500
No, dude, it's back in a big way.

1252
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Yeah, it is back.

1253
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
It's weird.

1254
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Is it still?

1255
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Okay.

1256
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,860
So how do I get those back?

1257
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,320
How old would you guess that child is now?

1258
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,260
Probably like 18, I don't know.

1259
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,260
18?

1260
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,260
They don't have those cards.

1261
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,580
That's not a child anymore, Adrian.

1262
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,800
That's an adult who stole your Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1263
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,580
You have a legal case against this adult.

1264
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,260
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy, attorney of law.

1265
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,060
Did a kid steal your Yu-Gi-Oh cards six years ago?

1266
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,140
Through force and intimidation.

1267
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,500
Did you feel bullied in the moment, Adrian?

1268
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Maybe.

1269
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Just saying no is hard, and yeah.

1270
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,100
Do I have to find the kid that he gave them to now?

1271
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,100
Is that just the truth?

1272
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:09,780
It's like Toy Story 3 rules, my second Toy Story reference of the evening.

1273
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,300
Was he wearing like a little propeller hat and suspenders, and he's like, please, please,

1274
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Mr. Cowles.

1275
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,300
Please, Mr. Cowles.

1276
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,940
I just need these Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1277
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,300
Can I have your blue-eyes white dragon?

1278
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:30,620
Adrian, there's only one option for you, and I'm sorry to say it because it won't be easy.

1279
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:36,140
You're gonna need to buy a basic starter deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and you're gonna need to

1280
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,780
play this kid for all the marbles.

1281
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,700
It's time to duel!

1282
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:49,900
And he's gonna have all the choice cards, all the greatest Yu-Gi-Oh cards like Rizzo

1283
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:56,300
and Stone Guy, all the good ones.

1284
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:04,100
And you're just gonna have the basic ones like Bulbasaur and Dug, but you're gonna have

1285
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,700
to come out on top playing for all the marbles.

1286
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,300
High stakes, I know, but I think it's your only play.

1287
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,900
And you're gonna need to let the ancient spirit that lives within your brain come out so that

1288
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,420
you can defeat him.

1289
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,420
Or let your grandpa's ghost come out of a pyramid.

1290
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,460
I've never watched Yu-Gi-Oh, but I think that's what happens.

1291
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:26,980
Griffin and I are referencing the same thing from two different perspectives.

1292
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,980
Does that help, Adrian?

1293
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,980
Absolutely.

1294
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
Thank you, Adrian.

1295
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,780
You've helped us a great deal.

1296
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:37,020
And you all have helped us a great deal just now by being such a wonderful audience.

1297
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,340
Thank you so much for being here.

1298
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,660
We really very much appreciate you.

1299
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,640
Boston is always uniformly fantastic.

1300
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,000
We say this shit to a lot of cities.

1301
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,500
We especially mean it for you all.

1302
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,960
Boston has, every time we've done a show here, it has been incredible.

1303
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,220
Thank you to Jupiter and Rachel and Amanda, all of whom work for us and all of whom are

1304
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:01,500
fantastic and all of whom are here.

1305
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,500
And Paul.

1306
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,500
And Paul Saborin, who's a contractor, so it's not the same thing.

1307
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,700
And Alice.

1308
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,060
Without Alice, Theresa and I wouldn't have been able to do Schwaners.

1309
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,340
Alice watched her kids with Schwaners.

1310
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,660
Thanks to whoever got Zap Daddies for saving me from myself.

1311
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,660
I appreciate that.

1312
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:23,060
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life Is Better With You.

1313
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,060
Thank you to Liz Fernandez for my makeup and tiara.

1314
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:30,980
Thank you to the Wang Theater for being just the prettiest, the prettiest and best theater.

1315
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,980
So beautiful.

1316
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,980
Make sure you look as you're leaving.

1317
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:33,980
It's gorgeous.

1318
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:40,820
I was out here during mic check and just pointed over and said, the angels are eating fruit

1319
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,340
in that voice.

1320
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:46,900
Which was, for someone who didn't know what she was referencing, pretty confusing.

1321
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,900
Yeah.

1322
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,860
Griffin, I would love to hear an impression of Mark Wahlberg.

1323
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,740
Yeah, sure.

1324
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:00,300
Mark Wahlberg pitching his family on the idea of Wahlbergers for the first time.

1325
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

1326
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,460
What if we did it more Boston?

1327
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,620
My name is Justin Matkgery.

1328
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:14,060
Is he from Boston?

1329
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,340
That was not a word.

1330
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,340
That was not a word.

1331
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,340
That was not a word.

1332
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,340
I'm...

1333
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,340
Wait, wait.

1334
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Hold on, hold on.

1335
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,060
How do you like them apples, uh?

1336
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,260
Don't get...

1337
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,260
Don't get...

1338
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,340
My name's Justin Matkgery.

1339
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:32,020
Get out of my swamp.

1340
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,020
Get out of my swamp.

1341
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,020
I'm Ben Affleck!

1342
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,020
With my brother, my brother, we kiss.

1343
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,020
I'm Minnie Driver!

1344
01:04:38,020 --> 01:05:03,020
Square on the lips!

1345
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,020
It's better with you!
