1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,680
and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm your middle-est brother, and they call me Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,240
Well, my name's Griffin, and I'm here to say I forgot how to podcast in a major way.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,280
Uh, welcome to My Three Dads, a new podcast for dads, about dads.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
Okay, let me pitch an alternate title, alternate title.

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,680
Dadvice.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
Dadvice, that's not bad at all.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
No, it's actually, it's not-

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,320
Very bad.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
No, it's Dadvice, it's like Advice, but then I said it out loud,

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
it makes it sound like Miami Vice, but with Dad.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Well, yeah, it sounds like we're talking about vices for dads, which is just like,

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
you know, good Coke, Coke for me, thanks, I don't sleep anymore, so that's my Dadvice.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
I think we should talk about, I mean, like, today's first topic is just about sleeping,

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
so I want to talk about how everybody slept last night.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,640
I'll start, uh, I was at the Cincinnatian Hotel, and I slept on a, on a, I, I,

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,800
we ordered room service, some bread pudding and various ice creams,

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,080
and then I laid upon a feather bed, uh, with my wife and child, and slept 11 hours from, uh,

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,640
in an uninterrupted block from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,440
Hi, you're just coasting on that pud.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,840
I think that's an experience you guys can both relate to, just sleeping 11 hours.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,720
Uh, I was curious how you guys slept last night.

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,200
Well, Justin, I'll tell you, last night I slept for nine uninterrupted hours,

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,600
because my wife is a goddamn saint, and we have been, we have been trading off every other night,

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,440
so actually, night before last, I slept for a total of two hours.

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,800
Last night I slept for nine hours, three nights ago, nine hours.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
I've had this real rollercoaster sleep schedule that is fucking up my body.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,360
I went to bed at 10, and at 11 I got a text from my baby that was like, you up?

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Yo, fourth meal, yo, dads, dads, fourth meal.

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
It happened again, it happened again, right in my shorts.

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,240
Hey, big, hey, big update, you up?

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
I got legs.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,600
What?

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Yeah, it's crazy.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,920
That is 90% of the sounds my baby makes is like, whoa, or some equivalent of that, like,

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,880
have you seen this?

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
I think it's called a hand.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Like, that idea just, she won't shut up about it about two o'clock in the morning.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
So then I got a text at midnight that was like, hey, I know I just woke you up,

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
but there's another, I got, I thought of another thing.

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Like, I want to tell you about the womb.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
It was great in there.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,240
It's super cool in there.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Can you try to recreate that environment for me, and if you recreate it with,

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,200
without like landing it right within like 99% accuracy, I will scream at you.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
I will scream at you, and I will scream at, I will scream at mom forever.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
Um, no, I slept great.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
It's hard.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
Sometimes my baby wakes up at like 715, and I really wanted to sleep till 730.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
So it's really difficult.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Justin Tyler, I have, I have been in your home when your child was screaming.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,240
I don't want to hear this bullshit from you.

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
Those are the old days, Travis.

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,280
It's, I'm on easy street now.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
But I'll get there too, this attitude of yours as though you can't remember what it was like

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
to not sleep great.

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
I won't stand for it.

63
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah, no, that's not a good character.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
No, I, this is my new character, uh, that I'm going with.

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Uh, you know the secret, here's the secret, here's the secret, the secret is that I hired,

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,720
uh, Muldoon from Jurassic Park to come in and shoot her with a tranq dart every night.

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
Oh, is that, she's, now she is learning how to open doors.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
That part is true.

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,160
So Muldoon does have a little bit of a trouble tracking her down sometimes.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,640
And she's hunting in packs with my cats.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,040
So that, that's another one that is difficult.

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
But he does come in, just tranq her every night.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
She goes down real, I mean, we'll do her book.

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
We do the book in bed and the PJs.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,720
That's never enough.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
That's never enough because then we have to call Muldoon to come over.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
That raptor cocktail.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,520
I'll tell you what though, that's the trade-off is my baby owns my ass and Rachel's ass from

79
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,640
during the night times.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,680
But during the day times, it's like, what do you want to watch, baby?

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Because I hope it's Terrace House because that's what we're fucking watching.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,200
What do you want?

83
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
You want to watch Friday Night Lights?

84
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
Oh, you don't get a vote because you can't like do anything or say anything about it.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
But you have the opposite, I feel like.

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,640
Or it's like, what do you want to watch, Charlie?

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,600
It's like, oh damn, Pee-wee's Christmas special again.

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
Okay, all right.

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,920
Yeah, but that's a bad example because that rules.

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,920
But we watched it three times while I was in town for the TV show and I love that special.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,680
But you can only laugh at the magic screen as my cousin so many times.

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
And it should be clear when Griffin says when we're in town shooting, it was September.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,640
So we were jumping the gun a little bit.

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,000
I actually, a big thank you to A Sleepless Night with My Child.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,040
I played her, you know, like sound making mobile and it reminded me of the theme music

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
from Dark Cloud.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
And then I found that Dark Cloud was available on the PlayStation 4 store.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Bye bye, Travis.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
That's what I've been doing.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Goodbye, everybody.

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,400
I just remembered Dark Cloud existed.

102
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,080
That's, what else do we do on this one?

103
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,520
It's not going to be all dad stuff.

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,640
I know that there's probably legitimate fear that it's going to be all dad stuff.

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,240
It's really, it's not going to be all dad stuff because I'm honestly, I'm over it.

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
So like, I've moved way on.

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
And I'm way in denial about it.

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm trying real hard to pretend like I don't have a kid.

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm like, I can't see her right now.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
So she doesn't exist.

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Sure.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
So both of you are having some object permanence issues.

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,080
Yeah.

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm leaning way into it, baby.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Pass me that fucking Bud Light.

116
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Ka-chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
That's not just the theme song to Home Improvement.

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,640
And a lot of people don't know this, but anytime Tim Allen's involved in a project

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,720
and he plays a dad, then that has to be the theme song for it.

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
And he wrote it, obviously.

121
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,600
That was not the work of a master composer who's like,

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,640
well, all right, let me show you this fucking, let me show you this bar,

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
this sheet music and the notes just go down.

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
And then there's an, uh, at the end of it.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Just one more quick dad story.

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,360
We were visiting Travis and Teresa and his baby, Bebe.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
And the highlight of the trip for me is I taught Charlie how to say

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
she was going to kick Travis's ass.

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,680
Oh, good.

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
She just, she just followed Travis around the apartment saying,

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm going to kick your ass.

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah, very eloquently, too.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
Like, this was not like cute baby speak.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
She looked at me dead in the eye and was like, I am going to kick your ass.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
It was very intimidating.

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
The two are so tied in their house that when we got home,

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,920
we said, did you have a good time visiting with baby Bebe?

138
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
And she said, yeah.

139
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
And she said, and we said, and Teresa?

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,240
And she said, yeah.

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
And we said, and Uncle Travis?

142
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
She said, I'm going to kick his ass.

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
She's going to try.

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
She can fucking try.

145
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm way bigger than her.

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
Travis is a big man.

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm going to kick your ass.

148
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,120
She also spent the whole time just so that there is benefit to the dad stories.

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,440
She also kept like laying a hand on my baby and saying, so cute.

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
It was great.

151
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
She loves baby Bebe very much.

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm going to kick your daddy's ass.

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah, that was weird.

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
That was a bit of a turn off.

155
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,800
Here comes our first question.

156
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
Well, I want to say real quick because we, I wasn't here last week.

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,160
We did our best.

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,040
I think thanks to everybody for the well wishes.

159
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,480
We had a baby on Black Friday.

160
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
And everybody's doing really well.

161
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,040
So and a lot of people sent some nice tweets and messages and some nice stuff to our PO box.

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
And we really appreciate it.

163
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,400
So thanks, y'all.

164
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Here comes our first question.

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,040
My sister thinks it's normal to use the term

166
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,840
lovers to refer to a couple in casual conversation.

167
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,520
Our friend and I think this is pretty super gross.

168
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,920
How can we explain to her how nasty the word lovers is?

169
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,080
That's an off put in the OC.

170
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,960
Is your sister like, I think it was.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
Who is the woman who did the SNL bit with Will Ferrell?

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
Dratch.

173
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,120
Yeah, Rachel Dratch.

174
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
Is that what that's what we're dealing with?

175
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000
Like the whole premise of that.

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
We all lived through the 90s and early thousands, right?

177
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
Like we all saw that sketch.

178
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,280
Like we understand that it's off the table.

179
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,480
You realize there's people that exist right now who are 16 who don't remember anything

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
before 2000, right?

181
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,560
Shit.

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
That's a fair point.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
It's unacceptable.

184
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,960
You can't.

185
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,720
You simply can't because you say lovers and lovers means one thing.

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
And that is that they fuck all the time.

187
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,400
The only way you get to use that is if you see two people casually fucking each other.

188
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,480
Then you can say, look at those lovers.

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
Otherwise you are assuming.

190
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
It's not just that it's active.

191
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
It's active.

192
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
Like descriptor, right?

193
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,160
Like if I go to a barbershop and I see a man or a woman

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
cutting some hair so that there's a barber.

195
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
A lover suggests like this person does it like it's their job.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,960
These two people do it like it's their job.

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Wait, I'm going to stop you, Griffin, though,

198
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
because that would imply that if you saw him anywhere else,

199
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
he ceases to be a barber unless he is barbering.

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,840
No, if I've seen them barber, then I know I've classified them.

201
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,720
What Griffin's saying is not that he is forever cutting hair.

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,600
It's that he has achieved a level to where he can be called that as a professional.

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
I've seen it.

204
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
You're a barber.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Don't try and disguise it.

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,600
Lovers means like, hi, you might as well say like these are my friends,

207
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
you know, Derek and Michael.

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
They bone.

209
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,760
That's what's up.

210
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,680
That's what's up.

211
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I'm actually on the other side of this.

212
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,200
I've reached a time in my life where I'm old and irrelevant

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
and really the only way that I can try to get the upper hand in conversation.

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
Like I can't tell people about the new Weekend album because I haven't heard it.

215
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
But I can use uncomfortable words to try to set them off,

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,280
to try to get the power balance back into my level.

217
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,240
Do you remember?

218
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
You know what's interesting about this to me?

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
It just occurred to me, right?

220
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,560
Griffin and I at least draw on the same page that lovers is weird, right?

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm going to add one word to it that's going to change the way you feel about that.

222
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,480
You ready?

223
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,160
Young lovers.

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
No, bud.

225
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,880
Really?

226
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,080
Okay, see, I'm on the side of using young lovers as like a cute,

227
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,680
springtime, Twitter-pated, all befuddled about one another.

228
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
You look at those young lovers out for a stroll through the park.

229
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,960
I don't think saying look at those young lovers implies like...

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
No, bud.

231
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,280
No, bud.

232
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
No, bud.

233
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
It does.

234
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,000
No, it doesn't.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
No, wait.

236
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
Justin, hold on.

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
Hold on, Griffin.

238
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
Excuse me one second.

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
I really forgot to Justin.

240
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Justin, you have to be on my side about this.

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
You were on board with lovers.

242
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,920
If I feel young and...

243
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
I was on board with lovers because it made people uncomfortable.

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm fully in the camp.

245
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
Young lovers is worse because it's drawing attention to how old you are

246
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,240
and how you're an old person who shouldn't be saying such things.

247
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
I can think of a word that would go before lovers that would make it palatable,

248
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
and it is meat.

249
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Okay.

250
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I hear meat lovers and I say like, when?

251
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,360
Where?

252
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,080
Where?

253
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm there.

254
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
How much?

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Please no Canadian bacon.

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Please.

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,800
That's just ham.

258
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
You can't trick me.

259
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

260
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,240
Hit me.

261
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,080
This Yahoo was sent in...

262
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh man, I got a lot of good ones.

263
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
When you take a week off and...

264
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,960
Maybe we should switch to bi-weekly like Adventure Zone

265
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,480
because we get so much good stuff.

266
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
No, we shouldn't even joke about that.

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Okay, how about this one sent in by Ed Bauman.

268
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,640
Thank you, Ed.

269
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,960
It's Yahoo Answers user John who asks,

270
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,960
how do I stop people on Facebook from taking credit of my food pics?

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
I love sharing food pics,

272
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,600
and I am afraid people will save my pictures and pretend they made the food.

273
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
How can I avoid this from happening?

274
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,320
Hold on.

275
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,840
There's a real Chameleon twist in there.

276
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah, in that it's not happening.

277
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,240
It's an imaginary...

278
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not happening actively.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,680
He's just afraid it will happen.

280
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
This is not a thing that happens.

281
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,520
So here's what you do.

282
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
I'll just solve it for you.

283
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,960
No big deal.

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,280
Every time you make a dish, you write your name on it and catch up.

285
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,680
Jacob's...

286
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
You make some...

287
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,880
You make some omurice.

288
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,000
You want some omurice shit?

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Oh, Justin, I'm so happy that you're watching Terrace House.

290
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
It fulfills me in a spiritual way.

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,880
You write Phil's food pics,

292
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
and I'm assuming food is pH just to keep...

293
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
Or Phil is with an F.

294
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
It's your call.

295
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
And actually, pics is also pH but pronounced differently.

296
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah, with three X's,

297
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
and you just write Phil's food pics and catch up on every one,

298
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
so they'll never be able to take that from you.

299
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
Can we all agree that if you post a food picture,

300
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,680
you're actually only doing that for yourself?

301
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
You don't actually think anyone else in the world

302
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,400
is going to look at the food you ate and appreciate it.

303
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
It's so like in a year, you can look back and be like,

304
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,080
damn, that was a good sandwich.

305
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,720
It's savage.

306
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,960
No, it's savagery because the only response...

307
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,800
Sometimes I'll post pics of Blue Apron meals

308
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,640
that come out especially picturesque,

309
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,800
and the only response I ever get is like,

310
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
ah, fuck, I'm so hungry.

311
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,360
It's like, oh, no, because that will only...

312
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
I didn't mean to make you hungry.

313
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
I was just sharing this great food pic.

315
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,640
I like seeing it though.

316
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,760
I like seeing it.

317
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,080
I have certain friends on Instagram and co-workers

318
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,480
that they live in New York,

319
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
and so they're eating good food all the time,

320
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
and I just follow them on Instagram because it's like,

321
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
whoa, I didn't even know Robin could do that.

322
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
That looks good as hell.

323
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Well done.

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
I think of those people in my mind that I don't know very well,

325
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,800
but I follow them on Instagram,

326
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
and all they post is good food pics.

327
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm like, that's a cool person

328
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
because they eat good food all the time.

329
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,240
They are living very, very right.

330
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
Do you know who has the best at that?

331
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
You know who's the best at that?

332
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
Who?

333
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
Mr. Aziz Ansari.

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Oh, yeah.

335
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
Well, yeah, he's living the dream.

336
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
He's always eating.

337
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,480
Food pics are on point.

338
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
They're very good stuff.

339
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
But how do I stop people on Facebook

340
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
from taking credit of my food pics is the real question

341
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
because I'll be honest, we've all done it.

342
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
I saw my friend Susan put up a pic of ribs,

343
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
and I was like, my ribs.

344
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
You're going to need like a micro dot,

345
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
like something hidden within the photo

346
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,640
that if you zoom in 12 times proves that it was yours,

347
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,880
and then that's your secret watermark

348
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,640
that they'll never know to remove.

349
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,560
Or you hide something embarrassing in the background.

350
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
If you know your friend,

351
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
Jerrica is going to steal it,

352
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,400
is going to steal your food pics,

353
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,920
and she's done it before,

354
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
I made a watercress salad,

355
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
and she stole it and she said,

356
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,040
this is Jerrica's watercress salad.

357
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,400
Then you put up a pic, a food pic,

358
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
and it's like, here's some turkey burgers I made,

359
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,760
and they turned out really great.

360
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
Jerrica's like, my turkey burgers.

361
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
You delete your picture,

362
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,200
and then you comment on Jerrica's picture and say like,

363
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
what's that in the background?

364
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,120
It's a little turd.

365
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,400
Nice.

366
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,480
You hid a little turd in the background of the picture,

367
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,760
and she didn't see it.

368
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,080
She didn't do it.

369
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,120
Oh, but then her shit goes viral quite literally.

370
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,760
Yeah.

371
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,560
She becomes famous, but she becomes famous?

372
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
Well, I don't want her to become,

373
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,880
no, I'm just trying to teach her like a lesson about stealing.

374
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Everyone hates her,

375
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
and you've ruined Jerrica's life.

376
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,920
No, I don't want to do that.

377
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,560
I don't want to do that.

378
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
You did, Griffin.

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
Her life is ruined.

380
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
She can't get a job now.

381
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
Can't you just call out the exif data?

382
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
Just like, I'm checking the location stamp on this photo,

383
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,800
and oh, that's weird.

384
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
It was taken at my Aunt Jackie's house.

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
I didn't realize that you guys were so close together.

386
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,840
That's so weird.

387
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,720
Unfortunately, Justin, the problem is that that can be faked.

388
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
You actually have to take the picture before you post it,

389
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
print it out, mail it to yourself.

390
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
Don't open the envelope.

391
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,000
But once you receive the envelope, don't open it.

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Then you can post it.

393
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,960
And that, I think that works in any court of law.

394
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,200
You know that legally, that doesn't work.

395
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,560
It doesn't hold up in court,

396
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,720
unless you write the jig is up on the envelope.

397
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Because that way, imagine like you post a food pic that you stole,

398
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,640
and then you get an envelope in the mail.

399
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,920
It just says the jig is up.

400
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,720
Or like you're in a court, and the judge is like,

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
anybody have any evidence?

402
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,360
And then you stand up in the back of the court,

403
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
and you just have this huge envelope that says the jig is up.

404
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Well, hold on, Justin.

405
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm gonna give a little bit of change there.

406
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,840
You have addressed the envelope to the court, to the judge.

407
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,520
Yeah, and it gets delivered, hand delivered by someone running in,

408
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,600
going, wait, hold on, before you rule,

409
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I do have this letter for you, judge.

410
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,240
P.O. Box Court, C.O. Judge, the jig is up, colon, evidence.

411
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,360
New, new shocking evidence is important.

412
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,760
You write new shocking evidence on there,

413
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,600
because you got to entice him into opening it.

414
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,640
If it looks boring, the judge probably won't even check it out.

415
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,800
Don't put that or resident shit on there,

416
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,480
or that judge will never open it.

417
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,120
Love, love Reggie.

418
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,320
Why does it say, why did you put love Reggie on the envelope?

419
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,960
When you open it, it's just full of like glitter,

420
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
but also the picture of your food.

421
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
Why does it say on the back, why does it say me undies?

422
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
Well, I reuse the envelope.

423
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
Okay, it's resealable.

424
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know what you want from me.

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Why did they make me undies?

426
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
Why is it resealable?

427
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
I'm not gonna put my underpants back in there.

428
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
Me undies, I love you.

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
You know this, I'm wearing you now,

430
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
and you are literally all I own in the underwear game.

431
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,000
You've got your underwear game so strong.

432
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,120
Why does the package that you come in reseal?

433
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm gonna need that one again.

434
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
I don't think I'm gonna, no, no.

435
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,320
No, I'm gonna put you in the boo-boo box.

436
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,400
Here's another question.

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
I just recently moved into an apartment

438
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
with four other girls.

439
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,560
While I was putting my kitchen things away on move-in day,

440
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,520
I noticed that one of my roommates

441
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,560
has a ridiculous amount of Cheers themed dishware,

442
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,200
as in they all have the Cheers TV show logo on them.

443
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm not even joking.

444
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
There are so many cheers and blazing cups, plates, and bowls

445
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
that they're taking over all of our cabinets.

446
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
How can I tell my roommate I'd rather not have,

447
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,640
I'd rather have some more conservative dishware

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
than a full tribute to Frasier Crane?

449
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
Cheerful in Columbus is who this is from,

450
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,800
but I'm gonna say Adufus.

451
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
This is from Adufus.

452
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Because I would be so happy every single day of my life

453
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
if everybody knew my cups,

454
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,920
because they knew that I had Cheers memorabilia.

455
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,160
There is no TV show that I would find

456
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,680
this an unacceptable arrangement for.

457
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,880
All my plates and cups have Boston Legal logos on it.

458
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,440
Never seen a fucking episode of it.

459
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
Oh, I was gonna say Boston Commons.

460
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh, shit.

461
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
All of them, Rescue 911.

462
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
Never seen the program.

463
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,840
I haven't seen the program, but come on over.

464
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,480
I've got a story to tell.

465
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,040
It's amazing.

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm so jealous.

467
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
How fantastic.

468
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
That is fantastic.

469
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Okay, here's my theory as to what has happened here.

470
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,280
This person, they went to, let's say Goodwill,

471
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,160
and they saw like a Cheers mug

472
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
or like a set of four Cheers glasses,

473
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,560
and they thought that was ironic

474
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,520
to have those in their barware set.

475
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,560
They had those at home.

476
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Then grandma came over and visited.

477
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,640
They gave them a glass, right, of water in the Cheers cup.

478
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Grandma goes, oh, they like Cheers.

479
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:46,960
Cheers.

480
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
You're a norm head too, huh?

481
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
And then that's all they're getting

482
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
for like the next eight Christmases.

483
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
It's all Cheers memorabilia.

484
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
I just had a great realization.

485
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,800
Now that the information about our TV show is public,

486
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
we can tell this slam dunk Cheers story.

487
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,840
Hell yeah.

488
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,960
So we're in Boston.

489
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,560
This isn't a great, I don't, it's a fun story for us.

490
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
I wouldn't call it a slam dunk story.

491
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Well, you haven't even heard me tell it.

492
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Oh, you're right.

493
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,600
I found the drama in it, and I can twist it anyway.

494
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
So we're staying at the hotel

495
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,120
and we're looking for places to go nearby,

496
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,960
and our showrunner, JD Amato, took a train in six hours

497
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
to come to us in Boston to talk to us about the TV show

498
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,800
because we're gonna like have a meeting

499
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
about what we want this TV show to be like.

500
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,800
So JD shows up and he's like, guys, where are we going?

501
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,520
He's from New York.

502
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
He doesn't know the cool places.

503
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
And Travis is like, I got a place.

504
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,800
So we start walking a lot and it is beyond sweltering.

505
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,400
I mean, it is over 100 degrees, absolutely miserable.

506
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
And we've walked maybe six blocks before Travis reveals to us

507
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,040
that we're going to Cheers.

508
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,120
We walk another 20 minutes conservatively

509
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,160
and we cannot find the place

510
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,720
and we're just kind of wandering for a little while.

511
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,200
And JD says, boy, I hope that you guys really like Cheers

512
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
to make this worth it.

513
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
And Travis reveals that he has not actually ever watched Cheers,

514
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,800
which Griffin echoes and then I double echo.

515
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, I missed Cheers.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,160
Actually, none of us have watched Cheers.

517
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,360
And he was very, very disappointed at us.

518
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,480
Fast forward to us actually finding Cheers

519
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,680
and we go downstairs and it was too crowded.

520
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,360
So we stole a pin and left and ate at a pizza place.

521
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,520
They said it's a 100 hour wait.

522
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,800
And I said, what's my name?

523
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,080
And they said, I don't know.

524
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,680
And I said, fuck you, bye.

525
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
But we did get our picture in front of Cheers.

526
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
They do have a person there that takes your name

527
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,560
to put in your reservation.

528
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,280
That must be the worst job on planet Earth.

529
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
You are hearing this name, please.

530
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't you know it already?

531
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
Like every, like literally 20 times a day.

532
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
That's that person's entire existence.

533
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,760
That's worse.

534
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
I'd rather clean the shitters at Cheers

535
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,880
than be the person who greets people there.

536
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,760
I don't know, Justin.

537
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,440
There, someone every day is just destroying the shitters.

538
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,760
This place is an iconic TV landmark.

539
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,320
I've been saving up my dumb skis all week.

540
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,080
You never think that when people yell norm,

541
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
it may be a warning that he's about to go in there

542
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,040
and just strip my in the potty in a really savage way.

543
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,400
He's had a long work day and he's just gonna,

544
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
he's just gonna have a terrible,

545
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
terrible episode in there every day.

546
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm gonna go to this later this year.

547
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
Me and my wife are taking a trip to Seattle.

548
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm gonna shoot a Duke in the Grey's Anatomy Hospital.

549
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,000
Fuck yeah.

550
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,240
I've been, I shot Dukes in major landmarks

551
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,560
in all 50 of these American states.

552
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,880
I couldn't get in the San Francisco house

553
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,560
from fucking full house, but I sure did it in the backyard.

554
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,680
Hey, you know the-

555
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,560
Me and Comet both shit in the backyard.

556
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,120
You know the Comet bathroom in Ally McBeal?

557
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
Yep, dumped in it.

558
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Dumped there.

559
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Name a bathroom in a TV show.

560
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,040
I'll tell you if I dumped there.

561
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,280
I dumped in John Adams High.

562
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
I dumped at Bayside.

563
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
I dumped, I dumped in two Tardises.

564
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,520
Two of them.

565
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Two of them.

566
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Fucking fucking Capaldi.

567
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
Best day of my life, dumped in doctor number two's Tardis.

568
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,680
It was great.

569
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,040
It felt real good.

570
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,760
Carolyn was in the city, but Devon was in the shitter

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,880
and he had his way.

572
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Hey, I was inside Veronica's closet.

573
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
I took a dump in it.

574
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
I left a major Torgleson in that bathroom.

575
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
Torgleson all over that one.

576
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
Growing pains.

577
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,800
I hear you, my man.

578
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,960
I had some of my own in there.

579
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
Or like going pains, because I ate a lot of roughage.

580
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,480
This is my new favorite character.

581
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
Hey, guys, good news, the Patty Duke show writes itself.

582
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
I left a dirty little liar lying right on the floor.

583
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,800
Dear Matt Greening, I have a weird request for you.

584
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
I need you to draw me.

585
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
I need this, please.

586
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Please.

587
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
This is my white whale.

588
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Oh, shit.

589
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,360
Another Yahoo?

590
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes, please.

591
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,000
Do you think the third Rock from the Sun toilet flush is weird?

592
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
Like all space and aliens and stuff?

593
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh, hell yeah, dude, that show fucking is so funny.

594
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,520
Here's a good Yahoo and it was sent in by Morgan Davey.

595
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,480
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

596
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,760
Thank you, it's Yahoo Answers user.

597
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,120
Wonder Bob asks, I need to fake like I've smoked pot before.

598
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,360
Here's the sitch.

599
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm going to hang out with my friend tomorrow.

600
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
He's a bit of a stoner.

601
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,680
He's under the impression that I'm a regular smoker of pot.

602
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,280
I am not, but in all likelihood, I will smoke pot at his house tomorrow.

603
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,760
So I need to be able to act like I do it regularly.

604
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,320
Help.

605
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
First of all, I'm glad you came to us.

606
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
Don't weed.

607
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,920
Weed is not for mead is what they tell you to say.

608
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
How do you pretend like, oh, this good thing?

609
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,120
Oh, this stuff?

610
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,760
Oh, thanks.

611
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
How do I start it?

612
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Just kidding.

613
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,280
I know how to start it.

614
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,480
You know what the thing is about that?

615
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,600
The best thing about this is that when it comes to weed, as it's been explained to me

616
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
by many young people, because I wouldn't know.

617
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
Yeah, like from comedy movies.

618
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,000
Like comedy movies and such and, you know, pamphlets I've read.

619
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,560
It's that there are so many different, I believe it's called strains, different varieties,

620
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,000
and different ways that people smoke them that like, all you have to say is like,

621
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
oh, how do you do it?

622
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,160
Oh, that's not what I learned.

623
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
I rub it on my fucking eyes.

624
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,400
I put a stick on the end and rub it back and forth real fast, like on Survivor,

625
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
when they're trying to start a fire.

626
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
That's how I kind of get it going.

627
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,560
Is that not what you do?

628
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,480
In those scenes where they smoke weed on Survivor.

629
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,800
The fact of the matter is everybody's self-conscious about how they smoke weed.

630
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,360
Everybody.

631
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,080
Even like the person who's done it a bajillion times.

632
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
I think that you're probably wild.

633
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
I think that may be the dumbest thing you've ever said.

634
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,240
You don't think that everyone, you don't think that everyone who has ever smoked weed

635
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,800
is constantly looking for a better way to do it?

636
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,240
YouTube.com.

637
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,440
Going right now.

638
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,560
You're coming with me, Travis.

639
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
Cool weed tricks.

640
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Okay, let me rephrase.

641
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
98% of the people who smoke weed are constantly-

642
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,040
66,500 people are saying, check out my good stuff.

643
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
Okay, 66,500 people.

644
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,400
That can't be all the people using weed.

645
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
A lot of these are compilations, so inflate that number.

646
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,960
I have news for you, Travis.

647
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,760
If people who are smoking weed are regularly spending that time worrying about how they're

648
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,480
smoking it, they're smoking very bad marijuana and they should probably get some different

649
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,200
ones because as far as I understand, you're smoking weed to do exactly the opposite of

650
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
what you're describing.

651
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,440
Yes, Justin, because no one's ever smoked weed and then gotten nervous.

652
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,640
Come on.

653
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm not saying I'm not saying nervous.

654
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,280
I'm saying that like what you said is a ludicrous thing that like people like people who smoke

655
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,720
weed a lot are like, I know I could be doing this better anyway.

656
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,120
Well, like I said, I've never done it before because I'm a good, good boy.

657
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,360
Yeah.

658
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,880
And Nani, if you're listening, I've never-

659
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm afraid of this stuff.

660
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,600
Yeah, it's bad for me is what I've heard.

661
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
What if I die from using it?

662
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,440
I just assume that everyone must be trying to do it better or else why would they keep

663
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,840
doing it?

664
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
Doesn't- aren't they trying to master it?

665
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,400
Like, you know, like that 10,000 hours Malcolm Gladwell shit.

666
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,320
Everybody smokes weed to get better at it.

667
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,920
You guys also look at Malcolm Gladwell and just think like-

668
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh, he parties.

669
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
I bet he parties.

670
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,840
Oh, yeah.

671
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
He's an outlier, if you know what I mean.

672
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,920
I also like, it's a criminal crime.

673
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
What?

674
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
It's a criminal crime to do it.

675
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,800
Not everywhere.

676
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,520
Not for everybody.

677
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
I mean, it is for me, so it should be for everybody, but that's beside the point.

678
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,600
But like, I don't go around and like take other people's cars and like have- now I have that

679
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,000
one.

680
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,240
Now I have this Pontiac Grand Prix.

681
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040
You know what I mean?

682
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,560
Like, I don't walk into Burger King and take all the food in there without paying for it.

683
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,720
I guess that makes sense.

684
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,440
Although, from what I understand, if I did have one of those goobies, then I probably

685
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,280
would go to Burger King and eat all the food there because of- I guess you get super hungry?

686
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,920
Yeah, and then you steal a car to get to Burger King because you're so hungry from smoking

687
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,880
the gooby.

688
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
Yeah, and I don't want to crash my car because I'm all goobed out.

689
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,800
Hold on, there's somebody at the door.

690
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,840
Oh, just- are you sure?

691
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
Just read it on- okay.

692
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,320
Guys, I've just gotten an official note from the president and it says that we're all

693
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,120
dads now and it's actually legally been- it says here, legally been too long since you

694
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,120
smoked weed to be able to joke about it on your podcast and have anything that approaches

695
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,960
relevance or comedy.

696
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,800
I mean, it's just- and it's got his stamp-

697
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
He stamped it.

698
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,720
I mistake.

699
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,560
It is from Joe Biden, which does- that tracks.

700
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,600
Oh, that makes sense.

701
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,080
That tracks.

702
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh, okay.

703
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,920
That tracks.

704
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,320
Because I was thinking like President Barack Hussein Obama, a lot of people forget the

705
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
Hussein support, that he's busy.

706
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,120
He's got a lot of stuff going on right now because he's like scrambling to like, what

707
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,600
can I do to like hold this thing together?

708
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
But Joe- Joe Bags.

709
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,080
Joey Bag of Donuts.

710
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,400
You know he's- I would expect this from him.

711
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
So no more- we can't do it anymore?

712
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
We can't do weed jokes anymore.

713
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,840
We actually can't do weed jokes.

714
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,560
He says if you smoke it again, the timer resets.

715
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,440
Oh, wait, hold on.

716
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,080
Sorry, hold on.

717
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
Oh, sorry, my door.

718
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
I got a letter from Joe Biden too.

719
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
Oh, shit.

720
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,400
That if we ever want to do another weed question again, we'll have to do an all high episode.

721
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,080
Oh, where we all get- okay.

722
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,920
I have a child though.

723
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,720
Listen, I do too.

724
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,760
Listen, I'm right there with you.

725
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,800
We're all on the same page.

726
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,520
I don't know.

727
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,080
This is just letting people know that maybe we need to take a weed joke break for a while.

728
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,320
Okay.

729
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
Yeah, we can't joke about weed anymore.

730
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,560
But in like- in like 2022-

731
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
When it's all people?

732
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,000
No, no, no.

733
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm saying like in 2022, my- my- my boy, my very special boy is going to be like, this

734
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
is for him now.

735
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,920
Henry, that was- daddy was joking.

736
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Daddy- daddy was joking.

737
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
It was never- it was never real.

738
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
It was all for jokes.

739
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,560
For the audience.

740
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,160
For fun.

741
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,960
For daddy's job.

742
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
Daddy's just having fun.

743
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,080
Daddy's just having fun with his friends, hon.

744
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,680
Honey.

745
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,960
Go back and watch some more, uh, Barney 2.

746
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
The sequel to Barney.

747
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,120
The raunchy, edgy sequel of Barney.

748
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,040
The fucking gritty remake of Barney that we have in the future.

749
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,200
This is- this is my brother, Barno.

750
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
I've got a gun.

751
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,640
What?

752
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Barno, no.

753
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
What?

754
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,120
Build the wall.

755
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,920
What?

756
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,400
Barney?

757
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,240
You shouldn't have a gun.

758
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
No, it's cool if you know how to use it.

759
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,280
Barno?

760
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm telling you, man.

761
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,840
Dig these- dig these crazy guns.

762
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,920
Pry it out of my toughy purple talons.

763
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
Uh, let's go to the money zone.

764
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,680
Oh, wait.

765
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,840
I have somebody at my door.

766
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,640
God almighty.

767
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,600
Some Thai food I ordered earlier.

768
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Well, if you want to pay for it, we're going to need to go to the money zone.

769
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Our first sponsor this week is Trunk Club.

770
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Travis, you always do such a good job talking about Trunk Club.

771
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
Can you- can you repeat the magic?

772
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,520
Oh, do you mean tell about the best pants I've ever owned in my entire life?

773
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,160
That's the one.

774
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,360
Here's the thing.

775
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,560
Let me tell you a little story.

776
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,480
No, it's not a story.

777
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,040
That's not true.

778
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,600
The story is like a thing that happened, but this is more observations than anything else.

779
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,200
If you're like me, then you're the type of person who looks at clothes and thinks,

780
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,960
how the hell am I supposed to know what clothes are worth it?

781
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,240
Because yeah, there's options where I could pay like $100 for a shirt,

782
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
but that just seems like I'm flushing my money away.

783
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
I don't know anything about shirts.

784
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,120
Let me tell you something.

785
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,040
I bought some pants from Trunk Club and they are, without a doubt,

786
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,800
no joke, no exaggeration, no smoke, the best pants I've ever owned in my life.

787
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,240
How many pockets- how many pockets they got?

788
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,920
A billion.

789
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,000
No, like a normal amount, like five pockets.

790
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,520
Interesting.

791
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,520
But the thing is, is the material, the way they fit, the way they look,

792
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,640
these are what adult jeans are.

793
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,680
This is adult jeans.

794
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm wearing adult- these are adult jeans, Griffin.

795
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,280
These aren't my little boy jeans anymore.

796
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,040
I still like my boy jeans though.

797
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,080
They make me feel like I can go out in the yard and play around

798
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
and I don't even worry about it.

799
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,840
But boy jeans aren't an everyday jean, Griffin.

800
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,240
Sometimes you have to go to like, I don't know, the store and you want to look like an adult

801
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
and not have people like tell you where the candy aisle is.

802
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,160
That's actually a great service that they can provide for me.

803
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,400
Thank you.

804
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,320
Sometimes that is actually a nice thing.

805
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,160
My boy jeans have special candy pockets,

806
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,800
so this is actually a perfect arrangement, what you just described.

807
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,880
You know what, market for a pick-a-mix.

808
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,000
What you should do-

809
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,240
What you got to do then is you got to go to Trunk Club

810
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,520
and you need to talk to your personal stylist at Trunk Club and say,

811
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm looking for a jean I can wear to the candy aisle of the grocery store

812
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,520
and I guarantee you they will give you that perfect jean.

813
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,440
Maybe it's got lollies already stuck to it.

814
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,680
And they have-

815
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,440
Some people know you're a sugar head.

816
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,800
And big cargo pockets for putting all of your bridge mix.

817
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,040
Yeah.

818
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,200
Hey, Travis, I love you.

819
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,640
That's theft, my dude.

820
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,120
No, no, no.

821
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,240
Once you buy it, Justin, then you just eat out of the pockets all day.

822
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,600
Okay.

823
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,440
Those are your all day snack pants.

824
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, these are my candy pants.

825
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
So here's what you're going to do.

826
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
You're going to go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

827
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,200
You're going to type in your measurements.

828
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,280
You're going to share your likes, dislikes,

829
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,840
and talk about the things that you need to close for.

830
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,960
And Trunk Club is going to send you a trunk of clothing straight to your door.

831
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,680
It's going to be handpicked by your very own personal stylist

832
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,600
and you keep what you like and you send back what you don't

833
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
and you only pay for what you keep.

834
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,320
It's a great deal and they're going to send you amazing stuff.

835
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,880
I've done it.

836
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,680
Justin's done it.

837
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,800
And you end up with amazing clothes that enter the rotation

838
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,560
and it's your favorite stuff.

839
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
And the best thing is it's not a subscription service.

840
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,080
It's not something that you have to worry about being charged for every month.

841
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,000
You only pay for it when you do it and you only do it when you need it.

842
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,080
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and check it out.

843
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,920
And if you're in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, DC, or Charleston, South Carolina,

844
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,080
you can go into one of their clubhouses and work with the stylist right there in person.

845
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,200
Try on the clothes right there and have a very special clothing experience.

846
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,480
Yeah, so go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and get on board.

847
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
I want to tell you about Warby Parker.

848
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,520
We are also sponsored in part this week by Warby Parker.

849
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,280
It's a new concept in eyewear. You've probably heard of what they do.

850
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,120
It's the best, it's just the best way to buy fashion forward, affordable glasses.

851
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,480
You go online, you pick out, you pick out five pairs of glasses

852
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,200
and they ship these frames to your home as part of the home try on program.

853
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
These prescription glasses start at 95 bucks, including lenses,

854
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
and you can get both glasses and sunglasses.

855
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
So they send you five frames.

856
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
You put them on, you see what works, see what doesn't.

857
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,800
And then you get to keep the ones that you like.

858
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
And it's really fast.

859
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
It's, you get a prepaid package.

860
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,240
It's easy to ship back to the ones that you don't want.

861
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,840
And they have really slick looking sunglasses.

862
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,240
Not only that, for every pair of sunglasses that are sold,

863
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
they distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

864
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
So it's a really, it's a really cool company.

865
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,720
And again, you can get UV protected sunglasses starting at 95 bucks,

866
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,640
or you can get those sunglasses with a prescription for 175 bucks

867
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,120
as the minimum price there.

868
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,600

Justin, did you laugh in the middle of that

877
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,800
because you read on to our Jumbotrons?

878
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,600
No, I don't ever read ahead.

879
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,760
I just take it as it comes, you know?

880
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,400
Okay.

881
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,600
Play it as it lies.

882
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,160
Because I was reading them and appreciating them immensely.

883
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,240
First off, I just want to say all, we put Jumbotrons for 2017

884
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,200
for my brother, my brother and me on sale.

885
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,080
And they all sold out, I think the first day.

886
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,840
So you're all incredible.

887
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,040
Yeah, they're all sold out.

888
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,240
So like, thank you so much for that.

889
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
That's fantastic.

890
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,080
So we don't deserve you as always.

891
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
No new information there.

892
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,680
This first message is for 30-year-old Lizzie

893
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
and it's from 29-year-old Lizzie.

894
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,880
So dope.

895
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
It says, hey, Lizzie, it's me, past Lizzie.

896
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I know you're 30 and you're mourning the slow

897
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
and honorable loss of youth, but it's okay.

898
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,520
You're still kind of young.

899
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,240
If you're a hobbit, you wouldn't have even come of age yet.

900
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,520
In your 30th year, you'll graduate, get married.

901
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,080
You'll up your max fund donation.

902
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,960
Thank you.

903
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,800
And you'll continue to be kick-ass.

904
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,160
PS, I hate you, Ron.

905
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,360
And congratulations to 30-year-old Lizzie.

906
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,400
She's been kicking it that way since the first

907
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,120
or second week of August, which is a little suspect

908
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,240
if that's your birthday, Lizzie.

909
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
I think you probably know when that falls.

910
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,360
You could probably zero in.

911
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,840
You could probably zero in a little bit more specifically, Liz.

912
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,440
But maybe in the year 30, you'll be a little bit more punctual

913
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
and you'll finally lock down when your birthday is.

914
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,520
But happy birthday to you, Lizzie.

915
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
Oh, you're going to do this next one?

916
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,480
Well, you guys did both of the ads.

917
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,080
Hell yeah, dude, let her rip.

918
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,400
Yeah.

919
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Here it comes.

920
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,040
I got a message for Dan Craig and it's from Kat Comfort.

921
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
And the message is this.

922
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Dan O, super sorry I didn't stop in Chicago

923
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,760
that last time I drove through Illinois.

924
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,560
I was like right there and I just kept on trucking.

925
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,120
My bad.

926
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,320
But for realsies, thanks for being my very great pal

927
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,600
for almost 20 years.

928
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
Love, Katrinka.

929
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,280
And that is very-

930
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,160
I get it.

931
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,480
You don't want to fuck with the Dan Ryan Expressway.

932
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,080
You're trucking through Illinois.

933
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,600
You're like, I'm going to make a pit stop in Chicago.

934
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,480
That's a 14-hour trip with all the traffic on I-94.

935
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,600
No thanks, I say.

936
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
No, thank you.

937
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,480
I mean, I'll go, I want a chili dog as much as the next guy.

938
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,080
I'd love to get some of that deep dish,

939
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,160
but no way, it's not worth it.

940
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,120
They should have a deep dish place on the highway

941
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,240
that you could just drive through.

942
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,560
You should be able to roll your fucking window down

943
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,000
on the Dan Ryan Expressway

944
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,360
and they just launch one right through

945
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,440
the old fucking passenger side.

946
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm Brian.

947
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,800
And I'm Erin.

948
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
And we host Throwing Shade,

949
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,920
a political comedy podcast that's somehow horribly offensive

950
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
and socially conscious.

951
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,880
If you want to know what it sounds like

952
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
if the news drinks straight vodka,

953
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,720
check us out on Thursdays on MaxFun.

954
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,080
And we're the first MaxFun podcast to be turned into a TV show,

955
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,440
so check that out January 17th on TV Land.

956
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,080
Throwing Shade.

957
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,520
Politics.

958
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,560
Pop culture.

959
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,360
Wigs for days.

960
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,680
Do you guys want to, or did we just do a Yahoo?

961
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
I think it's time for a regular question.

962
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,520
Yeah.

963
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,400
Yeah, regular question.

964
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,960
Here it come.

965
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
Badging past security today,

966
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
a security guard old lady commented,

967
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,840
you always look sad.

968
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,560
I had no response to this.

969
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,400
I just shook my head and kept going.

970
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,320
I'm not entirely sure I've ever been,

971
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,360
seen this person before.

972
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,000
Was there a better way I should have handled this?

973
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,320
That's for just trying to get to my workplace in Tucson.

974
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, man.

975
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,360
The best way is just you're going,

976
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll have your job and keep walking.

977
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
I have seen trailers.

978
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,800
Have you guys seen these trailers

979
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,480
for, I think it's a Will Smith movie

980
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,240
and he gets visited by these ghosts,

981
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
but one of them's like death

982
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,800
and one of them is like love,

983
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,320
one of them is like God or whatever.

984
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,000
But one of them is in,

985
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,200
I think it's called like collateral happiness

986
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
or something like that.

987
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
Some accidental joy.

988
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,200
Maybe it's one of those situations

989
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,600
where it's just sort of like an avatar

990
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,120
of like a particular virtue or God or something like that.

991
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,280
And it's just like, buck up.

992
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,680
I actually, I'm going to take your example

993
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,960
one step further, Griffin,

994
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,080
and say that this person is that classic example

995
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,320
of like in a movie preview

996
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
where they have that one line

997
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
that kind of conveys to the audience

998
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,280
everything they need to know about that character.

999
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,520
Where it's just like, you're always so stressed.

1000
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
When are you going to take time for you?

1001
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,240
Yeah, that's a good point, Jeff.

1002
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
Was this like exposition?

1003
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,600
Were you in the middle of exposition

1004
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
about your character for a movie

1005
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,640
that's being filmed about you in secret?

1006
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I watched While You Were Sleeping last night,

1007
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,880
and I'm pretty sure this person was in the movie.

1008
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,680
Wait, hold on.

1009
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
Did you just do that ironically

1010
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,360
because you were not sleeping because of the baby?

1011
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,860
No.

1012
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,080
Yeah, I just wanted to watch something

1013
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,520
with sleeping in the title.

1014
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Just to remember what it was like when you were sleeping.

1015
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
I watched that movie.

1016
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,520
Sleepless in Seattle?

1017
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,080
No, thank you.

1018
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,440
Got a belly full of sleep.

1019
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
Got a belly full of that.

1020
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,520
I would rather watch Peter Gallagher in a fucking coma.

1021
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,280
Push me on the train tracks, my love.

1022
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,360
Please.

1023
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,080
Wait, hold on.

1024
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,120
I don't think Sandra Bullock pushes Peter Gallagher

1025
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,520
onto the train tracks so she can pretend to be.

1026
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,200
I haven't seen it in a while,

1027
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
but I don't think she does it and goes, this will do it.

1028
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,360
You're probably one of the few people

1029
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,640
that ever watched that film

1030
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,680
and eye Peter Gallagher enviously in his coma bed.

1031
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,440
Like, oh God, that would be such a choice.

1032
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,000
So dope.

1033
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,960
Real nice.

1034
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
Just snoozing whatever you want, huh?

1035
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,320
Because he wakes up and he wakes up

1036
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,480
and Sandra Bullock's his fiancee.

1037
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,880
And in the movie, he's like, I don't know this.

1038
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
I don't remember any of this happening.

1039
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,400
I don't remember this being my life.

1040
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,320
But it's like, Peter Gallagher,

1041
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,480
you just got like a bunch of sleep

1042
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,840
and you woke up and you're married to Sandy.

1043
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,640
Good flick, though.

1044
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,440
Good flick, though.

1045
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,640
Peter Gallagher.

1046
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,280
She doesn't...

1047
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
We're supposed to be fucking rooting for Bill Pullman.

1048
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,520
What an A-level cast.

1049
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
No, thanks.

1050
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,400
Oh, she ended up with Bill Pullman.

1051
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,040
Everything's okay.

1052
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,800
She could have had Pete Gallagher.

1053
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,280
And she-

1054
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,080
No, okay, listen.

1055
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,600
But she didn't, Griffin.

1056
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,680
She didn't know Pete Gallagher.

1057
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,360
She got to know Bill Pullman.

1058
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,240
That's the whole point.

1059
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
She had this whole made up fantasy.

1060
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
She knew he had one nut.

1061
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,560
What else do you need?

1062
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,120
I haven't seen that movie in so long.

1063
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Yeah, it gets wild.

1064
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,240
She pushes a man onto a fucking train track.

1065
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,160
She doesn't push him, Griffin.

1066
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,640
Yeah.

1067
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,720
And there's a few story beats that involve his nut.

1068
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,560
His one nut.

1069
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,240
His one nut actually resolves a conflict in the first act.

1070
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,080
This is not a joke.

1071
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,480
What was the question?

1072
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,400
Yeah, exactly.

1073
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,920
The old lady said you always look sad.

1074
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,800
Yeah, this stinks.

1075
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,120
I don't think this is a good thing to say to anybody.

1076
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,800
Hey, you always look sad.

1077
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Cool.

1078
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
I don't know what to do with that information.

1079
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,080
This falls under the same, like,

1080
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,480
if anyone ever says to another human being,

1081
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
like, you should smile more.

1082
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,200
Like, this kind of, like,

1083
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,320
we all just need to stop commenting on the facial expressions made by other people.

1084
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,120
Because for all you know, that person is just really contemplative.

1085
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,080
Like, all the time.

1086
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,120
But also, more importantly, fuck you.

1087
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,480
Yeah, also that.

1088
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Like, you don't get to dictate how anyone else should look, ever.

1089
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
That idea of, like, if I want to frown all the time,

1090
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,320
and, like, that's my deal.

1091
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,520
Like, go fuck yourself.

1092
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,480
Unless.

1093
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,760
Unless.

1094
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,800
The person's got touched by an angel.

1095
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Oh, we're in a Roma Downey situation.

1096
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,560
You've never seen this security guard before.

1097
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
So either it's her first day,

1098
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,720
and you said she's an old, what, old lady.

1099
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,240
And if we take that, like, this is like an 85 year old woman.

1100
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,880
Angel.

1101
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,520
Angel, right?

1102
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,040
She's not starting a new career in security guard.

1103
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,600
You know what I mean?

1104
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,680
Like, put the fucking clues together.

1105
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,320
You gotta, if you want to, if you want to spot an angel,

1106
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,920
you gotta, you gotta follow the clues.

1107
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,880
Because they're wily.

1108
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,000
So all old people are angels.

1109
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
No, I'm saying, yes.

1110
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,120
If you see an old person and they're not at church,

1111
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,640
then they're, then they're probably an angel, ironically.

1112
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,520
You know, and while you were sleeping, there's a,

1113
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
there's another story beat where there is a,

1114
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,360
she gets into Peter Gallagher's nice apartment,

1115
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,840
and the doorman is an old man.

1116
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,520
And he's like, I don't know, I don't know you.

1117
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,400
Get the fuck out of here.

1118
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,560
And first of all, it's like, don't be mean to Sandra Bullock.

1119
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,440
But he, she's like, oh, I'm Peter Gallagher's fiancee.

1120
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,840
And the doorman is like, oh, sorry, I'm new.

1121
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,640
So like, now I'm starting to put the clues together.

1122
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,040
This is another old person starting a new career

1123
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,960
in the security industry.

1124
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,760
I'm thinking that the, I'm thinking we got to fucking email

1125
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,840
Stranger Than Fiction style from characters in the movies

1126
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,120
while you were sleeping.

1127
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,240
You think that we're getting emailed by the characters

1128
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,280
in the movie?

1129
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,720
Well, of all the podcasts, if you're gonna email one podcast,

1130
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,040
I definitely would go to ours if I was a character

1131
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,400
while you were sleeping.

1132
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,840
I would email our podcast.

1133
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:18,240
I really like Sleepy Griffin a lot.

1134
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,320
They're just scrolling through the iTunes charts.

1135
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,680
They go way past the 20s and they duck into the 30s

1136
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,600
and they're like, I think I found my one.

1137
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,280
They're like, what's Chris Hardwick?

1138
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,600
No, no, no.

1139
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
He's way too popular.

1140
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,680
No, no.

1141
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,440
Who are these assholes?

1142
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
My brother, my brother and me, you say.

1143
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,920
They'll free me from the celluloid prison.

1144
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,000
The description of their show sounds like the rabblings

1145
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,880
of a madman.

1146
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,520
I think I'm gonna just go ahead and email these brothers

1147
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,640
I've never heard of before.

1148
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,400
That's like a message.

1149
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,440
You would have better luck writing a note to Marc Maron

1150
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,600
and throwing it into the ocean of getting your message out there.

1151
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,280
It's such a random play.

1152
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,400
Listen, Peter Boyle, we lost him 10 years ago.

1153
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,000
His ghost is inside of While You Were Sleeping

1154
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,680
and it listens to podcasts and he's a big fan

1155
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,200
and he sent me an email last night.

1156
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,480
Read between the lines, Justin.

1157
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,520
Read between the fucking lines, Justin.

1158
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,920
So I think we all know that that's the situation.

1159
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,240
Let's move on to a good Yahoo.

1160
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,000
Or should we just do another question?

1161
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,360
We got a fucking good question.

1162
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,320
So many questions.

1163
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,120
Hey, brothers three.

1164
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,560
I went to a restaurant with my family today

1165
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,040
but didn't order anything because I was very hungry.

1166
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,720
The waiter seemed very concerned with this.

1167
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,200
He kept asking if I was sure if I wanted to keep my menu

1168
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,720
and order later and whatnot.

1169
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,320
I said, no, I'm fine with just water.

1170
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,520
As he checked up on us or getting ready to leave,

1171
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,440
he offered me a ginger ale to go to help me feel better.

1172
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm not sick or anything, but I did accept the offer

1173
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,120
nodding and smiling as he wished for me to get better soon.

1174
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,840
Two questions.

1175
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,640
Am I good?

1176
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,320
And does my disheveled nature really look that pathetic?

1177
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,560
And that's from Pale and Mild in Portland, Maine.

1178
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,000
Okay, this is my shit.

1179
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,720
This is a perfect follow up to that last question

1180
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
because this person was like, are you okay?

1181
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,840
You look hung, you look sick.

1182
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,480
No, I'm fine.

1183
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,600
Are you sure you look sick?

1184
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,560
No, I'm telling you, I'm good.

1185
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,960
Okay, here's a thing I'm going to give you

1186
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,200
to fix this perceived problem.

1187
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
If this security guard had been like, you always look sad.

1188
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Here's a pack of Pokemon cards.

1189
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,920
That would be a fucking horse of a different color entirely.

1190
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,520
I'm going to sell it to you for half a sticker price.

1191
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
There might be like a holofoil in there.

1192
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,680
You don't fucking know.

1193
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,040
Gut check, gut check.

1194
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,800
How does this waiter's activities or waiter?

1195
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes, how do their activities treat you?

1196
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,960
Their decisions treat you?

1197
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,000
Because I think this is a nice little gesture.

1198
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,080
Well, there's, okay, I'll tell you this here,

1199
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,480
but it is either a nice little gesture

1200
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,520
or it is someone who sees a potential seat filler

1201
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,560
who's not spending money that they would get a tip from.

1202
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,320
Then why the ginger ale?

1203
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,880
Because they're trying to do something nice for the table

1204
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,480
to engender themselves with the table.

1205
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,200
So that people are like that waiter was so nice and conscientious

1206
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,920
and really cared about.

1207
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,200
I'm not saying that's bad.

1208
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
I'm saying this is a conscientious waiter

1209
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,520
who's trying to do right by the table.

1210
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,680
That's a really cynical way to look at this.

1211
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,600
Well, I've worked in a lot of restaurants.

1212
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I have to say this, in terms of, are you good?

1213
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,120
Someone offered you a ginger ale and you took it.

1214
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,920
Listen, I've been alive for 36 years.

1215
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,320
I cannot count any, I cannot summon any moments

1216
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,200
where someone had been like,

1217
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,320
hey, do you want a tall, frosty ginger ale to go?

1218
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,280
I would have said, no, I don't think I do want that.

1219
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,920
Because I'd use, yeah, pretty much all the time.

1220
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,120
If I had a cold ginger ale right now to just enjoy at my leisure,

1221
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
that would go down so good.

1222
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,640
Okay, but can we take a side note too?

1223
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,160
Because Justin, you're 100% right.

1224
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,680
I cannot remember a time in my life

1225
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,080
in which I thought I needed a ginger ale

1226
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,600
until someone offered it to me,

1227
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,320
be it a flight attendant or a waiter.

1228
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,840
And only then did I realize,

1229
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,720
yes, exactly what I need in this moment

1230
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
is a ginger ale.

1231
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,160
And you can never find it when you need it.

1232
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,480
If you want a ginger ale, there's not gonna be any around.

1233
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,000
So you just gotta take it when it comes.

1234
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
Unless it's a can of the dry.

1235
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,040
And then you say, thank you for the glass.

1236
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,720
And you pick it up and you walk to the bathroom

1237
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,320
and you pour it in the toilet.

1238
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,840
You pour it in the toilet or the urinal

1239
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,040
or the sink or the garbage can.

1240
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,160
Just like get rid of it.

1241
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,320
Is this that Austin snobbery I've been hearing about?

1242
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,720
The Austin ginger ale snobbery?

1243
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,200
No, it's just like that shit doesn't taste like ginger at all.

1244
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,040
Are you a Seagrams or nothing?

1245
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,000
Seagrams or Verner's is good shit.

1246
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Verner's is a little too sharp for me.

1247
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,120
I want it splicey.

1248
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,080
Give me that splice.

1249
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,560
It's a splice.

1250
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,680
A little too much splice for me.

1251
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,080
I want that.

1252
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,440
That ginger is a splice.

1253
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,720
Canada is the only one where I can find it in diet.

1254
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,600
And I'm drinking it every single night with Brandy.

1255
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,280
So I need diet.

1256
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,200
I don't need the extra K-Cals.

1257
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,680
I'm actually right now having a ginger beer

1258
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,040
and whiskey and bourbon.

1259
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,400
And ginger beer might be what I've been craving all these years,

1260
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,160
but I've been having a ginger ale,

1261
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,440
which now I say it out loud.

1262
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,160
Is a ginger ale a form of ginger beer?

1263
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,640
Discuss.

1264
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,440
Is there a ginger lager?

1265
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,160
No, this is bad.

1266
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,880
First of all, no.

1267
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,400
And second of all, I don't want to discuss.

1268
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,440
This is dead air.

1269
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,240
This is dead air.

1270
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
That angel is listening right now

1271
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,160
and she's just like, I've made a huge mistake.

1272
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,800
Peter Boyle is like, unsubscribe.

1273
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,600
I'm gonna go get a fucking deep dish pizza.

1274
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,080
I don't care if they read my shit or not.

1275
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,360
I hate this.

1276
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,360
Do you guys have another question?

1277
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,680
Peter Boyle's role in that movie, by the way,

1278
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,640
is I think he's like a grandpa of Peter Gallagher.

1279
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,280
And he fucking knows.

1280
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,840
Like he knows the secret that they're not really engaged.

1281
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,400
And he lets it go so far.

1282
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,960
They like are about to get married

1283
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,160
and Peter Boyle's like sitting there

1284
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,280
knowing this dark secret.

1285
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,200
It's like, say something, Peter.

1286
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,920
And he doesn't.

1287
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,400
Because he loves those young lovers, Griffin.

1288
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,360
He just likes seeing the young lovers.

1289
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,160
Oh, you tried to sneak it in there, huh?

1290
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,920
Young lovers getting married.

1291
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,160
I have a good Yahoo and I'd like to do it.

1292
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,280
Okay.

1293
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
It's from Nicholas Potter sent this one in.

1294
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,880
Thank you, Nicholas.

1295
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,640
It's an anonymous user, but we're gonna call him Peter Boyle.

1296
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,280
What's up, buddy?

1297
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,000
Thanks for listening.

1298
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,960
Were podcasts around in 2006?

1299
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,600
They were, okay.

1300
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,720
This Peter Boyle asks,

1301
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,640
how dangerous would I be in a fight just for the fun of it?

1302
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,640
How dangerous do you think I would be?

1303
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,680
Here are some tips.

1304
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,600
I'm gonna get a big drink of water

1305
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,360
because this is gonna be a lot.

1306
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,280
Here are some tips.

1307
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,480
Some stats.

1308
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,480
Okay, so let's divide this in some factors first.

1309
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,840
Speed, stregt, and strategy.

1310
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,280
I think stregt is strength.

1311
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,800
Stregt is strength?

1312
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,920
Yes, okay.

1313
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,920
Okay, so I'm very fast and I'm good on reflexes.

1314
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,120
As for my stregt,

1315
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,320
I can do 50 push-ups without doing workout for a while.

1316
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,240
When I used to work out, I was able to do 80, even a 100 once.

1317
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
And as for my strategy,

1318
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
in fighting, the objective is simple.

1319
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,760
Put the enemy on the floor.

1320
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,760
To me, there are no rules in fighting

1321
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,680
unless it is an official fight like boxing.

1322
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,720
But if it's not, then I ain't got no rules.

1323
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,520
I'll try to get a hot the opponent furs like,

1324
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,640
let him throw first punch,

1325
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,920
duck, punch him in the gut at max stregt,

1326
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,440
and then get right next to him

1327
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,120
and kick on the side of his leg,

1328
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,520
breaking or deslocating his knee.

1329
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,440
Then it's a punch on the back of the head

1330
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,840
and even kicking to the ground if needed.

1331
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,640
And last but not least, kicking in the ribs.

1332
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,200
Of course, there are so many ways this could go wrong,

1333
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,080
but it's an example.

1334
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,440
I rarely have been in fights,

1335
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,280
but I have tough a lot about it,

1336
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
and so I somehow mentalized for it.

1337
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,480
Of course, I will still be nervous,

1338
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,680
but if I decide not to hesitate, then I won't.

1339
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,760
So yeah, pretty much is as soon as I manage to buy myself some time

1340
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,200
after giving a hit,

1341
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,800
it'll aim for the weak spots and make my opponent fall to the ground.

1342
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,600
That was like a sidebar in between.

1343
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,120
So anyway, where was I?

1344
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,200
Pretty much as soon as I managed to buy myself some time

1345
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:19,840
after getting a hit,

1346
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,400
I'll aim for the weak spots and try to make my opponent

1347
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,600
fall to the ground and beat them up.

1348
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,480
As for weapons, that's for another question.

1349
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,200
So what do you think?

1350
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,400
Update.

1351
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,000
Oh, I forgot to mention.

1352
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,680
My abs are really hard.

1353
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,720
So if enforcing them, I can take a punch to them.

1354
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,840
It's like having armor.

1355
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,920
Really not.

1356
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,120
It's really not unless it's like so good.

1357
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,600
Your abs are so good against like knives.

1358
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,200
Like they're that hard.

1359
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,560
I want to watch a video.

1360
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,120
No, don't.

1361
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,800
I don't want to watch some fight video.

1362
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,680
Of this person and this specific person, though,

1363
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,160
like walking up to a fight once they've gotten over their hesitation of worry.

1364
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,680
I wish them the best.

1365
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,040
Like I wish them the best.

1366
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,600
Go with God.

1367
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,960
No, go with God.

1368
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,520
Stand your truth.

1369
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,720
I don't want to watch this person fight.

1370
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,400
I don't want to watch two people fight

1371
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,240
as much as like everybody on Facebook is like,

1372
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,520
watch these two people fight.

1373
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,160
I'm like, no, I don't want to see two people fight.

1374
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,040
Griffin, hear me out.

1375
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,920
Hear me out.

1376
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,200
There is a specific line in this that makes me want to watch it.

1377
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,520
And that is when they say,

1378
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,480
when they throw a punch, I'll duck.

1379
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,040
Yeah.

1380
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,160
Well, that's the first step.

1381
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,120
That line.

1382
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,280
That's like a really amazing like,

1383
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,280
oh, no, I have a plan for punches.

1384
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,400
I know what you're thinking.

1385
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,760
What if they punch you?

1386
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,360
Well, let me stop you there

1387
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,280
because I have a strategy for if they punch me,

1388
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,200
I just won't let them.

1389
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,640
My head won't be there.

1390
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,080
They'll see my head there,

1391
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,520
but then a split second later,

1392
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,200
my head will be down.

1393
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,640
How can you punch what you can't see?

1394
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,240
Oh, punches?

1395
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,080
No, not an ish.

1396
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:56,560
How can you punch-

1397
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,440
I don't know how people keep losing fights, honestly.

1398
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,800
Just don't let them.

1399
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,400
Just don't let them punch you.

1400
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,840
Just don't let them punch you.

1401
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,000
This guy was watching boxing matches just like,

1402
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,680
what are you doing?

1403
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,320
No, your head was up and she'd be down.

1404
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,720
I don't want this guy to get into a fight.

1405
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,480
I just want him to be in the sidelines

1406
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,680
in a new Rocky movie.

1407
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,520
I want him to be ringside.

1408
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,560
I rock.

1409
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,360
He putt.

1410
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,240
You gotta move.

1411
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,280
Listen, listen, if he's going for a punch,

1412
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,960
you gotta move that noggin, my man.

1413
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,160
Down, no down.

1414
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,080
If he gets enough of those punches in,

1415
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,760
you're gonna lose the boxing fight.

1416
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,280
No, flex your abs.

1417
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,240
Flex them.

1418
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,680
The other coach is like,

1419
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,280
ah, shit, that's a great idea.

1420
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,600
Hey, Derek, don't let him,

1421
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,120
don't let him do it.

1422
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,280
Don't let him do it.

1423
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,400
Just move her out.

1424
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:46,720
Yes.

1425
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,440
And this boxing was in there forever.

1426
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,680
Just when you see a punch coming,

1427
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,800
don't be there to receive it.

1428
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,760
Well, where should I be?

1429
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,840
Just left or right or down or up.

1430
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,640
Jump over the-

1431
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,760
Here's my strategy.

1432
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,360
I jump over all the punches.

1433
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,280
Like Mario.

1434
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,400
Like Mario does.

1435
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,800
I'm one of the Mario brothers.

1436
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,880
I'm one of the Super Mario brothers.

1437
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,800
I'm Wah Derek.

1438
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,160
And I jump over your punches.

1439
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1440
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,880
Ba na na na na.

1441
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,600
Nice try.

1442
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,240
Isn't it a shame that if you were Mario

1443
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,360
and you wanted to apply your skills in the boxing ring,

1444
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,080
that it would work exactly once

1445
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,320
and then no one would ever box you again?

1446
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,640
Yeah.

1447
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,440
Because like you jump on somebody's head

1448
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
and it does work and it's amazing.

1449
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,480
And the refs are like,

1450
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,560
we don't have a rule against it.

1451
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,040
And you're like,

1452
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,600
well, I guess I'm in for a new career of boxing.

1453
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,680
No more squishing mushrooms for me.

1454
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,280
But then you try to find another opponent.

1455
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,760
They're like, no, I've pretty much got your number.

1456
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,400
You want to jump on my head.

1457
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,640
So I'd really rather fight anybody else honestly.

1458
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,600
That's actually, Justin,

1459
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,560
why he had to resort to just being a boxing referee.

1460
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,400
True.

1461
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,640
Yeah.

1462
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,080
That's how that career change worked out.

1463
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,240
That's how it happened.

1464
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,560
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1465
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,840
My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1466
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,440
A few things we want to hit on real quick.

1467
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,480
The first is it's that time of year again.

1468
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,720
It's time for the My Brother, My Brother and Me Angels.

1469
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,960
If you've listened to our show before

1470
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,120
in previous Candlelight seasons,

1471
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,920
you know how this works.

1472
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,160
But let me give you the 30 second elevator pitch.

1473
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,320
We come from an area called Huntington West Virginia.

1474
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,280
And in our region, there's a lot of poverty.

1475
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,800
And there are people for whom the holidays

1476
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,160
are not going to be so happy.

1477
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,320
So our local paper, The Hairless Batch,

1478
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,200
puts together a list of people with needs

1479
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,000
throughout our area.

1480
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,520
A lot of them children, a lot of them adults with disabilities,

1481
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,480
elderly folks, whatever.

1482
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,200
People who aren't going to have a Christmas otherwise

1483
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,520
and ask for some small items that they need.

1484
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,400
Toys for some of the kids or clothes

1485
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,120
for people who are trying to get work, that kind of thing.

1486
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,280
Can I give just a quick example of a couple

1487
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,400
of the items, Juice?

1488
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,280
Sure, yeah.

1489
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,160
For example, people asking for help with bus passes.

1490
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,360
People asking for help with winter coats

1491
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,040
and pots and pans.

1492
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,880
These aren't frivolous wish list items.

1493
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,800
These are things that people just need a little help with

1494
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,920
to be able to get by and provide for their families

1495
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,440
and take care of themselves.

1496
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,760
So if you want to help people in our area,

1497
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,280
and it means so much to us,

1498
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,920
we have a website now built by some kind listeners

1499
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,720
that is really helping to make this process

1500
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,400
a lot more manageable, I think.

1501
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,360
So thanks to Jeremy and Willem and everybody

1502
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,360
who has helped out with this project.

1503
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,240
It's mbambangels.com is the website.

1504
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,280
And here's how it works.

1505
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,520
You go to mbambangels, you find somebody

1506
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,480
that you want to help.

1507
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,960
You call the organization to see

1508
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,760
if your item is still unclaimed

1509
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,280
because there are folks in our area

1510
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,240
that also see this list.

1511
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,920
So you want to make sure you're not double dipping.

1512
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,240
And if you don't like calling,

1513
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,280
if you're uncomfortable with that,

1514
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,400
there are people on our Facebook group

1515
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,040
that'll do it for you.

1516
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,840
If you just ask, you go there, you claim somebody,

1517
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,680
you buy the thing, you can buy it on Amazon,

1518
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,840
just have it shipped to wherever they're at

1519
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,000
and you mark them as completed and that's done.

1520
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,600
We've had 64% of these gifts, these stockings be filled.

1521
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,120
And that's amazing, but we really want

1522
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,160
to try to get everybody.

1523
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,960
So if you have a little time and some extra cash,

1524
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,360
oh, by the way, you can also just donate money.

1525
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,400
There's some bigger ticket items

1526
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,080
that people are sort of chipping in on together.

1527
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,160
You can do that too, the details are on the website.

1528
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,160
But if you can do that, it will make you feel great

1529
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,880
and it really does mean a lot to people.

1530
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,680
So that website again is mbambangels.com.

1531
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,120
So please, if you can, go help out, it means a lot.

1532
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,880
I also want to say there's another opportunity

1533
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,800
for giving this holiday season,

1534
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,320
if you're looking for other ways to help out.

1535
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,440
Patrick Rothfuss, who is a friend of the show,

1536
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,800
he's been on an episode before

1537
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,200
and it's also just like super cool dude.

1538
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,680
Good dude.

1539
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,400
He started a charity called World Builders

1540
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,680
that's spearheaded by a bunch of awesome authors

1541
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,080
and it supports Heifer International,

1542
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,680
Mercy Corps and First Book.

1543
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,440
Basically a lot of stuff to help out like kids,

1544
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,760
kids who need food, kids who need water,

1545
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,760
kids who need help learning.

1546
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,480
And what you do is you go and for every $10 you donate,

1547
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,880
you get entered into a lottery to win cool stuff.

1548
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,280
So it's mutually beneficial

1549
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,640
and you get to do a little bit of good.

1550
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,320
And right now we have our own fundraising team.

1551
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,200
You can go join team Mbimbambino,

1552
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,960
just go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-W-B

1553
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,320
and maybe consider giving like 10 bucks and helping out.

1554
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,880
I want to beat all the other fucking teams.

1555
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,480
I do want to do that too, yeah.

1556
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,720
I want to grind them down into the dirt

1557
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,320
and make them ashamed.

1558
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,600
Yeah, I want them to be embarrassed

1559
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,280
they ever wanted to help anybody.

1560
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,480
Yeah, that'll teach them.

1561
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,960
Take that you philanthropic assholes.

1562
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1563
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,840
for the use of our theme song

1564
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,880
it's a departure off the album,

1565
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,760
Putting the Days to Bed.

1566
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,000
It's a wonderful album that you should go get

1567
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,720
and buy it as a holiday present for yourself

1568
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,240
or your kin and your friends or whatever.

1569
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,440
Also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1570
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,960
It's a really, really great network,

1571
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,400
something we're really enthusiastic about.

1572
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,160
All the shows on it are super great.

1573
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,720
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org

1574
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,480
or if you want to listen to other podcasts with us

1575
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,000
or videos with us, go to McElroyShows.com

1576
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,000
and you can find all our projects there.

1577
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,240
I also want to say two more things.

1578
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,640
One, our candlelight episode is coming up.

1579
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,120
We actually already recorded our candlelight live show

1580
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,320
but because that's attached to the TV show

1581
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,760
you won't be able to hear that for a while.

1582
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,200
So we'll still record.

1583
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,040
Yeah, we'll still record a candlelight episode

1584
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,240
so that you have something to listen to.

1585
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,480
All beans, all beans though.

1586
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,640
All beans, but we need your candlelight questions.

1587
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,080
So make sure when you mail those in

1588
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,680
put candle nights in the subject line

1589
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,760
so it's easy for us to like group those all together.

1590
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,240
Also, we have a Facebook group

1591
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,520
which we haven't mentioned in a while

1592
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,040
and I think last time I checked

1593
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,680
we had over 20,000 members in that Facebook group.

1594
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,440
Jesus. Which is humbling.

1595
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,480
So we have added some new moderators

1596
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,560
to the Facebook group to kind of help manage that.

1597
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,480
So I wanted to just say a special thank you

1598
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,600
to Rachel, Wesley, Stormy, Lucy, and Anthony

1599
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,760
for taking on roles as moderators of the group

1600
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,520
so that we don't end up with literally 1300 people

1601
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,000
waiting to be led into the group.

1602
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,320
So thank you for helping out as moderators.

1603
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,520
We done?

1604
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,200
You know, I want that final.

1605
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,240
That's gonna do it.

1606
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,440
All right, this final Yahoo was sent in by Shannon Cowell.

1607
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,480
Thank you, Shannon.

1608
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,120
It's by Yahoo answer user Jake McAwful who asks...

1609
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,000
Is a shrimp a baby lobster?

1610
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,880
I'm Justin McElroy.

1611
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1612
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1613
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,840
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

1614
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:08,800
Square on the lips.

1615
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,200
Are you in need of a shake up?

1616
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,280
Max Fun Con is our annual comedy and creativity festival

1617
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,520
and it changes lives.

1618
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,720
Max Fun Con West returns to Lake Arrowhead next June

1619
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,240
and Max Fun Con East is back in the Poconos next September.

1620
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,400
Tickets for both are on sale right now and they will sell out.

1621
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,440

1622
01:04:41,440 --> 01:05:01,040
