1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,680
What's up, sports fans? You've tuned in once again to Hoop Bros. It's a slam dunk.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, and I've got March Madness. It's clinical.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy, and I'm taking it to the hole.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,200
What? Oh, sorry guys. I think I'm just coming down with a touch of basketball fever.

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,120
You have to say your name. Griffin McElroy. I have basketball fever.

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Griffin McElroy, basketball fever man. It sounds more like a confession than AA.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
So we are the Hoop Bros. It's March Madness, and that means only one thing.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,960
This is just layout central. I hear the Blue Devils got a stern talking

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
to by the Tar Heels last night in terms of basketball points.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:49,680
Who was dunking more sweet on which one? Willis went balls to face on Reginald in dunk mode.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,360
Wow. Just full on dunking right on him. It was a nasty, he jumped from the half court,

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,160
and he stretched his arms and legs out, and all the Monstars grabbed onto his legs,

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360
but he still stretched his arm all the way out. You're drifting into space jam.

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,560
Space jam again. What is it? We talked about how we're not gonna let you on Hoop Bros anymore

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,480
if you keep talking about space jam. But this wasn't a work of Looney Tunes fiction. This was...

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,720
Looney Tunes fact. Looney Tunes fact. Travis,

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,720
let's take it to Trav's Corner. This is our weekly segment where Trav gets

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,080
pretty deep into basketball, b-ball strategy. Trav, how important is it to get more points

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
in the other team? I've been doing a lot of number crunching, and my statistics look like

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,320
it's real important. Travis, now can you tell me what's a good score to have and get?

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,840
Uh, I don't know, like 12? 12 is...

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
13? Maybe like 13 points? I don't mean to, I know that you are our

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
resident math magician, but it seems like there are a lot of numbers higher than that.

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,240
Yeah, but that's like just an improbability that someone would score higher than 13. Do you know

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,440
how hard you have to be working to score more than 13 points? Maybe Wilt the Stilt Chamberlain

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,760
could do it, but that's it. Pretty sure he scored a hundo in one game.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
What?! He got like a hundred points in one game.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
And then he immediately died. Yeah, like his heart exploded.

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,800
Now, Travis, points in basketball are awarded by judges. How can you really wow them to make

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,200
sure they're assigning you a lot? It's all about the flair, Justin. It's all

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,040
about your spin and twirl as you do it. You can't just put the ball into the hole. You have to like

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
spin around when you do it, maybe stick out your tongue. Just a little bit of flair to make you

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:48,080
stand out. The new rule in the NBA is that if you yell your catch phrase mid-dunk, you get bonus

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,600
points for that. Or maybe you just yell like, dunking donuts! Or something like draining them!

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,920
And then you drain them. People like that. People like draining them. That's Kobe's.

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,600
Does Kobe say draining them, or is he like- He doesn't have to now because it's become so

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,680
much a part of his repertoire that people say it for him. Oh, like everybody else yells it.

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Yeah, the other four guys on the team just sing it out like a chorus.

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,800
It's beautiful, actually. It's haunting. It's actually really touching.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,920
It's actually pretty lovely. That sounds actually really nice.

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,320
But to be fair- Oh, sorry guys, that's the buzzer. That does it for the Hoop Bros.

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
For this week, don't want to get a technical foul, gotta pass the show over

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,840
to my brother. My brother and me will see you next week.

48
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, that was a good bit.

49
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
That was a real solid goof we just did for a long time.

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm committing us actually to doing it every week in March.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh, you want to do Hoop Bros from now on?

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,720
Hoop Bros from now on, every week in March is Hoop Bros week.

53
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
This is my brother, my brother and me, actually. It's not really-

54
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,840
Well, the other show was a sports show that we do.

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
This is the other side of the coin.

56
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
It's the flip side of that coin. It's my brother, my brother,

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
me and the advice show from the modern era. We've already introduced ourselves,

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
so I feel like we should get right into the advice.

59
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,560
I feel like it's a bizarro world and Hoop Bros is the polar exact opposite of what our show really is.

60
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,760
Except for the fact that pretty much all the insight it espouses is useless.

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah, except for that.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
Except for it's complete just sort of useless.

63
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,960
Somewhere in an alternate universe, there is three McElroy brothers that are just so on point with sports.

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,160
There might be some in this universe, they just don't have a podcast inside our podcast.

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,320
Hey, about two months ago, I moved into a new apartment. Great spot, love it.

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,880
But a few weeks ago, someone moved into the apartment above me.

67
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,560
He's loud and obnoxious, stomps around whenever he walks,

68
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,160
and on an almost daily basis has loud, drunken conversations with his friends really late at night,

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
often until two or three in the morning.

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,200
I have to live here for the rest of the year, and he'll be here for at least as long.

71
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
What is the etiquette in this situation?

72
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,640
Should I march up there and tell him to keep it down?

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
Should I leave a note in his mailbox?

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
Or should I just leave it alone and get used to it?

75
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
Can't sleep in San Francisco.

76
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you know that there is a body, an agency, that will just take care of this for you?

77
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:32,960
Really?

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,920
What do you call them, Griffin?

79
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,600
I call them the police.

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Griffin, stop snitching.

81
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
We talked about this.

82
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Snitches get stitches, Griffin.

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,160
There are a number of horrible crimes that you can do in this world, and snitching is high up on them.

84
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
But keeping me up at two in the morning after I just drank a bottle of red wine because I watched

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
a really sad episode of The Bachelor, guess what?

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's the highest crime in the land.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
But here's the thing.

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Here's the problem with this, and people have dealt with this for ages, for eons,

89
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,400
and that is once you call the police, now you're that dude,

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
and you have to keep living in that same apartment underneath the other guys.

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,760
Do you think that the police, when the police roll up and they're like,

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,400
hey, Roger down in 403 just called us up, what a little bitch.

93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,720
No, they say like you got complaints from your neighbors, but like clearly it's the guy below them.

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,680
It's the guy below them.

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
They don't have to know which neighbors.

96
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
You have plausible deniability.

97
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
What if it's the guy above them?

98
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,240
You don't know it's the guy below them.

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,960
It could be anybody.

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,000
It could be the guy adjacent.

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Why would you assume people below you are calling the cops?

102
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,800
I rarely even think about people below me as even existing in the world.

103
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
I live in a duplex.

104
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
So if I get called up, the fucking jig is up.

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,600
He's like, fucking Roger, you bitch.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,920
I'll walk next door and be like, hey, Carl, what gives?

107
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Is this you or Rosario?

108
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Who fucked me?

109
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
Thought we were gonna stop snitching.

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,560
Thought we had agreed upon that, but I guess that's not our policy now.

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,600
Whatever you do, do not leave them a note in the mailbox.

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
It gives me chills.

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,360
That gives me chills.

114
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Don't do that ever.

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
Tape a note to their car.

116
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,000
Excuse me.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Hey, excuse me.

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,520
Excuse me.

119
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
Sorry to have a good day, smile.

120
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm just, oh, three o'clock's pretty late to be chatting with your bros, don't you think?

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
If you could just keep it down.

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,920
We used to get notes from the woman who lived in an apartment building Sidney and I used

123
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
to live in.

124
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,080
And she was also an insane person who was living in the building at a discounted rate

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
because she would take care of odd jobs.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Sort of like a dumb superintendent, a less than super superintendent, if you will.

127
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,000
And I remember in one of her classic notes, she left it taped to our door in this sort

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,400
of insane person scrawl with like backwards R's and whatnot.

129
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
It just said, I will take your Christmas tree for you.

130
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
This was in January.

131
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
I will take your Christmas tree away for you.

132
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
What do you want?

133
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,080
There was no instruction on how the handoff would happen if she was just going to break

134
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,360
in the back door.

135
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,160
What I'm building a Christmas tree friend and I need yours.

136
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm so hungry, hungry for trees.

137
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm making pine soup.

138
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
Please give me your trees.

139
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,880
Was she affronted by the fact that it was after Christmas and then you still had your

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,440
tree up?

141
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
Is that what the situation was?

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,960
No way.

143
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,680
She could have seen.

144
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, I guess it was in the window, so maybe she did see.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
But it was like January four, I mean, it was nothing.

146
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Yeah, guys, it's, it is, what is it now?

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
March three, take them down.

148
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,760
And there are like, my neighbors still have Christmas lights up like on their house.

149
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Now, do you think that's confusing?

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
Cause it's like Austin and there is no change of seasons.

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
So there's like waiting for Easter and we're waiting for the next big holiday, I guess.

152
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
I think it might be more that it's awesome.

153
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
And so people are kind of zany and crazy.

154
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,640
They're kind of zany and like, yeah, this is my only source.

155
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
He's trying to keep Austin weird.

156
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
It's my only source of lighting now.

157
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Guys, I love Auntie Mame as much as the next dude.

158
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,800
You got, and I love, I love Free Spirits.

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,120
You're taking, every time you use up Christmas magic in February or March, that's Christmas

160
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
magic that we will not have come December.

161
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
It's not a renewable resource.

162
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,760
No, it's not.

163
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
The government has some reserves, but we can't really get a release that on the year without

164
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,240
a Christmas.

165
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,920
This is why I'm such a strong, I'm such a strong proponent of drilling in Alaska for

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
more Christmas juice.

167
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,600
Yeah.

168
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,760
Yeah.

169
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,880
Me too.

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
They're like, it's going to harm the wildlife.

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,520
And I'm like, fuck the wildlife.

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
I need my eggnog.

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,480
Yeah.

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
Ironically, it will kill many, many reindeer to do so.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
Highly toxic to them.

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,320
But I think, I think it's worth it.

177
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,840
Did you guys see, I think it was last month that there was a big Christmas spill in the

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,160
ocean.

179
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,280
Oh my God.

180
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,720
Yeah, and they were just like, there were just birds washed up on the shore, just covered

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,760
in tinsel.

182
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Was it, was it a Hallmark rig?

183
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,040
Yeah.

185
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,920
So sad.

186
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
The SS Hallmark.

187
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,240
They're so wildly irresponsible with their Christmas sauce.

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
The boats are so old.

189
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
That's the problem.

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,120
They've been using them since, I don't know, since Dudley Moore found Santa again.

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
I forget when that was.

192
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,640
It was a long time ago though.

193
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Guys, how about a Yahoo answer?

194
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
Yes, please.

195
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
That was creepy.

196
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
This one was sent in by Graham Wetterburn.

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,680
Thank you, Graham.

198
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,400
It's by Yahoo.

199
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Good name, Graham.

200
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,800
Yeah, it's by Yahoo Answers user Raj, who asks, why does Dilbert's tie curve up?

201
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,160
Scott Adams said in an interview with groundreport.com, no one really knows, including me.

202
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
Dilbert started as a doodle before I knew he would be famous.

203
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
I don't remember what I was thinking the day I decided to curl his tie up.

204
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,360
WikiAnswers' search tells me, A, it's a metaphor for his inability to control his environment.

205
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
B, he's just glad to see you.

206
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,040
But IMO, a mini hurricane surrounds him and keeps flapping his tie, smile face.

207
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
To all Dilbert fans, what do you think?

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,080
Oh, God.

209
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Who thinks about Dilbert this much?

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Apparently not even Scott Adams could be troubled to figure out why his dumb tie is standing up.

211
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,720
Man, when you ask this-

212
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,400
He's too busy hating women.

213
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah.

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,960
When you ask the sexist creator of Dilbert, like, hey, what's the deal with the tie?

215
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,480
He's like, fuck it, I don't know.

216
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,960
Stop pursuing that line of questioning.

217
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,200
Yeah.

218
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,360
Why is his tie sticking up?

219
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Because she didn't cook it long enough in the kitchen.

220
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, Scott Adams.

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,040
Oh, shit.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Why is his tie sticking up?

223
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
Why are you not having kids?

224
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,880
Get out of my face, Scott Adams.

225
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,440
Hold on.

226
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,080
I really think this Scott Adams character is going somewhere.

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,160
I mean, why don't you workshop it and come back?

228
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,800
Justin's going to go workshop his Scott Adams character.

229
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,720
Travis and I are going to goof on the original cue, but Justin's going to go off.

230
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,920
You guys go forward and I will dip back in a little bit with some more Scott Adams.

231
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
Let me give you a setup.

232
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
It's Scott Adams in a pet shop that's run by a woman.

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay, good, good, okay.

234
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,720
I also like the person who ever said number two, he's just happy to see you.

235
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Dilbert's just got himself a tie bow in there.

236
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,280
Nothing weird.

237
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,800
Nothing weird about that.

238
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
He's got a tie erection.

239
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,640
I think it's suggesting that Dilbert is so bound to his job that his tie has literally

240
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,840
become a part of his body and when blood flow increases to the tie, it forms a fully erect

241
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,320
phallus.

242
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,640
And he has a really curvy wiener.

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,040
Yeah.

244
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
Well, that's just like a hook, like a fish hook wiener.

245
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
It's just a half chub.

246
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
If it was a full chub, his tie would be sticking straight out from his neck.

247
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,200
Why are these poodles so expensive?

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,120
Must be your time of the month.

249
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Well, there he is.

250
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
Hey, Scott Adams, ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,920
Closer.

252
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,480
What's next?

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,480
What's our next scenario?

254
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,800
Scott Adams is an astronaut going to the moon with a female astronaut.

255
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,960
Okay, I'll check you in a bit.

256
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,480
This is the kind of question, right, that somebody doesn't just, like, ask.

257
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
Like, that they-

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,560
Well, they did ask it.

259
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,680
No, but I'm saying, like, this isn't like, oh, just popped in my head what's up with

260
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,400
Dilbert's tie.

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Like, they've stared at Dilbert like every Sunday.

262
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Here's a few excerpts from my thesis, my master's thesis.

263
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,160
What's the deal with Dilbert?

264
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,480
I mean, there are a couple of answers from people who say,

265
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,800
uh, uh, Adams has also hinted that the tie may just be displaying an aversion to him.

266
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
We may never truly know why Dilbert's tie does what it does.

267
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Dilbert's tie doesn't do shit.

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,360
It's not a real thing.

269
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,560
A dude draws it and he doesn't know why he does it that way.

270
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,960
Like, there's no deeper truth.

271
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,040
I just heard Justin inhale sharply, which makes me think he's ready to give us his Scott

272
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
Adams Goes to the Moon goof.

273
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,120
Why are you even coming, Angela?

274
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,840
The moon's made of green cheese, not malls.

275
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Yeah, I feel like your first opus was a little stronger.

276
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,320
And he's also starting to mutate a little bit into the Wolfman.

277
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm starting at 1.7.

278
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
Can I have, can I have one more?

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, God.

280
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,840
I need to redeem myself.

281
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Scott Adams is getting married.

282
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Okay, got it.

283
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Yahoo Answers user question mark responded to me.

284
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,600
I think that Dilbert's tie curves up to give him some individuality.

285
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,080
He works at one of those office settings where he is really just another number and paycheck.

286
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
Nobody's special.

287
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
He could replace it any time and nobody would notice.

288
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,280
I think the curve of his tie makes him stand out, even though nobody really comments on it.

289
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,360
Hey, I think you're projecting a little bit, bro.

290
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Maybe just a touch?

291
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,280
And maybe Dilbert's there and Angela and Accounting just doesn't want to talk to him,

292
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,000
even though he's a super nice guy and he offered to make her dinner.

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
And that's why his tie curves up.

294
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
It's hard, man.

295
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,600
He just gets repressed by his triangular boss.

296
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
And his dog talks, which is pretty cool.

297
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
His dog talks and his cat is like an evil scientist.

298
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,280
I haven't read it in a while.

299
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,640
Yeah, it's been a while.

300
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,680
But there's an intern or something and they're real.

301
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,280
Do you remember we used to have that Dilbert screensaver and-

302
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,080
Yeah, the Dilbert desktop games.

303
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,320
Man, when I was nine, that was a jam.

304
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
Yeah, we played some real dumb shit.

305
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
Hey Justin, you got that goof ready for us?

306
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,280
For all that you are and all that you will be

307
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,280
and all that we will be together, I do.

308
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,520
I want you to get in the kitchen and make me some hamburger helper.

309
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
Scott Adams.

310
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,300
Shit.

311
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,040
Is this the first libel we've ever done?

312
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
Nah, it's definitely a libel.

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,400
But Scott Adams is listening to this right now thinking,

314
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
how did I get on that podcast?

315
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,960
It's probable.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
I don't remember doing this.

317
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
It must have been another misogyny bender.

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Another loss weekend.

319
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
Another weekend lost to hating women and myself

320
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,360
and loving television and loving making subpar comics.

321
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,760
I'm gonna cut out that last bit.

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,800
That's too mean, Justin.

323
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,680
Okay.

324
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,160
What?

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,360
Dilbert is not subpar.

326
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,480
Thanks.

327
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,040
Thanks for-

328
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,680
Thanks, Griffin.

329
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,880
You complete me.

330
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,440
Hey, I have a problem with people taking me seriously.

331
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
And it has a lot to do with how I look.

332
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,120
But I have a baby face.

333
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,800
You got baby face?

334
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
Baby face.

335
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
I can't not say baby face like the way we sound.

336
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
I have a baby face.

337
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,360
I typically get carded for R-rated movies

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,760
and at the hospital I work at, clients always call me kiddo.

339
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Oh, no.

340
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
Buddy or something like that.

341
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
Sport, tiger.

342
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They also tend to question my, I almost said existence.

343
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
That's not what he said.

344
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
They tend to question, but they're not that old.

345
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
They tend to question my experience,

346
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,680
even though I have been at my job for eight years.

347
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,400
I've tried growing a beard, but it comes in very patchy.

348
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
Any suggestions?

349
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
That's from Darling Doctor.

350
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,440
Well, I know the obvious answer.

351
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,320
What's that, Travis?

352
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,560
You need a sweet ass scar across one eye.

353
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,240
Yeah, cut yourself on the face.

354
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
You're gonna need a wicked, like,

355
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,960
something like I got this in the jungles of the Congo kind of scar.

356
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
Mm-hmm, something brutal.

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Yeah, so you can go with that.

358
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,360
And you're a doctor, so you got a steady hand.

359
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,920
Go to town.

360
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
You can also, with some baby powder in the hair

361
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,840
and a stipple brush, make a pretty convincing aging makeup.

362
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
Look at, take a Benjamin Button, for example.

363
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,640
He was not really an old man.

364
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,080
What?

365
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah, I know.

366
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
So if you can get some of that,

367
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
some of whatever they were doing.

368
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
I do not understand it, but whatever they were doing,

369
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
there's a way to make yourself look older.

370
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
So it sounds like you're saying the answer,

371
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
as to many problems, the answer is movie magic.

372
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,040
Just stipple it a little bit.

373
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,800
Do you stipple, Darling Doctor?

374
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,160
Do you stipple?

375
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
Have you tried stippling?

376
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,680
Did you even consider trying stippling?

377
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,640
Maybe like different grades of stipple brush.

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
Hey, here's a freebie, by the way, guys.

379
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
Don't pay $3 for a stipple brush.

380
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
Get an air conditioning filter and cut it into cubes.

381
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,200
Yeah, silly bitch.

382
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,720
God damn it.

383
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
All your money on stipple brushes, down the drain.

384
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,480
I see people fucking just going bankrupt

385
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
buying stipple brushes and foam wedges.

386
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
And then they're just standing by the side of the road.

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
And yeah, their fake beard looks great,

388
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,480
but there's signs like, I stippled myself out of a job.

389
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
You don't need to go buy a box of foam wedges.

390
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,360
I'll just buy a Tempur-Pedic mattress and cut it up

391
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
and then use the, you can get like 10,000 wedges

392
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
out of one mattress.

393
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Lifetime supply.

394
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
Lifetime of it.

395
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,240
Basically, so aging makeup, movie magic,

396
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,320
there's two, scar, that's three.

397
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,760
Man, I feel like we're being super helpful today.

398
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,480
Well, you could just start using words like 23 skidoo

399
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
and calling other people kiddo.

400
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
Maybe walk with a cane.

401
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Wait a minute, a cane is good.

402
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
I like that.

403
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
But they might think you have scoliosis.

404
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,160
You could go house.

405
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
No, you could go full on house.

406
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
No one calls Dr. House kiddo.

408
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,280
No, they don't.

409
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,560
They're too afraid of his mean ways.

410
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,640
You're gonna have to go full on house.

411
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,160
You gotta go just like House did it.

412
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
I bet that's like, doctors are just like sick of that comparison.

413
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,120
Like people like rolling up to the hospital and be like,

414
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
so which one of you guys is like the house of the different?

415
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm just like, God, no one's house.

416
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
It's not a real thing.

417
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,800
It's not a real thing.

418
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,280
If you did that for like a day, you get fired forever.

419
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
Because the one thing-

420
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,760
He just takes pills all the time.

421
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,800
If there's one thing hospitals love more than a guy who cracks them all,

422
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,920
it's a guy who doesn't get sued to do oblivion every other week.

423
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
Can you put phone books on your feet and walk around?

424
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,320
Okay.

425
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,960
Well, then they call you old elephant foot.

426
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,400
That might look kind of ridiculous.

427
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
Can you get a long trench coat?

428
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
And sit on a short person's shoulders.

429
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
You get another young looking doctor and you guys team up.

430
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,080
Oh my God.

431
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,320
Because then you would be tall as two short doctors,

432
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,160
but you would also like have the brain of two doctors.

433
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,080
You would be the smart,

434
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,480
that he'd be whispering up to you like, check his blood and bones.

435
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
Oh, and you can say like, I need to consult a surgeon

436
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,040
and you just like duck your head inside your jacket.

437
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,560
And you put your head back up and you say,

438
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,440
don't worry, my dick is a surgeon or so I've been told.

439
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
And now he's ready to operate is the rest of that.

440
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,680
Yeah.

441
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,120
That's the, the, the, the cherry on top of that fucking yucky Sunday.

442
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
It sounds like you're setting up, like,

443
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
you need to start doing some experiments with like chemicals and stuff.

444
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
And you're going to get yourself into a big situation.

445
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,640
And you're like, I want to be big.

446
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,160
Is that how big happened?

447
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
No, big wasn't chemical based.

448
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay.

449
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
But I'm, I'm telling you, I'm taking the non.

450
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,440
It was nuclear, nuclear radiation.

451
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,920
Zartan.

452
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,720
Yeah.

453
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,000
Zartan is a real.

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
You're talking about a real life.

455
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,320
Chemicals are real.

456
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,200
That's, that's good.

457
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,000
Chemicals are real.

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,280
You're just, and maybe it's a movie starring Timothy Daly.

459
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,320
I can see him in it.

460
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,800
Okay.

461
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,960
And he mixes up the chemicals and it makes him look older.

462
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
See, I see this as a book that Travis has written and it's called

463
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
Chemicals Are Real Science by Travis McElroy.

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
It's almost as good as his book about basketball.

465
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
All you want to know about science,

466
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,240
but we're too afraid to ask because it's fucking stupid.

467
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,560
I feel like we've given you some really good hope.

468
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,360
Yeah.

469
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
I mean, I feel like you've got enough.

470
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
I don't know why you're still bothering us.

471
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,280
Cause I feel like we, we really gave you some action items.

472
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,080
Some take homes.

473
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,080
You guys want another, you know, another Yahoo.

474
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah.

475
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,280
Give me somebody else to help.

476
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
I already helped that guy.

477
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Yeah.

478
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,520
This one was sent in by Eric Leiden.

479
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank you, Eric.

480
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah Sparks, who asks,

481
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,720
why did most of my friends turn into whores when we got into middle school?

482
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
Oh no.

483
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Oh, golly.

484
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,160
That's it.

485
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
Is that the whole question?

486
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,560
Oh no.

487
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,640
Okay.

488
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Um, I know.

489
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,840
Listen.

490
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,160
Really?

491
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:35,520
When you, when you hit 11, it is just, you just go full bore now.

492
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
You don't have a choice in the matter.

493
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
You just go full bore.

494
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
Is it 11?

495
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah.

496
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
11's the new 17.

497
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
That's like the saddest thing.

498
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,960
11's the new 15.

499
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Like, like just like 15 year olds in our age, 11 year olds just ramp it, ramp it up.

500
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,120
They ramp it off of a cliff in the, in the sex, sexually irresponsible canyon.

501
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,600
This, see, this is one area where I agree with Rick Santorum.

502
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
Let's lock our preteen girls in cages.

503
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,480
Yeah.

504
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
Well, your own, not other people's.

505
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,520
No, no.

506
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't come into my house and lock my family in cages.

507
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,480
That's my daughter and I will lock her in a cage to preserve her.

508
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,200
Kids grow up too fast, but you can stunt that if you have them in a cage in which they have

509
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
to remain permanently hunched.

510
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,000
Because if you put them in like a round cage, they're going to grow round.

511
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,640
It's really awesome.

512
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,320
That's, Travis, it's not like foot binding.

513
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,360
What are you talking about?

514
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,880
No, it is like, you know, like you grow like a cucumber in a bottle and you get a bottle.

515
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah.

516
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
You put a kitten in a mason jar.

517
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,520
Uh-huh.

518
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:39,840
Yeah.

519
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,400
I feel you.

520
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,640
Don't do that.

521
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,560
That's stupid, but I feel you.

522
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,400
What you got to do is you got to black out.

523
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
You got to SOPA their like Wikipedia.

524
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,560
Because that's how you learn like what a boner is now.

525
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Is that how kids are learning about it?

526
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,560
When you're nine and you get your first boner, the boner fairy visits you.

527
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,920
You know what you do?

528
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,440
You'll hop on Wikipedia and you look up a Wikipedia entry that somebody else wrote.

529
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

530
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,680
People are getting boners at nine?

531
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,640
How are you this ignorant about this topic?

532
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,160
No, you're saying nine?

533
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah.

534
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah, according to Wikipedia, boner is a slang term for an erection of the penis.

535
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,040
Or a Zamboni ice resurfacing vehicle operator.

536
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,400
What is going on down there?

537
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
Or a jazz trombonist.

538
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
Yes, that's one of them.

539
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Or a blunder, which is really funny and I wish we said that more often.

540
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,680
But I'm saying if you don't lock your daughter up before she learns all this stuff,

541
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,200
then you've made a terrible boner.

542
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,880
Yes, she'll start dating a boner or worse, a boner.

543
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,240
And you'll live to regret it.

544
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
Get it, lock them in a cage.

545
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
Before they make a boner boner.

546
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,440
Yeah, and then at 18, you release them into the world, just completely uneducated,

547
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,840
and then they're just so happy and blissfully ignorant.

548
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,480
Yeah, they don't need to know about all this stuff that we know about.

549
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,240
God, do you think, oh, I wish I could go back to the day before I knew how everything worked down there.

550
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,840
Yeah, there's a lot more mystery and a lot more shit.

551
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,280
I just thought it was movie magic.

552
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,800
Like me, myself, and Irene.

553
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,840
Here's a little factoid for you guys.

554
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:39,440
Did you know that there was an American comic strip about a guy in an ark full of animals

555
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,840
written by Mort Walker, creator of Beetle Bailey, and the name of that strip was Boner's Ark.

556
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,520
It stopped running in 2000.

557
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I can't imagine why.

558
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,920
What could have undone this hilarious?

559
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,640
This hilarious, ironically, that is why Dilbert's tie curves because of his Boner's Ark.

560
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Stupid, dumb show.

561
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,240
Can we just say that boners are a high schooler's game?

562
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,400
That's when you should start meddling.

563
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,440
In middle school, you should be more worried about being absolutely and completely ostracized.

564
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
Can we also agree that by the end of college,

565
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,960
you should have had all the boners you're ever going to have?

566
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,800
You've punched your boner card.

567
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,520
You get one more free boner, but then that's it.

568
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
And that's for your wedding night.

569
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,560
It's like that Eddie Murphy movie, A Thousand Words, where he only has that many till he dies.

570
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,480
It's like that movie, Brewster's Millions.

571
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,520
He has a million boners, and if he doesn't have them all in one day,

572
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
then he'll never have another boner again.

573
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,200
Also, the boners belong to an old man before him.

574
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,000
He's borrowing them.

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
He bequeathed his boners.

576
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
It's like that movie on borrowed boners.

577
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,520
It's a good thing they didn't cast a feeler in in that flick,

578
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
or it would have been a short film.

579
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,840
You know what I mean?

580
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,560
Because that's something you could say to make people think you're older.

581
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Also, I've used all my boners up.

582
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
Should work pretty well, too.

583
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,040
My natural boners.

584
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,760
My God-given boners.

585
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
I've used all my natural boners.

586
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,680
Do you have any pills for that?

587
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
I don't want to have another one or I'll die.

588
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,080
This is basically what I'm saying to you.

589
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,560
So I'm so scared.

590
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,680
I only have so much blood, and I need to use it in my essentials.

591
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,520
Hey, how do I handle the immediate derision I get?

592
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,720
The, well, FU snob derision I get when people find out I don't own a TV.

593
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
Hey, I love TV.

594
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,160
I watch TV on my laptop, which often means I see new episodes before they air on real TV.

595
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,600
So I'm beating them at TV.

596
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,840
I shamelessly invite myself over to friends' houses to watch things,

597
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,600
and I will never ever give up my love for admittedly crappy TV medical dramas.

598
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
Is it possible, is it permissible to yell,

599
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
FU, I'm gonna go watch House-

600
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
So much swearing.

601
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
So much swearing.

602
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,640
So much swearing.

603
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
FU, I'm gonna go watch House now at these people and storm off.

604
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,880
Is there any way to defend myself as a normal member of society who loves

605
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
pop culture and just happens to consume it over Wi-Fi rather than cable?

606
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,520
And that is from, I kid you not, the future Mrs. Gregory House.

607
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,160
You are riding on the vanguard of the new television movement.

608
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,920
All those other people, they're the old guard.

609
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,600
You don't have to worry about them anymore,

610
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,200
because they're gonna die soon, like the dinosaurs.

611
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
You are in the fast lane of the information superhighway,

612
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,560
and they're over in the far right lane with their blinker on for like three miles.

613
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,160
Why are you even worried about the judgment of these dinosaurs?

614
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,000
They're extinct.

615
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,040
They're turning into coal and diamonds all around you.

616
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,640
Which will then go to power your internet, your coal-powered internet.

617
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,080
Coal-fired internet, the way grandpa used to make it.

618
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,760
I do not like people who don't have TVs.

619
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,880
Now, stick with me.

620
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,600
Now, stick with me.

621
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,040
No, I don't have anything.

622
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,440
Okay.

623
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,480
I do want to say that everybody should have a TV.

624
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,760
I have like four, so if you want one, I'll just give you one of mine.

625
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
But you do need a TV.

626
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
How else can you get emergency broadcast messages?

627
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,800
I have three TVs in my living room right now.

628
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Jesus Christ.

629
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,000
One for cable, one's hooked up to my video game system,

630
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
and one's just sitting under a table.

631
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,800
It's just there in case one of the other ones stops working.

632
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,480
I haven't had cable in a long, long, long time, but I have a TV.

633
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Is that weird?

634
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
No, because you need it for video games.

635
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,080
I need it for video games.

636
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,440
So you're just saying it's less to you about it being a facilitator for TV watching.

637
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
You just want people to have a TV.

638
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
I trust someone more if they have a TV.

640
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,840
Why do you think you're so cool?

641
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,280
TVs are cheap and they're great.

642
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,320
Just get one.

643
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,760
I know that we're going completely against what this person just asked us.

644
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,240
I disagree with you, too.

645
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,680
But I kind of feel the same way.

646
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,760
When someone tells me, like, oh, I don't own a TV.

647
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,880
I say to them, go, why not?

648
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,320
Just get one.

649
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,920
But I can do all the things I do on my TV on my computers.

650
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,640
No, but you can't.

651
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
Here's one thing that I'm going to hit you with.

652
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,720
Okay.

653
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,880
No one's ever said, like, let's have a communal experience.

654
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,000
It's Christmas Eve.

655
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's all watch It's a Wonderful Life.

656
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,040
Please gather around my 13 inch MacBook Air screen.

657
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,960
No, this is going to be very cozy.

658
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
Flip side of that, nobody's ever said, I don't want to watch the latest episode

659
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,400
in The Bachelor.

660
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,240
Let's pick up my TV and put it in the bed with us.

661
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,880
And we'll just lie.

662
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,920
That's why you have both.

663
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
Yeah, right.

664
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,040
Nobody's like, hey, I'm throwing a big party at my house.

665
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
We're all going to watch the Oscars on my computer.

666
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,080
You are setting yourself up to be a lonely heart because you can't have someone over

667
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,280
to watch House with you.

668
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,080
I want you to live a life that is full of love and companionship.

669
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,400
And you can't do that when you're squinting at your MacBook.

670
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,600
Here's what you need.

671
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,080
You need to get yourself that S-video cable and just like connect your laptop to a TV.

672
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
But they don't have a TV.

673
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,280
They need to get the TV too.

674
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
So you need to get the S-video cable and the TV.

675
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,040
This is the most streamlined advice you've ever given anyone.

676
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
Just go buy a TV.

677
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
If you buy a TV, you get one.

678
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,040
You get one.

679
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,840
Just if you have one, then you, oh, you know what?

680
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
Just tell people you have one.

681
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,740
Yeah.

682
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,240
It's like, yeah, spot checking the neighborhood.

683
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,640
Right.

684
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,200
TVs.

685
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,840
Yeah, I love them.

686
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
I can't get enough.

687
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,720
Because if you can't say that to people, then you really are.

688
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,840
You don't have a TV because of because you like how that sounds.

689
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
You don't want to be that guy.

690
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
Oh, that guy can clean off.

691
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,600
I don't care about him.

692
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,400
I'm glad you're not that guy.

693
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,440
It sounds like you're not that guy.

694
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,040
And I'm proud of you for not being that guy.

695
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,760
Yeah, no, it doesn't sound like you're that guy, but don't be that guy.

696
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,840
Do you think that there were those guys like 50, 60 years ago who were like,

697
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,280
oh, I don't even own a radio.

698
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah, I see those where I see those wavy lines going through the air.

699
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,720
And I'm like, no, thanks.

700
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,600
Keep on going.

701
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,080
What is that?

702
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,680
You can keep your little orphan Annie.

703
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,240
I don't need it.

704
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,600
Oh, that's the Gutenberg press.

705
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,640
No, thanks.

706
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,520
Handwritten for me.

707
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,080
Yeah, I'll just let me get I got a lot of illuminating to do.

708
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
I'll catch you guys next week.

709
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
Like, hey, you know what I do when I need a new TV?

710
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,600
What's that?

711
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,440
I talk about soap.

712
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's go to the money zone.

713
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,520
First trip to the money zone is being paid for by Sean Andrich,

714
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:02,800
who's wishing wishing Carla Andrich a very, very happy birthday.

715
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,320
Technically on Sunday, but we're celebrating it today.

716
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,200
Observed.

717
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040
It's like it's like a birthday time warp because when you listen to this,

718
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,360
it will be Monday, but we are recording this on your birthday.

719
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,320
So it's earnest.

720
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,360
It's earnest birthday wishes, and I think you'll be able to feel that.

721
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Yeah, she's happy birthday.

722
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,400
Okay, she's a dedicated MBMB AM listener and all around awesome lady

723
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,360
who's working on her second novel, loves their two awful cats and is a quote.

724
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,160
I don't want to say this, but I'll say it, and she is a total tiger in the sack.

725
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,560
All right.

726
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,680
Okay, so now the Internet knows that.

727
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Now I know that more importantly, the Internet can go fuck itself with a with a pylon.

728
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,960
I don't care about the Internet, but I care about me having to hear those words.

729
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,600
Hey, I just want to wish her happy birthday and tell the world she rocks my socks.

730
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,880
I know Griffin won't do songs for non-corporate entities, but maybe Justin will.

731
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,920
Okay, will Justin?

732
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,640
Carla's so beautiful to Sean.

733
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,360
It's great.

734
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,320
Can't you see?

735
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
Yeah, something about being a tiger in the sack.

736
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:27,360
She's a tiger in the sack, and now that's something Justin has to know.

737
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,920
That's great.

738
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:37,040
You are so beautiful to Sean.

739
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,160
We really got to find a way to get you on Fox on all of the songs we do from now on.

740
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
You've got a beautiful set of pipes.

741
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah, that was amazing.

742
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,480
It's yeah, thank you.

743
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Thank you very much.

744
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,960
And also, we, of course, want to take a moment to love our friends at Stack Soap.

745
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,720
Stack Soap is you ever have those stupid slivers as I call them?

746
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,080
Trademark where you use the bar soap and it's down to a dumb little sliver

747
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,400
you have to throw away or slip on and die.

748
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,680
Well, not anymore.

749
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,400
Stack Soap is a soap that has a special divot in it that lets you slide the stupid sliver

750
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
right into it.

751
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,560
And so you never end up having to waste it.

752
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,280
If you pledge $10, you're going to get six bars of Stack Soap.

753
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,400
And those kids, you only have nine days to get in on that deal.

754
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,200
And if you go now, you could possibly be the 1000th donor.

755
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,360
Can you believe that?

756
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,080
It's amazing.

757
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,200
Like you guys, you're incredible.

758
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, you guys are really actually crazy for soap.

759
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
But I'm super happy that they have-

760
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,200
Why you guys love soap so much.

761
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
It is dirty.

762
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,880
But go to stacksoap.com, bid on some soap, get in on the ground floor of soap.

763
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:08,480
Now, part of our ongoing engagement with Stack Soap is that Griffin has been working on a

764
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,600
jingle for them.

765
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,720
Griffin, how is that coming?

766
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:10,960
Bad.

767
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,120
People have been asking about it.

768
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,600
Actively poorly.

769
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm on the West Coast, West Coast, Left Coast this week.

770
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,560
People have said, I know John Drake, who works at a music video game company-

771
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
Can't say which one, but-

772
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,640
Can't say which one.

773
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
The only one that hasn't shut down.

774
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,160
Yeah, he works at Harmonyx said, I can't wait.

775
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,520
We're all losing our minds over here at video games.

776
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,120
Everyone at video games can't wait for Griffin to drop this hit.

777
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
And he knows everybody.

778
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,280
He knows Feist, he knows Ravi Shankar, he knows all the music biz.

779
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,240
So this is kind of your shot at the big time.

780
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,480
And I think everyone's, I think we've only got one more week with our friends at Stack Soap.

781
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,200
So like, you really got to drop it on us.

782
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,880
Oh, it's not ready.

783
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Okay, next, but next week-

784
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,040
Next week it'll definitely, definitely be ready.

785
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,040
But this week I've been thinking more about like, I got the chorus down, right?

786
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,600
I got the, put your soap in my soap, right?

787
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah.

788
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,840
I got that part.

789
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,000
But like the verses need something like, I've been trying to think of soap goofs.

790
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Soap goofs.

791
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,960
It's hard to do, isn't it?

792
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
Something like, it's-

793
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,080
Pop a bubble.

794
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,640
Bubble bubble.

795
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,200
I don't want to pop your bubble.

796
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
It ain't no lie.

797
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
And the lie would be L-Y-E.

798
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,360
Uh huh, uh huh, yeah.

799
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
Because it's not in there.

800
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,960
There's no lie in the product.

801
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,400
There's no lie in it?

802
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
As far as I know, no.

803
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,680
No, there's like glycerin or something.

804
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
I could just do a cover of glycerin.

805
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,200
God damn it.

806
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,160
So, um-

807
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
Don't let your skin get dry.

808
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,440
Don't let your skin get dry.

809
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,160
Don't let your grandpa die by slipping on a silver soap.

810
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,800
There it is.

811
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,600
That's, ooh, you're getting really close.

812
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
I want, here's the thing.

813
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,600
When you finally drop that, I want full production.

814
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
I want layered vocals.

815
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,080
Uh, I want, I want guitar effects.

816
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,000
I'd like a drum track if I could.

817
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,800
Okay, so you want me to get-

818
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,840
Can you do the Wawa thing?

819
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,480
I love the Wawa thing.

820
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,880
You want me to fully garage band this shit.

821
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,800
I just want you to garage band it.

822
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,360
Yeah.

823
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,400
I think everybody's ready.

824
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,960
But anyway, that's stacksoap.com.

825
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,120
Don't let your grandpa die.

826
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,600
Buy Stack Soap.

827
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,120
Don't let your grandpa die.

828
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,760
And don't let your grandpa die before he hears

829
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,640
one of the fine programs on the Maximum Fun Network.

830
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,000
What if what you're about to hear about right now.

831
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Hello there, my name's Graham Clark.

832
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,120
And I'm Dave Shumka.

833
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,960
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

834
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,520
This is a file that you download from the internet

835
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,360
and then you listen to it in your pod.

836
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
What's that about, you ask?

837
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
Well, who are you to ask?

838
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,360
Who do you think you are?

839
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

840
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,160
We're a couple of stand-up comedians in Vancouver,

841
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
British Columbia, Canada.

842
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

843
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
Sometimes they're Canadian.

844
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,960
Sometimes they're not.

845
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,320
Sometimes they're a ghost.

846
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,600
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

847
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

848
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,280
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

849
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,200
One of my roommates has a tendency to be up super late

850
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,800
talking to her boyfriend on Skype.

851
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,560
It occurred to me.

852
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,080
No, I'm sorry.

853
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
That is Skype.

854
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,440
It occurred to me recently that our router is in my room

855
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,800
and I'm the only one in the house who is at all cognizant

856
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
of the vagaries of home networking.

857
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,600
Would I be, like, the biggest dick if I logged in

858
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,760
and cut off her internet access for the night?

859
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Or is this totally justified at 3.30 in the goddamn morning

860
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,200
when I just know that that bitch is gonna give me a migraine?

861
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,440
The ladies are fired up this week, right?

862
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,720
They are fired up.

863
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,920
That's from Vivaciously Velourant for Virtual Vengeance

864
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,440
in the Victoria.

865
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,640
How do you know this is a lady?

866
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,360
Vivaciously, I think, tipped me off.

867
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,400
You know what?

868
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,600
If someone woke me up three o'clock in the goddamn morning

869
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,120
talking on Skype, I would melt the router down

870
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,400
to its essential components.

871
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
Forget about logging her off.

872
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm gonna log off the internet forever.

873
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,720
No way.

874
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,200
That dog don't hunt.

875
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,000
It's not my home.

876
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,680
I'm asleep.

877
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,480
You could talk to her about it.

878
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,840
Say, hey, I'm trying to sleep.

879
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,400
Could you please?

880
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,360
You don't have to ruin this expensive piece

881
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,400
of internet technology.

882
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
It's pretty boring, though.

883
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,880
Well, additional details that were edited out for time

884
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
is that she has talked to her and that sometimes

885
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,680
she goes and bangs on her roommate's door.

886
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
But she points out that sometimes it's late at night

887
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,200
and you're real comfy in your bed

888
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,400
and you don't want to get up.

889
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Just reach over, switch off the router.

890
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
Those were salient details, Travis,

891
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,360
and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't

892
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,120
censor them out anymore, SOPA.

893
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,480
When I don't edit things out, I get bitched at

894
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,400
because the questions are three paragraphs long.

895
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,720
Yeah, but then you read them later.

896
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,200
What part of editing for time are you unclear about?

897
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
If you say them later.

898
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,520
They got to hear it in my dulcet tones instead of yours.

899
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,600
Right, you reworked the verbiage.

900
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,360
It breaks it up orally.

901
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,840
Okay, well, then if you've already talked to her about it,

902
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,440
then yeah, I guess violence is the only answer.

903
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
Is that more entertaining?

904
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,080
Shut it down.

905
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,720
Shut it down.

906
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,760
Go full Gallagher.

907
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,440
Wait, what?

908
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,160
Full Gallagher, fucking put it on a big-

909
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,360
You're saying Bludgematic.

910
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,200
No, I think he's saying get up and leave.

911
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,720
No, what?

912
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
Like you would at a Gallagher show.

913
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,200
No, I'm saying,

914
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,680
No, I'm saying I hate these things.

915
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,040
All the kids downloading all their pornography and Googles.

916
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,880
Well, I've got a Google here dot.com.

917
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,600
Smash it.

918
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,720
Is this, was that Scott Adams pretending to be Gallagher?

919
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
Or what's going on?

920
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,520
That's Gallagher.

921
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,360
How can you not tell that's Gallagher?

922
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,600
It's clearly Gallagher.

923
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,120
Do you want to hear my other Gallagher impression?

924
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,680
Yeah, please.

925
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,240
Is this Gallagher 2?

926
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,360
Oh, Crikey.

927
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,080
Wonderwall.

928
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh, Justin.

929
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,320
Now do your Peter Gallagher impression.

930
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,440
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

931
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,120
While you were sleeping, I smashed you with a hammer.

932
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,320
That works on two levels.

933
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,200
Seth Ryan.

934
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,480
Hammer.

935
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,760
We've been going on an OC.

936
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,920
This is the theme song to OC.

937
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,040
He was on the OC.

938
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,360
Sorry?

939
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,720
Peter Gallagher.

940
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,160
What about him?

941
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,360
He played California Dad on the OC.

942
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
Well, he was Surf Lawyer.

943
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,600
Yeah, Surf Dad.

944
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,640
Turn it off.

945
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,560
Turn it off and in the morning just say like,

946
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,280
I guess we had a ping in the middle of the night.

947
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,160
Guess you had some latency.

948
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,880
I guess you used up all the internet.

949
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,400
Sounds like a hack attack to me.

950
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,720
Anonymous came in and just stole our router.

951
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,240
Soap-ed.

952
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,920
I guess you got soap-ed.

953
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,400
It happens.

954
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,520
It happens.

955
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,120
Maybe get politically active and stop the soaping.

956
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,120
WikiLeaks.

957
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,680
You got WikiLeaked.

958
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,880
This Yahoo answer was sent in by question mark.

959
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,400
Thank you, question mark.

960
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tom, who asks,

961
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,280
does anybody else abstain from masturbation, sexual intercourse before a job interview?

962
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,320
And if not, how come?

963
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,360
I apply the same logic to job interviews as some sports teams do to important matches,

964
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,040
and it has become a ritual of mine.

965
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,600
Does anybody else abstain from masturbation, sexual intercourse before a job interview?

966
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,880
And if not, how come?

967
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,960
I need to take these things one at a time.

968
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,680
First off, are people really doing that during sports?

969
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,740
Yeah.

970
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,240
Is that like a thing?

971
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,920
Oh, you know, that's a huge thing for like boxers and football athletes is that you don't,

972
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,640
you know, you don't mess around before a fight, before a big game.

973
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,120
Is that like a full-blown barbarian thing and like it makes them hungry?

974
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah, it's like you're harnessing like your primal energies.

975
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,680
Oh, fuck.

976
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,320
Yeah, right?

977
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,040
It is gross.

978
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,640
That's disgusting.

979
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,160
They also eat a bunch of fettuccine.

980
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,000
Wait a minute.

981
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,200
That's just to carve up.

982
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,840
Coach comes into the locker room, says, sorry, hey, everyone, quit jerking.

983
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,480
Instead, let's go to the Olive Garden.

984
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,840
Yeah, let's go get some free breadsticks.

985
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,880
I'm going to substitute your jerking with some good, good pasta fagioli.

986
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,040
I don't think I would ever call any pasta I've eaten orgasmic.

987
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,920
Saying that's not a very fair trade.

988
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,320
But that is a risk.

989
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,840
What if the breadsticks are too delicious?

990
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,840
I get it.

991
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,160
Right?

992
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,200
Fagiolis, you know, you take a bite and you said this is splendor and there's infinite of it.

993
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,400
Whoops.

994
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,560
Oops.

995
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,040
What happened?

996
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,720
I need a book to explain this to me.

997
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,440
I'll open up Chemicals Are Real by Travis McElroy and figure out this orgasmic situation.

998
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,280
Oh, I just thought that was to kill the, kill the sexual arousal.

999
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,520
It's like you either think about baseball numbers or read.

1000
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,920
Chemicals Are Real.

1001
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,040
Is this a real?

1002
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,120
Fuck, I wish I'd played sports so I knew if this is a real thing and coaches were like,

1003
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,280
I want you guys horny as hell.

1004
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,160
No, I don't think a coach can like legally say that.

1005
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,000
When you are out there on that gridiron, I want you grabbing at those guys.

1006
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,160
I just want you so desperate for any sort of touch.

1007
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,400
I want you hungry for any sort of companionship or connection.

1008
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,720
I want you hungry for basketball points and some touch.

1009
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
I want you to just crave human contact.

1010
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,120
Some kind of affection in this cold, cold world.

1011
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,720
Here's the deal I'm going to make with you guys.

1012
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,600
First guy running in the end zone can jerk off right there.

1013
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,720
No problem.

1014
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,480
That was the original.

1015
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,600
No points until you jerk.

1016
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
No jerking until you point.

1017
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,200
And if you do a field goal, you can do like a bow, like through the clothes rub down.

1018
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,280
That's it.

1019
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,920
Well, that's why fucking, that's why Brett Favre sent that, sent all those ladies pictures

1020
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,080
of his member is because he was so sexually repressed for how long did he play football?

1021
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,520
I think like 53 years.

1022
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,320
He wasn't allowed to jerk it for 53 years.

1023
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,600
Then as soon as he got out of the game for the sixth time, that's why he kept quitting.

1024
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,960
He would quit football, but like I'm done for real this time, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

1025
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,800
Okay guys, he's back for more football.

1026
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,840
And then when he was finally done.

1027
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,720
So for real, he was like, I got to send a picture of myself to everyone.

1028
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,120
And he just immediately lost like 20 pounds.

1029
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,840
Yeah, I wasted so much time.

1030
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,520
He meant to send the picture of his wiener to his team as if to say,

1031
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,960
look how good I'm going to be at football.

1032
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,680
This is how red I am for football this time.

1033
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,880
Oh Jesus.

1034
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
This has been a real sports heavy show.

1035
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,720
I think I love that the gentleman who has asked this question

1036
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,080
feels the need to say like, does anyone not do this?

1037
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,280
If so, why not?

1038
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,200
Yeah, like because they're not fucking crazy.

1039
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,720
There's a billion reasons why not.

1040
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,800
Well, let's get back to the original query, which was not sports related,

1041
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,160
but for a job interview.

1042
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,520
I really want this job so bad.

1043
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,240
That's what you need, especially if you have a job interview with a member

1044
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,680
of the opposite sex or the same sex if that's your bag

1045
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,000
that you find devastatingly attractive.

1046
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,880
That's what you need is the distraction of your sexual organs telling you

1047
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,160
it's time to procreate.

1048
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,600
Yeah, that's what happened to Gilbert.

1049
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,640
He had his interview with Triangle Boss and he was like,

1050
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,560
want to have that.

1051
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,600
Yeah, he's actually always interviewing for a job to leave the crappy job he's at.

1052
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,680
So he always has a tie boner.

1053
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,920
I've interviewed for a lot of jobs and I've interviewed a lot of people for jobs.

1054
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,080
No job interview is that important.

1055
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,680
No, no job interview is worth putting your sexual tiger in a cage.

1056
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,000
What skills are you trying to improve upon?

1057
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Like if I don't jerk it before this, I'll be better with eye contact.

1058
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,440
Like what are you bringing to this job interview besides your boner?

1059
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Employers can sense willpower.

1060
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,280
So I think that's more what it's like instead of prolonging the boner magic.

1061
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,840
I think it's more about, oh, so you didn't jerk it today?

1062
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,520
I like the cut of your jib.

1063
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,120
I'm impressed.

1064
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,360
So you're envisioning a scenario where the dude has left the interview

1065
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,440
and the boss is like, well, he's got a solid resume,

1066
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,560
but I just got the impression that he jerked it before he came here.

1067
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,240
So where's the dedication?

1068
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,600
You can, can you not tell?

1069
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,480
I can tell.

1070
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,920
I thought everyone could tell.

1071
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,600
Well, I mean, I guess if I had like 30 years experience in a job industry,

1072
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,640
you know, like in a field and I was interviewing someone,

1073
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,120
I could probably be like, oh, that's a young man who jerked it today.

1074
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,360
We don't need him here at Sears Roebuck.

1075
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,480
That's where people get jobs, right?

1076
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:50,400
Though I don't subscribe to this, I have heard of needing to pee.

1077
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,640
Like drinking a lot and then needing to pee when you go into a job interview

1078
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,080
or perhaps a theater audition, you use that energy.

1079
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,120
And biologically speaking, that's basically the same thing.

1080
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,800
Well, that's an old actor trait.

1081
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,000
You got pee, you use it.

1082
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
Several problems I have with the things you just said.

1083
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:07,840
Okay.

1084
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,240
Name one.

1085
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,560
Well, for one, you're saying that making pee

1086
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,800
and the beautiful magic of the human orgasm is the same thing?

1087
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

1088
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,000
It's like sneezing.

1089
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,040
Sneezing, having to pee, orgasm, they're all basically the same thing.

1090
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
It's your body getting evil out of you.

1091
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,120
Yeah.

1092
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,920
That's why you do it in the dark by yourself when you cry.

1093
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,640
That's what I believe, Griffin, and I have a right to believe that.

1094
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,800
Second problem.

1095
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,160
If you're in a job interview and you use that energy

1096
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,360
and you piss your pants in front of another man or woman,

1097
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,680
you don't get that job.

1098
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,720
I'm sorry you don't get that job.

1099
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,400
Unless you pee your pants, say-

1100
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,120
There's no way a sentence that starts with unless you pee your-

1101
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,240
Oh no, you can totally use it.

1102
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,640
You look at the boss and say, I am so committed to this business

1103
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,040
that I will literally pee my pants right now

1104
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,640
if that's what will get me the job.

1105
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,080
And then you do it before he can answer.

1106
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,160
I will pee my pants for this AutoZone.

1107
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,640
You pee your pants and you say, if peeing pants is cool,

1108
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,600
I'm Miles Davis.

1109
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,080
And then say, get it, like in Billy Madison.

1110
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,600
And then just stare at him until you have a-

1111
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,440
Now that only works if you're interviewing for Adam Sandler.

1112
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,520
Yeah, if you're interviewing for Adam Sandler,

1113
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,040
he's really going to appreciate that deep-

1114
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,640
The real problem is if you hold in pee and you don't jerk it

1115
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,760
and then you pee in front of your boss and you get a pee boner.

1116
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,320
Oh no.

1117
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,480
That was the grossest sentence I've ever said out loud.

1118
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
Yeah, I want to not do this show anymore.

1119
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,560
Can we work that out?

1120
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,920
I'm going to throw out one thing though

1121
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,680
that worries me more than this young man's philosophy

1122
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,920
on how to prepare for a job interview.

1123
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,000
I believe that in this world, there's always a balance.

1124
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,840
And for like every vegetarian,

1125
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,800
there's someone who just eats meat and stuff like that.

1126
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,720
There is someone out there who's like,

1127
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,240
oh no, before an interview,

1128
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,520
I just jerk it until I'm like fall down exhausted.

1129
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,080
Right.

1130
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,320
Like I just nonstop jerk it for like three days

1131
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,280
getting ready for any job interview or sporting event or anything.

1132
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,640
Just know like, I can't stand it anymore.

1133
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,000
I like, I like my hand and my genitals

1134
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,400
to look like I just dropped an iron on them.

1135
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,640
Like just reddened and scalding and peeling away.

1136
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,040
Bill, you look, you look pretty weary.

1137
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,640
Are you sure you're ready for this?

1138
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,960
This big game and or job interview?

1139
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,200
I've never been readier, sir.

1140
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,800
Sir, I'm so sorry.

1141
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,400
I like the cut of that young man's jib.

1142
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,040
It looks like he just furiously masturbated for 72 hours.

1143
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
He's committed to this AutoZone.

1144
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,160
Tantric.

1145
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,680
So that's our, that's our dumb show about Peaboners, I guess,

1146
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,040
is what Griffin has made it about now.

1147
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,880
That's the only thing anybody's going to talk about.

1148
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,080
Thank you so much for tuning in.

1149
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,360
We're here every Monday morning, morning, afternoon, you know, Mondays.

1150
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:55,860
Yeah.

1151
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,140
Usually.

1152
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,400
You can find us at nbmbam.com at nbmbam on Twitter or on Facebook.

Just search for my brother, my brother and me.

1154
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,760
Speaking of Twitter, keep an eye on like Jesse's Twitter account, our Twitter account,

1155
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,080
and I'm sure everybody who's associated with MaxFun.

1156
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,520
We got a new MaxFun show coming up, I believe this week.

1157
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,760
We're really excited about it.

1158
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,560
You're going to love it.

1159
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,120
So just kind of keep your eyes glued to the Twitter.

1160
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,620
Yeah.

1161
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,880
Keep it, keep it locked.

1162
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,840

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,680
if it's to our sampler.

1169
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,200
That's bit.ly forward slash it's what bim bam.

1170
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,400
And I've seen a lot of those this week.

1171
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,280
So thank you guys so much.

1172
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:09,840
Thank you.

1173
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,880
Yeah, much obliged.

1174
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,280
Thank you.

1175
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,640
We don't advertise or anything like that.

1176
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,840
So telling friends is the only way we can evangelize.

1177
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,200
So you doing that for us, it means a whole lot.

1178
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1179
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,720
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1180
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,720
Are they touring?

1181
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,200
I keep seeing tweets of his and he's in different places and I think they might be touring.

1182
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,560
Well, he was doing some shows with our dear friend, John Hodgman.

1183
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,720
They were in Tucson and I think maybe LA at the Largo.

1184
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
Is it possible he's just a rambling man?

1185
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,080
I think that he has the look of a rambler.

1186
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,600
Yeah, yeah.

1187
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,960
So he's just a rambling man.

1188
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,640
Go see him if you have the opportunity.

1189
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,280
I haven't yet, but I bet their shows are great.

1190
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,680
Oh, oh, oh, one more thing before I forget.

1191
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,920
