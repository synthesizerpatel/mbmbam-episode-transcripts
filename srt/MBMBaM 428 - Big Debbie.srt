1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,360
Listen, I know it's early. It just turned October. It just, oh, tick tick tick,

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,560
just rolled over into October, but I know what next year's theme is going to be.

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
Oh, Jesus Christ. At what point do we...

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,480
I haven't collaborated with like even anybody this year, not even one time a little bit.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,800
You've worked with us on several things.

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,520
That doesn't fucking count anymore. We are the same thing at this point.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
We haven't reached across the boundaries to other people to create new art in you

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,040
with the umlaut over it art, and we haven't collaborated.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,120
Let's stop fucking kidding ourselves.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
I collaborated once.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
With whom? On what?

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
My friend Jerry.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,080
On what?

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,280
Sandwich.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,840
You made a sandwich with your friend Jerry. I do actually remember that.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah, it was a sandwich.

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
It was a good one. You shared a little piece of it.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
You mailed me a little finger of it, and you mailed Justin a finger of it,

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
and we had a great meal together over it.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,760
Well, I had a piece of bread with some peanut butter on it,

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000
and Jerry had a piece of bread with some jelly on it,

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
and we kind of high-fived in midair with a piece of bread.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,480
It was good. It was a friendship sandwich.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,640
And we called it a Travis and Jerry sandwich,

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
and then you can find it at most grocery stores called Uncrustables.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,400
But here's the thing. In the past, our themes have been something that we are telling

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
everyone in our audience to do, right?

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,760
They are general messages of, like, guidance for the year.

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
I've got something a little different in mind for 2019.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,320
This is very specific for my brother, my brother, and me,

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,880
and it's going to change our show forever.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,600
Are you ready?

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,320
I guess so.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Like, I have plans, like, later today,

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
and so I'm not sure I'm in the, like, right space to get my life changed.

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,480
Okay.

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,040
Can I-

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you ready?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,080
Sidebar with juice.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
What? Juice?

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah. What are we going to do if it's shitty?

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,560
The theme?

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
Yeah, what if we do if it's shitty?

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,040
Because you're talking about it like it's so good.

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,320
I didn't approve talking about this right now.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,480
Like, this is breaking my heart right now.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
I don't know, what am I-

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
Like, it's so early.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,560
It's so early.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Are you ready?

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
Okay, 20 equine teen.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
This year, we buy a horse.

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
I love it.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,960
You got to hear the rest of the idea too.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,880
Yes, Ann has a cousin named I love it butt.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,720
We buy the horse, and we set up a 24-7 webcam on the horse

65
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,000
so that people can go and look at the horse whenever they want to.

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
All right, seven issues.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,920
One.

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
Wow, seven issues.

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,680
Okay, let's go.

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
Yeah, it took me less than seven seconds to generate them.

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
So I'm talking about more than one issue per sec.

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,160
But if we have a 24-7 webcam up on the horse,

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
people are going to see how bad we are at taking care of this fucking horse.

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
Are you kidding me?

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
We will keep it somewhere where there are people competent to take care of the horse.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,720
That don't matter.

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,280
That don't matter.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,680
That don't matter.

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
People are going to be watching these feeds for little glimpses of our glory

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,960
as we walk in and we're like, let's pet the horse.

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Let's ride the horse.

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
Let's love the horse.

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Let's nourish the horse with our love.

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,440
And then they're not going to see that because I won't and you fucking won't.

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
And Justin certainly won't.

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,320
I might.

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,040
I might.

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
You won't.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
You wicked won't.

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
If it's nearby.

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Number two, horses are very, very wildly profoundly expensive.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,880
They say that the day you buy a horse is the happiest day of your life.

93
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
And that's it.

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,040
That's all they say.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,760
Because it is a happy thing, but it doesn't change the fact that it's profoundly expensive,

96
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,240
Travie.

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,480
I don't, I feel like there's a real, I've gotten smarter.

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
When you're growing up, you think it's funny to joke about everything.

99
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Everything is a joke.

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
As I've gotten older, I've learned, especially on this show, not everything's funny

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
because we've joked about things sometimes and they happen.

102
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,640
And sometimes they happen in like, I wanted it to happen.

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
So it did Matilda way.

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,480
And some of them happen in like, we try to make this happen without really thinking about

105
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
the repercussions of it way.

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,320
And this seems to be one of those situations where I feel like we could, like someone could

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,760
just show up with a horse.

108
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,520
That's, that's my worry is that the people will say, well, these guys are never going

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,640
to do this on their own.

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm going to just get them a horse.

111
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
Oh, I see.

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,200
You said that's your worry, but that was my hoping outcome.

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,680
I was hoping that someone would buy a horse.

114
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,180
Yeah.

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
I want to buy the horse because I want to own it.

116
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
I don't want a charity horse because a charity horse says, I don't, I can't have this.

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
I gotta tell you, Trav, just to get a taste of this, I did just go on Craigslist to search

118
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,280
for horses in your area or in my area or what's up in my area.

119
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,200
There are some busted ass steeds up on this service, Trav.

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,360
And I know every horse is a treasure from God's blessings, but oh my God, there are

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,200
some steeds on here, Trav, that we would not want to be sort of seen with, let alone the

122
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,960
legal owners of.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
There are some busted-

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
That's what people said about Seabiscuit, Griffin.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,440
No, Trav.

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah, Seabiscuit is a tall glass of water compared to some of these busted, gelding,

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
gentle for the family steeds.

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
That's what this one says.

129
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
Appaloosa gelding gentle for the family.

130
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,920
Not my fucking family, it looks awful.

131
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
Oh my God.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
How pretty does your horse need to be then, Griffin?

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Better than this.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,520
At least better than this.

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,920
This is a good sort of metric.

136
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,600
Here is how incapable we are to own a horse.

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,520
And I'm gonna just, this is a quiz that I don't know the answer to, but I'm gonna hit

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,160
you, Travis.

139
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
This is a quarter horse.

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,600
It's a listing in my region of Huntington West, Virginia.

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,640
This is a nice two-year-old grade quarter horse, standing 13.3 HH.

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,200
What's that mean?

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Hands high.

144
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,320
Hands high.

145
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,880
Okay, fair.

146
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,640
I think it's horse height.

147
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
HH stands for horse height, and it's a special, it's like stone, you know how they say stone

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
across the pond?

149
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,160
A horse height is just like a new unit for horses' heights.

150
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
This is easy go, okay.

151
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Simple to catch, in your pocket kind of horse.

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,760
Easy going, stands tied.

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Trav, easy going, stands tied.

154
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
You can tie it up, it'll just hang out.

155
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
Picks up all four hooves and has a nice solid WTC.

156
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Walk, trot, canter.

157
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
Oh, that's good.

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Okay, I'll give that to you.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,840
Been ponied on several different occasions.

160
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
I think it means it got drunk on pony wine.

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
No silly business to him.

162
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
Has never offered to buck, bite, kick, or rear.

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,160
Do they offer?

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Hi, I don't mind if you'd like to buck or bite or kick or rear.

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
Can be stalled or turned out on pasture.

166
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Does great either way.

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,760
Ready to be started your way.

168
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
I love it, right?

169
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
I can see this guy going any direction.

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
He's a nice horse to work with and a pleasure to be around.

171
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,480
Asking 700 OBO.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
Or best offer.

173
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
$700 is not very much for a horse.

174
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,160
Here's what I want to say though.

175
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,880
On Craigslist, the listing does say $1.

176
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,680
So maybe you're lying.

177
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,840
Maybe you're a liar and I can't really trust anything

178
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,880
you say about your horse.

179
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,120
Now, I found a mini horse slash pony nearby Cincinnati.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
A real little Sebastian type.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
And it says here, no kick or bite.

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,560
So that's $200 over offer.

183
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
I do want it to offer it.

184
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
Because sometimes I do.

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
The only time I've ever ridden a horse

186
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,520
is on our old youth minister's farm.

187
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,720
And I was going bareback, no saddle on that bad boy.

188
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
And it looked back at me and it said,

189
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,080
hey, I'd like to buck you off and hurt your wiener very badly.

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,600
And I said, I would not like that.

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,320
Oh, you're doing it.

192
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
You did it.

193
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,360
It's done.

194
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,560
It's been done.

195
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,520
Thank you.

196
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank you.

197
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,240
Let's learn about Jesus now.

198
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
The horse said this?

199
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,400
No.

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
So yeah, Trav, this is-

201
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm going to work on it.

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,280
I'm going to work on it.

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah, it's a non-starter.

204
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm going to work on it.

205
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm going to manifest it with my energy

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
and I'm going to make it happen.

207
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
Juice, how about that first question?

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
Yeah, so this is an advice show.

209
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
My advice to you is probably don't buy a horse.

210
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,080
Unless you know what you're doing and you don't.

211
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,480
You don't.

212
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
You can learn on the spot.

213
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
You don't start driving after you learn to drive.

214
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,280
You can't buy a My First Horse at Burner Horse

215
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,600
and then learn how to not let them die.

216
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
What if I got a super old horse?

217
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
Nah, it's got you there.

218
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
They're harder and they're more racist.

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
So that's not even the kind of horse vibe

220
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
you want around your home.

221
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,400
You want a young, open-minded horse that will offer to bite

222
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
but not so much that it gets weird.

223
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Yeah, it'll make it seem like it wants to know

224
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,080
if you want it to bite you

225
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,400
rather than making it clear that it wants to bite you.

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,360
I would hate to bite you.

227
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,280
My boyfriend recently revealed to me

228
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,680
that he's allergic to beans and has never eaten them.

229
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,360
I don't know what accent that was that you said

230
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
the word beans with.

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
That's why I always say beans.

232
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,280
I always say beans.

233
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,720
My boyfriend recently revealed to me

234
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
he's allergic to beans and has never eaten them.

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
While researching bean free chili recipes,

236
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
he quietly but seriously asked me,

237
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
what do beans taste like?

238
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,520
Brothers, I've tried but I don't have the words

239
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
that I hope and somewhat fear you do.

240
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
How can I describe what a bean tastes like

241
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,400
to someone who's never had them?

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,960
And that's from Beanful Thinker in Oregon.

243
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,280
I can tell you mouthfeel.

244
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,960
What's a mouthfeel of a bean?

245
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Mouthfeel of a bean is a little bit like mushed up,

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
like sand, a little dirt in there.

247
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Gritty.

248
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
Oh, beans.

249
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
Oh, the beans are gritty.

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Yeah, I think the best way I could describe

251
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,280
the mouthfeel of a bean is simply to say

252
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,080
never as creamy as you want.

253
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
You expect it to be a certain amount of creaminess

254
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,000
but it's not gonna get you there.

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
And I always want a little pop to my bean

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
but it more just like.

257
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,400
It gives up, it gives up, it goes to me.

258
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,280
You know how they say small potatoes?

259
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,720
I think a bean is kind of like a small soft potato

260
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
in terms of like.

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
A small soft potato I think is very good.

262
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,440
Yeah, now we are kind of limiting this

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
because I think we're thinking of your standard

264
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,960
black bean, red bean, kidney bean kind of deal.

265
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,720
But this could also be like green beans.

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,960
You're right, Trav.

267
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Let's codify this.

268
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,640
All beans taste the same, save for green beans

269
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,160
which are beans that you eat inside their house

270
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,320
and lima beans which I have been trying to get

271
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,640
the Food and Drug Administration to classify

272
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,800
as poison for my entire life.

273
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
Yes.

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
They are yucky.

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,640
I would happily put the Mr. Yuck sticker

276
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,600
on all these lima beans.

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
They are the fucking worst.

278
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,640
You know, lima beans technically are poison

279
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,600
if you consume enough of them that contain a chemical

280
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
that causes your body to create cyanide.

281
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
Oh, yeah.

282
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
It's like apple seeds.

283
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,080
It's because they're so fucking gross

284
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,040
that your body's like I would actually rather be dead

285
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
than continue to eat these yucky, yucky lima beans.

286
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
I do not care how much butter you put on them, Derek.

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
They're still lima beans and they're gross.

288
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm gonna go ahead and produce a chemical

289
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
to hurt my own body.

290
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,800
Thank you.

291
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Thank you, Derek, for this.

292
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,640
And of course, jelly beans

293
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,760
which tastes like the opposite of beans.

294
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
Why haven't they made bean-flavored jelly beans?

295
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,680
Thank you.

296
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
I bet you somebody has.

297
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
You guys are also very limited in the...

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,960
I would suggest to you to get into a bean-based diet

299
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,440
because you would be shocked at how many different

300
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,520
permutations of beans there can be.

301
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,440
Like my famous black bean brownies.

302
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
That's gonna give you a whole different appreciation

303
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
for beans when you're using beans as the brownie batter.

304
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,120
Another one would be roasting the beans

305
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
in very hot temperatures.

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
Turns into something of a crunchy snack.

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
Kind of like pop beans.

308
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,200
Kind of like pop beans, bean chips.

309
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Now, Justin, is this good advice for someone

310
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
who is definitely allergic?

311
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
I sat on my beans and made them bean chips.

312
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
I sat on my beans.

313
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
I sat on my beans and made them bean chips.

314
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
But our question asker...

315
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Okay, very allergic to beans.

316
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,200
I sat on my beans.

317
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
But listen, Trav.

318
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
I sat on my beans.

319
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
He sat right on his beans, dude.

320
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,480
I sat on my beans.

321
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
No, I was gonna enjoy these beans

322
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,280
and I sat on them.

323
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,320
This is a good question.

324
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
Is your boyfriend allergic through skin contact?

325
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Can your boyfriend touch beans?

326
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Because then maybe if he touches enough beans,

327
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
he'll get the feel for the beans

328
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
and then he can guess what they taste like from the feel.

329
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah, goosh it up in your hand.

330
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,240
Goosh up a bunch of beans in your hand.

331
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Imagine it's your mouth.

332
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,080
Yeah, with your teeth.

333
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
But the teeth are your fingers.

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
You can't be allergic to beans.

335
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
What?

336
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,560
I don't think you could be allergic to beans.

337
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
You can't be allergic to anything.

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,000
I faked a Windex allergy when I worked at Blockbuster

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
so I wouldn't have to clean.

340
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,040
And I don't think you could be allergic to beans.

341
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
Wait, hold on.

342
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,200
So to connect the two things you just said,

343
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,680
based on the fact that you lied about being allergic

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
to something once,

345
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
you think it is impossible to then be allergic to beans?

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,760
No, it is, of course, I'm being silly.

347
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,520
It's because they're in the same family as peanuts.

348
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
So of course you can be allergic to beans.

349
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
But thank you for finally clarifying for us

350
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
when you are and aren't being silly on the show.

351
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm just having a lot of fun.

352
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,760
If it sounds like I'm having a hoot and a holler,

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
just the best darn time of my life,

354
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,440
then I'm probably joking around just having some fun

355
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,240
with the listeners.

356
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
The listeners and I get it.

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,720
It's kind of a private thing.

358
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,320
How about a Yahoo?

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,960
Okay.

360
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,840
This one was sent in by so many fucking people, it's wild.

361
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Thank you, everybody.

362
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,120
It's Yahoo Answers user, Parker.

363
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Parker, who asks,

364
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
are goldfish the snack cursed?

365
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
On the first day of one of my classes,

366
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,040
I was sat in the very front row

367
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,000
and I had a bag of goldfish open for me to snack on.

368
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
When reaching for a pencil, I nudged the bag

369
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
and it swept the crunchy fish across the table

370
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
and some onto the floor.

371
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
Three weeks later, I purchased another bag of goldfish

372
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
and while struggling to remove my sweater,

373
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
I knocked them to the floor

374
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,720
after only a handful have been eaten.

375
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,200
Suggestions?

376
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,760
Huh.

377
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,960
I have spilled two bags of goldfish crackers.

378
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm starting to think these things are all cursed.

379
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm starting to think that there was a murder.

380
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,000
Somebody fell into the goldfish crunchitizer

381
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
at the goldfish factory

382
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
and then their angry ghost is going around

383
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,760
and making all the bags fucking fall over.

384
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,680
They are incredibly spillable snack.

385
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
I mean, of the snacks, they're incredibly spillable

386
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,960
because goldfish are one of the very few snacks

387
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
and really, you won't be able to think of any of them,

388
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,440
I think, that aren't like Pepperidge Farm-based,

389
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,840
but they're a bag with a flat bottom.

390
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,960
Oh, that's just tempting fate if you think about it.

391
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,640
You set that bag up and you're like,

392
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,800
that's fine, it's flat on the bottom,

393
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,760
but you wouldn't do that with fucking any other bag.

394
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,680
You would not set any other bag up and be like,

395
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
hey bag, are you cool?

396
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,800
And expect that bag to be cool.

397
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,360
The goldfish lure you into this false sense of security

398
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,400
like, hey, we know there's a thousand of us

399
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
and we're in a bag, but it'll be fine.

400
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Just walk away, it's fine.

401
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,680
Sometimes they come in a milk carton too

402
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,960
and that's just trickery.

403
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,040
That's just roguish trickery

404
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,760
because I'm going to see that on the shelf in the pantry

405
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,320
and I'm going to think,

406
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,120
Dylan left the milk out in the pantry again,

407
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,040
why doesn't he get where this actually goes?

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
And then I'm so busy yelling at Dylan,

409
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
I haven't even realized the mistake that I've made,

410
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
which is that they're cheesy crackers and not milk.

411
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
Do you think it's the ghost of goldfish?

412
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,560
Interesting, every time you crunch one of them,

413
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,680
a little ghost comes out

414
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,520
and either tries to push over its bag,

415
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
but there's just one of them.

416
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
So really, I think by the laws of physics,

417
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
you have to have eaten half the bag

418
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,920
and then you'll have half a bag worth of goldfish ghosts

419
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,840
who are then capable of knocking over their partners

420
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
who are still remaining, still living inside the bag.

421
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,880
There was one day many years ago at Pepperidge Farm

422
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
where a well-meaning chef said,

423
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,800
hi, everyone, I've made new cheese crackers

424
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,240
and I'd like everyone to enjoy them.

425
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,880
They're small and I think you're really gonna like them.

426
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
And the guy everybody at the office hates,

427
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
whose name is Billup.

428
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
Billup tries one and he's like,

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,280
mm, close, but I think I'd like them more

430
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
if they're shaped like an animal.

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
They're like, huh, what kind?

432
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
What kind?

433
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,880
A pet, like a pet that people have, that everybody has.

434
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
I wish they were shaped like pets that we have,

435
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,920
the goldfish pets.

436
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
Well, why do you wanna eat?

437
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,240
I just don't know.

438
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,360
I just think I'd like it better

439
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
if they're shaped like one of my pets

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
and I could eat a bunch of them

441
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
in front of my goldfish that I have,

442
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
my real animal goldfish.

443
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,700
Why?

444
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
We put them in a tiny prison, give them dirt,

445
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,920
and also watch me eat crackers of you

446
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,600
for your entire life.

447
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,680
I watched a David Blaine magic trick

448
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
where he did eat three goldfish

449
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
and then he did throw them all up

450
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
and everybody at the party,

451
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
like Jake Gyllenhaal, freaked the fuck out.

452
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
And I saw that and I said, I would like to do that,

453
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
but I wanna keep them down.

454
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,800
And I also wanna be made out of cheesy cracker stuff

455
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,840
because that's my shit.

456
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
My boyfriend and I recently moved to do a house.

457
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
While mowing the lawn,

458
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
my boyfriend was apparently enjoying his time in the sun

459
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,280
and decided on a whim to mow the neighbor's front lawn as well.

460
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Well, hmm, we have met our neighbors briefly

461
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
and shared neighborly conversation,

462
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
but we really don't know each other.

463
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
He didn't say anything to them about mowing their lawn

464
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
and just thought of it as a nice thing to do.

465
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm worried that our neighbors will be confused at best

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
and worse interpret this as a passive aggressive comment

467
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,880
on their lawn care.

468
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,040
It was, should we knock on the door?

469
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,640
Okay, it doesn't say that.

470
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,480
That's Justin's commentary.

471
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah, should we knock on the door

472
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,640
and explain that we're not weird?

473
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
That's from Sybil and Cincy.

474
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
Let me explain my comment.

475
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
What I'm saying is you looked at their lawn

476
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,240
and said, that's long enough.

477
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
Somebody should gut it.

478
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,100
Yeah.

479
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,800
I mean, it's good that your partner Gleeb Glow

480
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,720
from the planet Mars 8.

481
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
What is he doing?

482
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,800
What are you doing?

483
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,640
I'd like to mow two lawns.

484
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
What are you doing?

485
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,160
The only way I think that you can get away with this

486
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,800
is to have your boyfriend knock on their door

487
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,240
and request $10 for having mowed their lawn

488
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
and then they refuse and he goes like,

489
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,680
well, I never or whatever.

490
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,040
And then he walks away

491
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,400
because if someone was just like,

492
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,160
hey, just letting you know I mowed your lawn,

493
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,280
I would assume some kind of intent

494
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
that was about judging me or something.

495
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
But if they said like, I did it

496
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
and now I expect to be paid,

497
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I'd be like, oh, I understand this.

498
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,920
I get what this transaction is.

499
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
What would you do if they came home

500
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
and you were in the yard, in their yard,

501
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,320
mowing their grass with your machine

502
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,520
at your height of grass that you like it cut

503
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
with your dirty machine?

504
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
What if they have special seed?

505
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,680
What if they have special grass?

506
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
Hey, here's one.

507
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
What if they like to cut their grass?

508
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,880
That's it.

509
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,680
What if one of them is Gleeb Glow from Mars 8 also

510
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,720
and they want to mow at least one lawn this month?

511
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
They love mowing their lawn

512
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
and you stole that from them.

513
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,560
What if it's the last good mow of the year?

514
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,640
And you've been saving up that last glass of lemonade?

515
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,560
You're good mowing shorts.

516
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,080
What if, what if they can't mow the lawn

517
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,560
because their children got shrunk down?

518
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh no!

519
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
You asshole!

520
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,160
You asshole killed their freaking little kids.

521
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,680
You mowed their little kids.

522
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
You mowed all their little, little kids,

523
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,720
their little, little teenage kids

524
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
that shrunk down accidentally.

525
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
What did you think it was?

526
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,120
A gnoll?

527
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Some sort of chipmunk?

528
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
No, that was their children.

529
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,360
How small are the children that they're about chipmunk size

530
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,560
when you're like, nah, this is fine.

531
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,000
The grass is so tall.

532
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
They have no chance.

533
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,800
Oh no, I ran over their Legos.

534
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,720
I ran over their oatmeal cream pie.

535
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
Hey squad, you know that scene

536
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
in Honey I Shrunk the Kids

537
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,560
where they're with the aunt

538
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
and they're surviving out in the backyard

539
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,320
and they come across an oatmeal cream pie

540
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
and all start having a big snack of it?

541
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,760
Yeah.

542
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,200
Why the fuck was there a whole oatmeal cream pie?

543
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,200
Whole oatmeal cream pie just sitting out in their backyard?

544
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,840
Who is walking around in their backyard

545
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
trying to go from point A to point B

546
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
with their snack on oatmeal cream pie,

547
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,240
which was normal size to them, a big teenager,

548
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
and then they dropped it and they were like,

549
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
nah, that's just gonna stay right there on the ground.

550
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,520
It's such a good question.

551
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
They're so good.

552
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,280
What kind of dirtbag is like,

553
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,800
that's fucking fine, I love ants and I hate snacks.

554
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,520
Just leave it.

555
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,040
What am I gonna do, pick it up?

556
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,920
Come on.

557
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,000
Come on, with these ants?

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
With these beautiful manicures?

559
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,120
No way, leave it.

560
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm on my way inside.

561
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm Matt Brewer and I'm a dirtbag

562
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
and I'm gonna leave that exactly where I dropped it.

563
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Who's playing with Legos outside?

564
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,640
You know, at least one of those kids

565
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
had to keep using the laser machine

566
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
to shrink themselves down and eat big oatmeal cream.

567
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
That's the fucking best.

568
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
I don't wanna get squashed or mowed down

569
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
and I obviously gotta go to school

570
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,240
and I can't be one inch high while I'm doing that shit.

571
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
But guys, I gotta tell you,

572
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,080
I do miss the big oatmeal cream pie days.

573
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
Do you remember the big oatmeal cream pie times?

574
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
We almost got killed by a scorpion or whatever,

575
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
but the big oatmeal cream pie

576
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,040
was the best moment of my life, I think.

577
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,440
I did very much enjoy the huge oatmeal cream pie.

578
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,000
It's just, I don't, I don't, okay.

579
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
The number one thing that is wild

580
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
about the oatmeal cream pie is,

581
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
I dropped an oatmeal cream pie outside,

582
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm just gonna leave it all well, then it's the breaks.

583
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,280
That's wild.

584
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,280
The other thing that's wild is

585
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,080
that's the first ant that found it.

586
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,160
The ant they befriend is the first ant

587
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
to find this fucking thing.

588
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
Are you kidding me?

589
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,000
If I leave one chunk of apple,

590
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
which is gross compared to an oatmeal cream pie.

591
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
It's, oh God, disgusting comparison.

592
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,800
Covered, covered in ants.

593
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,480
Five seconds later, covered in ants.

594
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,120
You tell me this thing isn't getting wrecked by ants?

595
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,600
No way.

596
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm leaving this as a plot hole on the IMDB page.

597
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
Let's fucking trash this flick.

598
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,280
Yeah.

599
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
Hey, how come in honey we shrunk ourselves

600
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,320
where the parents got themselves shrunk down

601
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
and the parents find them,

602
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,720
the kids aren't like, I'm gonna grow you back,

603
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
but hold up, y'all have got to eat

604
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
one of these oatmeal cream pies

605
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,120
and go down the kitchen and give their little parents

606
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
a big oatmeal cream pies.

607
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
Like, that seems fucked up.

608
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,080
How come by the third movie,

609
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,760
the Zelenskys aren't like fucking super rich?

610
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
Cause like Wayne could just like

611
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,920
make an oatmeal cream pie really big

612
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,760
and be like, hey, everybody in town,

613
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,800
you can stay normal size, but come fucking feast

614
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
on this oatmeal cream pie.

615
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,840
I've fixed starvation forever.

616
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,400
Yeah.

617
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,040
Anyway, I'd love to eat that oatmeal cream pie.

618
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,240
I want a fucking oatmeal cream pie.

619
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
God, fuck that makes me so angry.

620
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll never get to have that.

621
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
Pay any cards.

622
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
I'm gonna make a company called Big Debbie

623
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,560
and it only makes big snacks.

624
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
For big boys.

625
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,800
For big boys, for big boys.

626
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,160
Hi, I'm Big Debbie and I'm ready to blast

627
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,600
your big ass hunger.

628
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,120
Oatmeal cream pies the size of a whole fucking pie.

629
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's do this.

630
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
Open up, motherfucker.

631
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,920
These are my jacked zebra cakes full of protein

632
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,120
for big boys.

633
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
And the fucking, the mascot's just a ripped

634
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
fucking zebra, just jacked muscles.

635
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
Come on, big boys.

636
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Are you gonna eat this star crunch asshole

637
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,920
or you want to drink some unsweetened tea?

638
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
It's October, motherfuckers.

639
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,240
Have one of our weird pumpkin shaped things.

640
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,880
This time it's a whole fucking pumpkin

641
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
full of protein powder.

642
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
Come on, coward.

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm here to fuck you up.

644
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
Did I make it protein?

645
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
They've all got fucking protein now.

646
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,000
Hell yeah.

647
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,840
Get swole.

648
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,760
Get swole with me, Big Debbie.

649
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,080
But please continue to patronize my granddaughter,

650
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,360
Little Debbie.

651
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
I care about her and I'm so proud of her small business.

652
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,160
Can you imagine being at a business meeting

653
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,960
with Little Debbie?

654
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
That'd be wild.

655
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,920
So cute.

656
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,400
I think it'd go a little something like this.

657
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,080
You think if you have a business meeting

658
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
at Little Debbie Co.

659
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
I love Little Debbie.

660
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
I know the family of Little Debbie

661
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,720
is a listener to the show and thank you so much.

662
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,840
I appreciate you.

663
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
Because they've sent us some Little Debbie's before.

664
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,120
If you have, they sent me some Little Debbie's for everyone.

665
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
If you have a business meeting at Little Debbie,

666
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
do you have to serve Little Debbie's

667
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,680
at the business meeting?

668
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,200
Because one, yes.

669
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
I will take a meeting at Little Debbie

670
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,320
if those are the conditions of the gathering.

671
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,760
Second, there's some times where maybe it's not appropriate.

672
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
Maybe it's not appropriate to have a big plate

673
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,760
full of zebra bars or star crunches

674
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,240
or Christmas tree cakes.

675
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
Although those are my fucking shit though.

676
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,480
Oh really?

677
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,400
I love the Swiss cake rolls.

678
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,760
I like the shortcake rolls.

679
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,280
I like my food in a roll form.

680
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,040
This is a fun universe that Justin's invented though

681
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,400
where at the McDonald's corporate headquarters

682
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,840
they're talking about how they've seen just more

683
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
and more of their profits be wicked away by Chipotle

684
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
and this could be the end of Ronald this year.

685
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,920
And then they come in and they do have a bunch

686
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,080
of their nasty burgers and chicken nuggets

687
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,040
and when they say, I'm worth 30 million dollars

688
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,160
but I guess we do have to eat our dirty chicken balls.

689
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,040
If you have a picnic, you can't just get subs.

690
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,400
That's what I'm saying.

691
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
If you have a McDonald's corporate picnic,

692
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
you can't just like, you know what I love this time?

693
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
Pizza.

694
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
No, absolutely not.

695
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
Well, this is McDonald's pizza.

696
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,600
Don't tease me with the McPizza, please.

697
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,680
Can we please go to the money zone?

698
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm there already.

699
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
Look around you.

700
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,800
I have changed the walls in every direction

701
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,600
that you're not looking until finally you spin wildly

702
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
and notice that you've been in the money zone for hours.

703
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Our first sponsor this week is Stamps.com.

704
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,160
You can get everything you want on demand.

705
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,120
Podcasts, Little Debbie's, that's if you work there, of course.

706
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,880
I don't think you can get Little Debbie's on demand

707
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,400
if you work at Little Debbie, Justin.

708
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,040
Stop punching me, motherfucker!

709
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,840
Not any Little Debbie.

710
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
It comes through pneumatic tubes.

711
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,200
You pull a lever and one blasts out of a pneumatic tube

712
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,880
into your mouth and you take whatever you get

713
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,560
and you love it because they're all great.

714
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,440
Except peanut butter bars, I'm not crazy about that.

715
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,160
Whoa!

716
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,040
You can get postage on demand

717
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,320
and then mail the Little Debbie home to your family,

718
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
but that is a violation of company policy

719
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,160
and you will be terminated if caught.

720
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,760
With Stamps.com, you can access all the amazing services

721
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,360
of the post office except for looking at wanted posters

722
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,880
because they don't do that anymore.

723
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,280
And I asked.

724
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,920
You could buy and print official US postage for any letter,

725
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,120
any package using your own computer and printer

726
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
and the mail carrier picks it up,

727
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,840
which seems like a feature until you realize

728
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,320
they come to your house every day and it would be wild

729
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,720
if they weren't like, I'll take this.

730
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,040
It's nice, it's a nice feature, but just like mail is nice.

731
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,720
Right now, you can use My Brother, all one word,

732
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
for this special offer.

733
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
It's a code, My Brother, for this special offer.

734
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,680
It includes up to $55 of free postage,

735
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,960
a digital scale and a four week trial, so don't wait.

736
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else,

737
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,040
click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage

738
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
and type My Brother.

739
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,320
That's Stamps.com, click the microphone

740
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,560
and then enter My Brother.

741
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,480
Boy, I just don't ever wanna say enter My Brother.

742
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
If I could just avoid that exact phrasing,

743
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,880
it would be great, thank you.

744
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Do you think that right now there is like an executive

745
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
from Stamps.com calling little Debbie and like,

746
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,920
hey, could you pay for part of this ad that we did?

747
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,520
Cause a lot of it was about you and you could just kick in

748
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,160
like 20, 30%, that would be great.

749
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,120
That'd be awesome.

750
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,240
Hey, I wanna tell you about Quip.

751
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
Quip is great, they make really great toothbrushes.

752
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,240
I recently picked one up a couple months ago

753
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,080
and have been brushing with it and it's so nice.

754
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,400
I really like traveling with it.

755
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,520
I think we've talked about this before,

756
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,440
it's got this like case that you can stick onto your mirror

757
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,360
and you can pop it off at any time.

758
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
I thought like because you could stick it on and pop it off,

759
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,800
like it wouldn't stick after a while,

760
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,960
but it just keeps sticking and it's amazing.

761
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,240
But then you can take that case

762
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
and just like put the toothbrush inside it

763
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
and it's an easy travel case, it's awesome.

764
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
Their Sonic Vibrations are designed to be gentle enough

765
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,880
for sensitive gums and Quip toothbrushes run

766
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
for three months on one charge.

767
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,120
Also, brush heads are automatically delivered

768
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,520
on a dentist recommended schedule every three months

769
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,880
for just five bucks.

770
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
So you can get the brush that is backed

771
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,480
by over 20,000 dental professionals.

772
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
Quip starts at just $25.

773
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,680
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

774
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680

That's your first refill pack free at G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com

777
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
slash my brother.

778
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,680
I have a Jumbotron and it's from Anna

779
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,840
and it's for Alex Slater.

780
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Sweetest greetings to my best friend ever.

781
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,240
Our traveling shenanigans have evolved from getting lost

782
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,760
on our way to see Star Trek

783
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
to unforgettable cross country road trips.

784
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Here's to a lifetime of great stories

785
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,680
and adventures to come.

786
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm so proud of the beautiful scarlet haired warrior woman

787
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,840
you will always be.

788
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,880
Love you.

789
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,320
That's nice.

790
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,120
What's wrong Griffin?

791
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm just more of a Star Wars guy, I guess.

792
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
I hate, I love Star Wars so much

793
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,520
with all of the cool lightsabers.

794
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,920
And you're really one of the architects of that world.

795
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm one of the architects, yeah.

796
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
So when they jump you in, George says,

797
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,640
he says, no more Star Trek, okay, boy.

798
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,920
And I said, okay, dad.

799
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,200
Justin, you wanna read the next one?

800
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,920
It would be my great honor.

801
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,040
This is a message for Claire or V and Fiona or Janice or Yannis.

802
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,760
Probably Janice.

803
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,120
It's Janice.

804
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,760
Or Janice.

805
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,560
It's from Emily, your DM and best friend.

806
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,360
Thank you both so much for playing D&D with me,

807
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
for partying with me in the center

808
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,720
of one of the most niche Venn diagrams ever

809
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
and for the incredible friendship we share

810
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,160
that's helped me through the past few

811
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,080
whack tumultuous years of my life.

812
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
2015 may be over, oops.

813
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,080
But I'm so glad that the three of us

814
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,960
are still together enjoying the long, long grift.

815
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,680
I love you.

816
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,200
Now, Justin, I'm-

817
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
Okay, I understand.

818
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
I understand what happened.

819
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,040
We've done bad before,

820
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,840
but I don't think we've done three and a half years bad before.

821
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
I understand what happened now.

822
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

823
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,320
So far, the world's most boring wrestling podcast

824
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,480
has been destroying the competition.

825
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,240
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

826
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
Wait, could it be?

827
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,760
It's Tights and Fights, the perfect wrestling podcast.

828
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,960
Tights and Fights is here to save us

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

830
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
with hilarious conversations.

831
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,480
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

832
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,000
And joke about the finer points of people wearing spandex.

833
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
What a match!

834
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,880
And the Tights and Fights podcast will be back every week.

835
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Thursdays on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

836
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Please, these hosts have families.

837
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,720
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

838
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,820
Sure.

839
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,520
This one was sent in by Michelle Smith.

840
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,080
Thank you, Michelle.

841
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,600
It's Yahoo Answers user Andrew.

842
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,120
It's Jermaine to what we were talking about earlier.

843
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,440
Andrew asks, which do you like better horses or camels?

844
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,320
Keep in mind while we talk about this

845
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,160
that horses are completely over

846
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,760
and we need something like a new joke, I guess.

847
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,760
Andrew says, the reason why I like camels more than horses

848
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,360
is because if one treats it right,

849
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,400
one is actually safer around a camel than a horse.

850
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Camels are smarter than horses.

851
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,480
It is better than horses at perceiving threats.

852
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,400
The trade-off is that the camel is more powerful animal

853
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
and it's bigger and harder to mount to ride

854
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,600
and likes to mess with and try to eat hair.

855
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
And it won't be around you if you mistreat it just one time.

856
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,440
And then the camel will be a dangerous animal to be around.

857
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
But compared to being kicked by a horse,

858
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
it's not that bad of trade-off.

859
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,920
The camel also has a way more efficient stride.

860
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,700
Okay.

861
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Okay, but also camels are harder to sit on?

862
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,380
That depends because I bet you could find a groove

863
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,820
that perfectly matches your grundle.

864
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,940
Do you know what I mean?

865
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,500
Jellybean?

866
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,540
There's a perfect, there's a perfect,

867
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,820
horses are all cookie cutter

868
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,020
except for some of these fucking awful, awful horses

869
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,660
I found on Craigslist, just these little mutants.

870
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,740
But there's probably, you know, no two camels are the same.

871
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,980
And so there's probably one out there

872
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,780
that like if a tailor perfectly measured my googer,

873
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,220
then it could find a camel that perfectly matched

874
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,380
the dimensions of said googer.

875
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,620
Like how a wand chooses the wizard in Harry Potter.

876
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,820
It's exactly like that.

877
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,460
I want to go to Ollivander's Googer Measuring Camel Provider

878
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,220
outfitter and what's wrong, Juice?

879
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,980
They sell cigarettes to kids and horses are beautiful

880
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,820
and there's not any comparison.

881
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,260
They're lucky they have four legs

882
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,860
because otherwise people would never mention them

883
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
in same breath as horses.

884
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,180
Well, I guess we know where Justin stands.

885
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,300
Here's two words for you.

886
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,660
Equine.

887
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,860
Here's another word, dromedary.

888
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,220
The second one sounds like a fart of words

889
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,940
and the equine sounds like a loot player

890
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,940
took a unicorn hair and plucked the finest note.

891
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,500
Possible is what equine sounds like.

892
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,820
And I think, yeah, no thanks.

893
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,140
All right, asked and answered.

894
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,100
Next question.

895
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,580
Got them.

896
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,780
We got them.

897
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,900
I have a quick...

898
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,300
I've been wanting to develop a segment

899
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,980
that's sort of like Munch Squad Jr.

900
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,500
Where I don't necessarily do the song

901
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,460
and interrupt the show,

902
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
but I just mentioned some headlines.

903
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,180
Some quick headlines.

904
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,660
And I just wanted to mention this quick headline.

905
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,780
This is, so this is...

906
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
Munch Squad Jr.

907
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,420
Oh, yeah.

908
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,820
Okay.

909
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,420
So here's, there's a new,

910
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,700
there's a salad chain that's on the cusp of just blowing up.

911
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,940
Can you make a sound effect of you skateboarding up?

912
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,060
Like, I don't know what that sounds like,

913
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,700
but you skateboarding up for Munch Squad Jr.

914
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:13,940
Okay.

915
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,660
Munch Squad Jr.

916
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,420
Don't skateboard away.

917
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,380
Come back.

918
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,420
Munch Squad Jr.

919
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,820
Oh, no, he left.

920
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,020
Oh, I liked him.

921
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm back.

922
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,060
Oh, yeah.

923
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,500
Now you have to do it all in that voice.

924
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,740
Okay.

925
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,340
Now tell me the good, tell me the good news.

926
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,900
I just, it's just one thing I wanted to let you all know.

927
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,100
There's an Oklahoma-based salad chain.

928
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,380
It's blowing up.

929
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,020
They got Robert Lee at the helm, CEO.

930
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,780
Just made a new leadership hire.

931
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,820
It's Todd Madlener.

932
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,540
He's gonna be the veep of operations.

933
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,420
Coming over from Red Robin after 20 years.

934
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,380
And the name of this chain is Cool Greens.

935
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,100
And it's one word and it doesn't sound real,

936
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,540
but it's Cool Greens.

937
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,820
And Todd says,

938
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,260
I am very excited about the opportunity with Cool Greens

939
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,980
and get back into an underserved segment

940
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,420
of fast casual dining.

941
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,820
The salad segment, says Madlener.

942
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,380
There are burger and pizza joints at every corner

943
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,540
while the salad and healthy concepts

944
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,060
are underserved in the US.

945
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,580
I wonder why, Todd.

946
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,660
Cool Greens gives me a chance to get back into the segment

947
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,380
and offer something different to franchisees

948
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,180
looking to diversify their business portfolio

949
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,780
or wanna join the growing, healthy, fast casual segment.

950
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,260
And that restaurant again is called Cool Greens.

951
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,540
Cool, cool, Cool Greens.

952
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
I just Cool Greens.

953
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,620
There's no way, bud.

954
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,460
The only way that Greens become cool as a brand

955
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,820
is if you sold salads

956
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,900
that did have tokens for Chuck E Cheese arcade games

957
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,300
scattered like that was the time.

958
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,620
It was croutons and some feta

959
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,900
and a little bit of cranberry

960
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,220
and tokens that you could use to play arcade games

961
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,420
at Davin Buster's.

962
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,500
Here's your salad.

963
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,140
It's got, we've got croutons and we've got raisins

964
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,260
and we've got fresh Prince of Bel-Air trading cards

965
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,340
and they're right in there.

966
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,260
Shredded right up.

967
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,060
We got baby spinach.

968
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,900
We've got little chunks of fresh Granny Smith apple

969
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,020
and little codes for Fortnite skins.

970
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,500
Kids, come on into Cool Greens.

971
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,540
We know where to buy drugs.

972
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,020
Some day, historians will look back on this bit

973
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,020
and note how easily we could summon up things that are cool

974
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,420
and how hard we stumbled and fought

975
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,100
to come up with salad ingredients.

976
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,300
I did hear raisins in there, I think.

977
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,020
Raisins, it's a thing, but it's like not.

978
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,820
You can do raisins, yeah.

979
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,980
If the bit is like salad things,

980
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,020
there is a list of about a hundred different things.

981
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,060
Yeah, sure.

982
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,580
No, don't get me wrong.

983
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,540
No, don't get me wrong.

984
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,700
Raisins is not a salad thing,

985
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,940
but I wouldn't put it in the top 10.

986
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,500
We could have had carrots or cucumbers or tomatoes,

987
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,340
but we went with raisins.

988
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,060
Survey says, oh, didn't make it on the board.

989
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:32,500
This salad's got scrambled eggs and hot dog slices

990
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
and cool pictures of Spider-Man.

991
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,620
How about another question though?

992
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,580
Yeah, I'd love that.

993
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,900
Now I'm looking at all these salads

994
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,580
and getting hungry for salad.

995
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,620
You know how it goes for people like me.

996
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,500
I work at a toy store that sells...

997
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,420
That was a weird way of saying toy store.

998
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,900
I work at a toy store that sells a variety of objects,

999
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,420
including small colorful rocks and gems.

1000
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,340
The other day, an older man came up to me

1001
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,660
in the store with a panic look in his eyes.

1002
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,060
He ran up to me, dropped a giant wad of cash on the table

1003
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,820
and said, I have $150, how many rocks can I get?

1004
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,500
Due to this totaling out to a substantial amount of rocks,

1005
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,220
I had to grab my manager to help with the transaction.

1006
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,900
But when I came back, he was gone.

1007
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,420
If he comes back, what should I do in this situation?

1008
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,180
Why does he need so many rocks?

1009
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,260
I'm deeply concerned about the situation, brothers,

1010
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,540
and I really need some clarity.

1011
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,940
Yeah, that's from ill-fated encounter in Idaho.

1012
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,140
And it is for a slingshot fight.

1013
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,460
Oh, I was going to say time traveler.

1014
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,940
Time traveler does need rocks for the future.

1015
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,900
We've run out of rocks.

1016
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,180
Mars needs rocks.

1017
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,220
Mars needs rocks.

1018
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
And we did too many slingshot fights.

1019
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,340
We ran out, shot them all up, and they got out into space.

1020
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,380
And why do you need so many rocks?

1021
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,140
$150 worth of rocks is probably a lot of rocks, eh?

1022
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,260
A great deal of rocks.

1023
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,420
Maybe not like at a toy store.

1024
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,820
You could probably get a better sort of rock per dollar

1025
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,340
at a Home Depot or like the old quarry.

1026
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,540
Fuck that.

1027
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,300
At the quarry, you don't even need $150.

1028
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,900
Just go and take some rocks, bud.

1029
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,620
But those aren't prestige rocks, Griffin.

1030
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,700
Those are just dirty rocks.

1031
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,340
There has to be something about how prestigious these rocks are.

1032
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,340
The only thing I can imagine is this old man was at a party

1033
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,260
and said, I bet you all I have $150 worth of rocks.

1034
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,740
And they said, no way, Gene.

1035
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,300
And then he was like, I'll be right back.

1036
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,220
Because he was hoisting his own petard.

1037
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,300
You're suggesting he's been maybe turned away

1038
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,860
from every other rock store in the county

1039
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,140
and found out that they do have rocks at the toy store.

1040
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,500
They've blocked him at the quarry.

1041
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,260
They've blocked him at the Home Depot.

1042
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,220
And this is it for me.

1043
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,140
If you can't help me out, nobody can.

1044
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,940
The way I understand this question is that the old man

1045
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,700
left without buying the rocks.

1046
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Is that how you all understand this question

1047
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,420
to have happened?

1048
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,860
Yes.

1049
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,820
That's terrible.

1050
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,820
That's a terrible thing.

1051
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,500
That's so many rocks.

1052
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,420
This person says, how should I handle

1053
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,860
this situation in the future?

1054
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,060
If this old man comes back, you should throw those rocks at him

1055
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,620
and say, hey, jerk wad.

1056
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,260
They don't pay me enough to haul these rocks around the store.

1057
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,820
I'm not a big buff rock hauling guy.

1058
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,300
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1059
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:25,860
They might be.

1060
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,980
OK.

1061
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,860
They might be big and jacked and crazy strong.

1062
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,900
Like big Debbie.

1063
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,860
Oh, my God.

1064
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,300
What if the old man's bet was, I bet that that clerk

1065
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,860
can carry $150 worth of rocks and gems.

1066
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,820
Ah, that old bar bet.

1067
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,540
The oldest one in the book.

1068
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,820
I bet that person can carry $150 worth of gems and rocks.

1069
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
The only thing I can assume is that this person,

1070
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,420
this old man, needed these rocks for some nefarious purpose.

1071
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,860
Otherwise, when you said I have to go get my manager,

1072
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,500
then old man must have thought like, ah, the jig is up

1073
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,580
and like run out of the store.

1074
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,460
Oh, they probably robbed you.

1075
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,660
Oh, yeah, right.

1076
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,940
OK, they robbed you.

1077
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,940
I need to buy $150 worth of rocks.

1078
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,780
Can you run a quick calculation?

1079
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,060
Oh, you got to talk to your manager?

1080
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,420
Yeah, go ahead and head to the back room.

1081
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,060
I'll wait.

1082
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,780
Smash, grab, loot, loot, loot, steal, steal, steal, take, take,

1083
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,900
take, mine, mine, mine.

1084
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,380
Bye bye.

1085
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,940
What do you think old man Gene took, Griffin?

1086
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,700
Hundreds of dollars?

1087
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,660
Why are you suggesting?

1088
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,060
Because he's aged?

1089
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,060
He stole a bunch of checkers sets, Trav.

1090
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,340
No, he took cold hard cash, bud.

1091
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
I was just going to say maybe he took some rocks.

1092
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,300
I didn't realize what you were talking about.

1093
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,980
He did steal some rocks on the side.

1094
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,380
He said, now that I've said that, I know it was a ruse,

1095
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,700
but I would actually like some cool rocks.

1096
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,700
I do like rocks.

1097
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,380
I do like rocks.

1098
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,060
My nephew loves rocks.

1099
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,820
My nephew loves these things.

1100
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,260
So this is going to be a gift for him.

1101
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,060
The $1,200 is a gift for me for the drug party

1102
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,780
I'm having tonight.

1103
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,460
Giant fish tank, maybe.

1104
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,500
Maybe he was like, I got to buy a giant fish tank.

1105
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,420
And it was, and then like halfway through he's like,

1106
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,900
I'll never, I travel too much.

1107
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,340
Who's going to feed these fish?

1108
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,180
Anyway, I'll just leave these rocks here.

1109
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,220
I have other things to do.

1110
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,300
I don't know why he'd be panicked though.

1111
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,220
If he needed to fill up a giant fish tank.

1112
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,340
Unless the fish were.

1113
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,460
He had a date coming over.

1114
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,980
And the guy that was coming over loved fish.

1115
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,980
He was like, oh, my tank, it's a big one.

1116
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,260
Let me just put it.

1117
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,260
I don't want to get into cubic footage,

1118
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,340
but it's a big tank, so.

1119
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,500
Or maybe the fish were already in the tank

1120
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,420
and before he could put the water in there,

1121
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,260
obviously you got to put the rocks in.

1122
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,140
So time is of the essence.

1123
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,660
And then it took so long, he's like,

1124
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,940
well, they're probably dead.

1125
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,740
They're dead now.

1126
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,300
They're dead now.

1127
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,580
I'm going to go home and start again.

1128
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,060
There's no way I'll impress that date now.

1129
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,420
Unless he likes dead fish.

1130
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,500
Unless he likes dead beta fish.

1131
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,980
Does he just like the idea of fish?

1132
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,820
Does he have to see them swimming around?

1133
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,300
We'll see.

1134
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,180
Uh, help me brothers.

1135
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,980
I really have to have a Tuesday.

1136
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,220
What?

1137
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,140
Like a number two.

1138
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,340
It has to poop.

1139
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,740
Oh, I don't know.

1140
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,620
You got any other ones?

1141
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,140
No, come on, let's do it.

1142
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,660
This is like Pee Wee Herman not wanting

1143
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,100
to get the snakes out of the pet shop.

1144
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,660
Come on, bud.

1145
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,260
All right, let's get the snakes out of the pet shop.

1146
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,340
But everyone in the office has already

1147
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,460
seen me walk across the room,

1148
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,180
go into the bathroom,

1149
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,020
see the one stall is occupied,

1150
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,020
and just walk back to my desk twice.

1151
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,780
The walls are closing in on me.

1152
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,740
Do I risk my third hurried walk to the lavatory

1153
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,980
through the thicket of judgmental glances

1154
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,580
from my co-workers?

1155
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,860
What's the play?

1156
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,420
Gmail.

1157
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:53,860
What?

1158
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,100
Okay, what's your other option

1159
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,540
other than risking the hurried walk to the lavatory?

1160
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,460
Yeah, do you want us to look you in the email

1161
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,580
and say poop your pants?

1162
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,740
Because we're not going to do it.

1163
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,700
It's not going to happen.

1164
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,820
Not here, friendo.

1165
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,620
I mean, you fucked up by not having a dead drop location.

1166
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,340
I always have a fucking dead drop location.

1167
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,220
I always do.

1168
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,940
Are you kidding me?

1169
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,580
I was in the H-E-B and I had to use the restroom

1170
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,180
quite badly and I went in the restroom

1171
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:20,980
and somebody was in there.

1172
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,180
I waited two minutes.

1173
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,380
They were still in there.

1174
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,060
And so I knew to just walk outside,

1175
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,580
go to the Thai restaurant next door

1176
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,700
and blast off in there

1177
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,740
and then come back to H-E-B,

1178
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,860
get my shopping done.

1179
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,460
You got to have a dead drop everywhere.

1180
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,220
Are you fucking new?

1181
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,740
You got to have a dead drop.

1182
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,180
It also helps if you tie some kind of bell

1183
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,540
or something to the bathroom door.

1184
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,260
So that way you can hear someone come in and out

1185
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,940
and then you can wait the appropriate 45 seconds to a minute,

1186
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,460
walk over casually like,

1187
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,740
might as well check,

1188
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,940
see if anyone's in here.

1189
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,740
Oh, empty.

1190
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,620
I could go.

1191
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,660
I can make a real cash kind of thing.

1192
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,500
I've had to do this with Rachel,

1193
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,580
sometimes I'm with one of you two.

1194
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,380
If we've stayed together in a hotel or on tour,

1195
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,820
this idea of you're in the bathroom,

1196
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,540
maybe taking a shower,

1197
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,660
maybe using the bathroom

1198
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,860
and I really have to do it.

1199
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,660
And then I call out,

1200
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,740
I plead to you,

1201
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,860
hey, I really, really,

1202
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,300
I'm so sorry.

1203
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,580
I know that I don't want to be pushy,

1204
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,780
but I really need to get up in.

1205
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,220
I've never, I don't think done that with a stranger,

1206
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,140
but I'm wondering if maybe that's like,

1207
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,980
it's a common enough human experience

1208
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,180
that if a stranger did it to me,

1209
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,620
I would blast off as fast as I could.

1210
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,580
Could you just wander in and out

1211
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,780
just saying stuff like,

1212
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,620
just like,

1213
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,460
where are my damn glasses?

1214
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,180
Gosh darn it,

1215
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,340
I really want to find my glasses.

1216
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,140
Man alive.

1217
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,100
I can't believe it.

1218
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,820
Darn the luck.

1219
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,140
And you just keep going in and out like,

1220
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,420
and it's like the door's closed.

1221
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,580
You can't go in where you think you left the glass.

1222
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,620
I am almost positive I left my darn glasses

1223
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,460
right in the dank mode.

1224
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,700
And I just need to get in there and look around.

1225
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,980
I bet they're in there.

1226
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,820
And that's why you keep ducking in and out

1227
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,740
because you've been looking for your darn glasses.

1228
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,380
Oh, and now we have them in your pocket.

1229
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,900
So when you finally use the bathroom,

1230
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,580
you come out like, found them.

1231
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,060
Found them.

1232
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,420
But you're going to be walking different.

1233
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,300
Everybody's going to know.

1234
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,820
That's why I think you should just be like,

1235
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,060
I got to blast off my ass

1236
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,380
and somebody has been in there the whole time, gang.

1237
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,820
And they'll look at you and be like,

1238
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,060
I know that feel, partner.

1239
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,100
It is pretty universal.

1240
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,900
If somebody said like,

1241
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,420
hey, the reason I keep checking the bathroom

1242
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,380
is because I need to use it

1243
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,180
and there's someone in there.

1244
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,300
I'd be like, yeah.

1245
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,460
Yeah, partner, I know that feel.

1246
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,300
We've literally all been there.

1247
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,620
Yeah, why are you announcing it?

1248
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,260
Like, why are you?

1249
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,860
Yeah, that's fine.

1250
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,220
We're all just people.

1251
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,100
We get it.

1252
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,740
We get it.

1253
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,580
My face win.

1254
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,940
I also have to blast off my ass,

1255
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,220
but someone's in the stall.

1256
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,460
Shoot.

1257
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,580
Is that what the problem is?

1258
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,540
Is that what the problem is?

1259
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:51,940
Because it's like,

1260
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,580
I was thinking about this on an airplane.

1261
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,500
They tell you not to pile up,

1262
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,100
not to like line up near the door,

1263
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,500
but you can't call dibsies.

1264
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,940
And if you stood up and said like,

1265
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,060
I need to do this,

1266
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,740
someone else in the plane might also say like,

1267
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,700
yeah, me too.

1268
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,780
And I guess we're just going to have a foot race.

1269
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,260
Aren't we?

1270
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,780
Because this is how it's going to shake out.

1271
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,060
If you announce that you have to use the bathroom,

1272
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,220
aren't you running the risk of somebody else being like,

1273
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,220
well, yeah, me too.

1274
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,460
Now that you mentioned it.

1275
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:21,780
Yeah.

1276
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,940
I'd love one right now.

1277
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,300
I'd love one.

1278
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,540
When we were on the plane this weekend,

1279
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,700
I was sitting next to Teresa,

1280
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,460
and I went to stand up and she said,

1281
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,020
oh, they asked people not to congregate around the door.

1282
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,820
And I was like, I know,

1283
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,780
but I'm standing up to establish like, I'm next.

1284
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,340
Yeah.

1285
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,740
You can't put your fucking quarter up

1286
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,700
on the airplane bathroom door.

1287
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,740
This is a gross way to end the show, maybe.

1288
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,140
No, I think it's a powerful way.

1289
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,580
No, can we talk about like a smart thing

1290
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,540
for like two seconds?

1291
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:53,940
Science.

1292
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,180
Munchquad Junior.

1293
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,940
Oh, there's another one.

1294
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,780
That's the great thing about Munchquad Junior

1295
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:07,540
is you can fit a bunch of them in a given episode.

1296
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,260
I just wanted to mention this is, again, fall is here.

1297
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,820
And another sign of the times

1298
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,420
that I just wanted to point to real quick

1299
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:22,420
is that Dairy Queen has launched their autumnal menu

1300
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,020
and the fall blizzards are here, folks.

1301
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,180
New this month, Dairy Queen snickerdoodle

1302
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,180
cookie dough blizzard treat,

1303
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,580
which has, you know, cookies and cinnamon

1304
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,780
and sugar and vanilla sauce.

1305
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,660
One that I'm not crazy about that kind of actually,

1306
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,740
frankly, it bothers me a little bit

1307
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,700
is the hot, the Oreo hot cocoa blizzard treat.

1308
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,300
A mix of Oreo cookie pieces and rich cocoa fudge

1309
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,540
hand blended with creamy vanilla soft serve

1310
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,300
that's finished with a whipped topping.

1311
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:04,100
And I just, it says from the quote from Maria Hockenson,

1312
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,220
who's the executive veep of marketing over there,

1313
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,940
set over at Berkshire Hathaway,

1314
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,700
the holding company that owns Dairy Queen.

1315
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,500
Yum, yum, who's hungry?

1316
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,980
From putting a unique twist on a treat

1317
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,660
that blends hot and cold in our Oreo hot cocoa blizzard treat.

1318
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,340
But the thing is you didn't,

1319
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,620
you didn't, and the thing is that it says hot in there

1320
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,020
and you didn't, and you didn't and you're lying.

1321
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,540
And that's just really bothers me

1322
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,140
because there's nothing hot about it.

1323
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,940
It's just, it's just, you just lied.

1324
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,460
And it's really bothers me.

1325
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,580
That's just cocoa.

1326
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,540
Yeah, it's just cocoa.

1327
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,060
There's no intervention there.

1328
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,300
They've got, intervention's a great word.

1329
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,860
They actually do have little sheets of plastic

1330
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,540
separating the hot fudge from the,

1331
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,460
it's like little pockets that's protected.

1332
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,500
They have these insular sort of pockets of hot fudge

1333
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,700
and you do need to watch out

1334
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,500
because that plastic, oh boy, it's a toxic one.

1335
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,700
My brother's one of the great minds of our time, Dairy Queen,

1336
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,660
and he's having a lot of fun, but you can have that idea.

1337
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,540
It's better than what you posted up, which was lying.

1338
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,220
It's nothing, it's nothing.

1339
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,380
You can't call a hot cocoa treat just for like fun,

1340
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,500
just to lie because it makes you feel strong.

1341
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,540
I don't understand,

1342
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,380
because you want to be better than Cold Stone.

1343
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,660
I don't fucking get it.

1344
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,460
It sucks.

1345
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,580
It makes me really angry.

1346
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,140
Anyway, Dairy Queen, Berkshire Hathaway,

1347
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,420
I still love y'all.

1348
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,820
Pumpkin Pie Blizzard, you know I'll be in for one of those.

1349
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:33,060
No question, but that's what's happening

1350
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,020
for the Fall Wizards.

1351
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,340
Folks, thank you so much for enjoying our program.

1352
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,900
We hope you had a great time.

1353
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,540
I want to personally-

1354
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,380
You sound like a normal human, Johnson.

1355
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,140
That's how people hope you do.

1356
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,060
I would like to ask you, this is the last episode

1357
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,060
I'm going to get a chance to ask you to do this,

1358
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:59,060
but if you could please pre-order the Sawbones book

1359
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,780
at bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

1360
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,660
I wrote it with my wife and it was really hard

1361
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,860
and our publisher got sold to another company

1362
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,140
right when the book came out.

1363
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,140
So we're kind of doing this on our own,

1364
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,740
kind of trying to get people to buy it.

1365
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,900
So if you would buy it, it would just be the tops.

1366
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,180
It would just mean the world to me

1367
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,380
if you'd go to bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book

1368
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,140
and pre-order that book.

1369
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,540
It comes out tomorrow, October 9th,

1370
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,940
or go to your bookstore and buy it there.

1371
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,740
That's great too if you want to do that,

1372
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,780
but I just really appreciate it and thank you so much.

1373
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,820
We have shows coming up in Denver and in Austin.

1374
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,020
You can get those tickets at mackereyshows.com slash tours.

1375
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,300
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1376
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,180
for the use of our theme song

1377
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,180
instead of partying off the album, putting the days to bed,

1378
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:48,900
which is so good.

1379
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,620
And thank you again, John, for playing us in in Seattle.

1380
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,260
That was awesome.

1381
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,860
And for once, I don't have a million things to plug,

1382
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,580
so we're good.

1383
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,080
Awesome.

1384
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,020
We can thank MaxFun for having us.

00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,940

Do you want to wrap it up?

1392
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,980
Oh wait, we do have one thing.

1393
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,100
We've got a new pin.

1394
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,020
The pin of the month is the Great Job pin.

1395

You only have until the end of the month to do it,

1402
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,820
so don't sleep.

1403
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,740
Here's the final Yahoo.

1404
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,860
It was sent in by a few folks.

1405
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,820
Thank you, everyone.

1406
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,940
It's from Yahoo Answers user Alexandra who asks,

1407
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,060
what's a better name for a moth, Timothy or Peter?

1408
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:52,180
I'm Travis McElroy.

1409
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1410
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,180
You're my brother, my brother and me.

Artist owned.

Listener supported.

1416
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,980
Are you tired of trying to keep up with the news cycle?

1417
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,700
Is bad stuff happening too fast for you to process?

1418
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,540
Don't you wish there was an easy way to find out

1419
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,180
about only the most important info you need?

1420
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,220
Hi, we're Lisa and Emily.

1421
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,420
Why don't you try our podcast, Baby Geniuses?

1422
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,020
On each episode of our podcast,

1423
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,580
we discuss a weird Wikipedia page such as

1424
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,300
Flatulence Humor, Clamato, Catalan Witches,

1425
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,300
Clippy, the Microsoft Office Helper,

1426
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,060
Death during Consensual Sex,

1427
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,660
and The Talking Mongoose.

1428
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,140
We ask each other stupid questions.

1429
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:57,140
Uh, if you got a packet with like 300 seeds in it,

1430
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,500
what kind of plant would you choose the seeds to be?

1431
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,300
That felt like you were assigned to ask me a question

1432
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,780
and there were certain words you weren't allowed to use.

1433
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,700
We talk about Martha Stewart, her pony,

1434
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,540
and other celebrity horse news.

1435
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,100
Ben Chunch.

1436
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:20,820
Every other week on Maximum Fun, Baby Geniuses.
