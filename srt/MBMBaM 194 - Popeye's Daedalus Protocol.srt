1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm the

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,680
baby, baby, baby, girlfriend McElroy. We are, you have reached us here at Prank HQ. Uh-oh.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Tomorrow is April Fool's Day, as you know, assuming you're listening to this on Monday,

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,880
and we are prepping for the biggest prank of the year. Before we came in to start recording,

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,920
when we were out in the lobby, before we came into the studio, Griffin told me he had the best,

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,520
the biggest idea for a prank to pull on anybody ever in the history of prankdom. He said it was

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,080
going to make us the mayors of prankton, is what he said. And I said, wait, hold that thought. Don't

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,040
tell me the prank plan now. We're in the lobby. Wait till we're in front of the MICs. So Griffin,

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,440
now that we have retired to the recording studio, we are in front of the mics, the show's started.

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
We're laying on our chaise lounges.

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,520
We're, lay it out for me Griffin, prank of all time. Just to let everyone know,

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,840
to reiterate that I definitely came up with ahead of time. And then I like informed Justin to set

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,200
up this intro so that I would just come out and say what the prank was that I invented ahead of

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,800
time before we started recording. I feel like I've contextualized, read stalled. You may be

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
listening to this thinking like, is this like one of those things where Justin's just saying this?

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,640
And that didn't really happen. And it's just like a fun way to see how Griffin reacts in

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,240
a situation where like, he is the lobster. He's just been thrown into the boiling water.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,600
Can he escape from the trap or is this not a trap at all? Did he mean to get his, his goose cooked?

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Mixing my animal cooking metaphors, but that's quite all right. Griffin, I'm ready

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,440
for the prank of all time. I mean, I guess there's a lot of stuff that you need to understand before

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:50,240
I can reveal the prank. Like my prank draws on a lot of different influences. Are you familiar

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,280
with the jerky boys? I am. I love their work. Not those jerky boys. I'm talking about the,

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:06,240
the hoodlums who hang out outside of my local Sit Go and they shoplift and eat beef jerky and

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,040
just like the stoop. The jerky, but the ones whose mouths always smelled like smoky teriyaki.

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
I think it's supposed to be teriyaki, but for some reason when it's smoky,

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,840
they call it smoky teriyaki. So that's important. So you need to know the jerky boys. Got it.

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,400
How much Franz Kafka have you read? I mean, just like anybody else, I understand when people reference

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,520
metamorphosis, but I have not actually read any of his work. Yeah, no, he did write a book about a

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,280
bug. I say this because my prank involves a giant bug that used to be a man. So that's going to be

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,720
tricky. I'm not going to lie to you. There's a lot of, uh, I would say impossible setup for this prank

36
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
that is going to render it literally impossible to, to achieve. But if man, if we can do it.

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,440
Okay. Now I have a question. What about Damon? Are we going to get Matt Damon on board? Is Damon

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,880
like in for this? What about Damon Waymans? Hi everybody. He's a smoky teriyaki. What about

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Damon Waymans, smoky teriyaki king of the Midwest? Um, there are three Wayans involved.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,720
Three Wayans involved. Can you guess which ones? You can't because one of them is Hank Wayans.

41
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Not a lot of people know about him. Hank Wayans the third or Hank Wayans junior?

42
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,920
Hank Wayans, um, not a, uh, he is not a famous actor, but boy, can he fucking pull a prank with

43
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,840
the best of them. Um, who's the prank on? Who are we pranking with this prank? Well, this is the

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,680
thing. It's sort of, uh, um, it's sort of like a choose your own adventure. Like it's just an empty

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,160
slate that you can fill with, you know, whoever you want to use it on. You know what I mean? It's

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
not like I'm going to prank like the president. And I mean, that would be a pretty good one.

47
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,520
Don't know how I'm going to get the bug into the white house, but the, the sorry, the bug that was

48
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,720
a human that was transformed by magic. Can you have the jerky boys poses caterers and maybe,

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, I mean, that would be easy. Cause that's their, that's their job. You think their fucking job is

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
just hanging out outside the gas station? You think that's how they make their living? No,

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
they're white house caterers. They're white house. So they're going to, they're going to,

52
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,120
they're going to sneak Maiman Waymans into the white house and some sort of like rolling cart

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,840
because he's small and also an acrobat. He's very, very, very little. And then they robbed

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,680
the casino, but at the same times they show that the casino owner doesn't really love his wife.

55
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,320
So that Maiman Waymans can get back with the wife. That's going to happen. That's not really like

56
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,560
the point of the prank. It's not really funny, but like the great thing about this prank is that

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,920
it's going to change and improve the lives of everybody involved with it. Not a joke per se.

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,760
There's not a punch. There is a, but there is a, but of the joke and it's our American president

59
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,240
in this specific example. But everybody else who's involved with it is going to get a little

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,320
something on the side. Well, Griffin, I, I'm so excited about this prank. I can't wait to,

61
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,320
to stunt it and, uh, pull it off, uh, with the whole crew, the jerky boys, Maiman Wayman,

62
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Daymans, Smoky Teriyoki, the whole gang. I'm so glad they're all going to get together for one

63
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
last big heist. Yep. And, uh, I'm glad that I was able to sort of outline exactly what the prank

64
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,120
was. Yep. Well, thank you for coming up with it ahead of time. Um, it is to just,

65
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,480
we're going to steal all the toilets. So Obama's, Obama's going to be running around. Hey,

66
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,560
I thought I had a toilet in here. Great, great, great, great, great, great impression.

67
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Hey Joe, did you, did you steal the toilets, Joe? That Joe Biden? No Biden? No, I didn't.

68
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,480
I'd left them wherever I used them. Is he Charles Nelson Riley? He's Joe Biden. Okay.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,200
Are you sure he's not the lead singer of the B-52s?

70
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,840
Super pussy. Okay. Nobody's going to get super pussy. That's like the deepest inside joke,

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,200
basically ever. That was a fake B-52 song that Griffin came up with. I don't think it's that

72
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,400
hard to explain. Six years ago. Like 150 years ago. Super pussy. Can you do it once, Griffin?

73
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Hey there, brothers. My boyfriend is in a band that's starting to get really big.

74
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,120
I go to one of his shows every weekend, pretty much. My issue, I'm assuming it's the B-52s,

75
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,080
my issue is that I don't know how to act when I watch him on stage. I feel awkward being right

76
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,720
up front staring at him, but I want him to notice me in the crowd. I'm five feet tall,

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,160
so I get lost in the crowd pretty easily. Do you have any ideas for how I can be a good,

78
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,480
supportive band girlfriend and not come off as awkward or just standing there?

79
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,960
And that's from Phelan Oxoss in Chicago. I have a question for you guys about this.

80
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,880
Is there a way to ask the boyfriend if he actually cares whether she's there or not

81
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,480
without it sounding like she's asking him to release her from going?

82
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,160
That's what I'm saying. When I played Templeton the rat in our community three production of

83
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,840
Charlotte's Web, which critics hailed that performance as revolutionary to pretending

84
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,920
to be a rat, I wanted our meme meme to be there once, but I would feel guilty if she had to sit

85
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,640
through the same shit. And it was not good outside of my revolutionary rap performance. It was not a

86
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,240
great show. I don't want her. I start to feel guilty if Momo is out in the audience 14 all 14

87
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
showings. But then the problem being that as soon as the person says, Hey, do you really care if I'm

88
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,120
there or not? All I'm afraid all it's going to sound like is, Hey, I don't want to come see your

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,680
show. You can only enjoy their ironic cover of tiny dancer so many times before it starts to

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,400
grow a little stale and perhaps the effect is lost on you. Are you putting this person on

91
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,160
blast because they're not very tall? No, I actually, that was not intentional. That would be the work

92
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,640
of a much swifter man than myself. Ooh, I have a great idea. Uh huh. Convince your boyfriend and

93
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,320
their band to start selling some merch and then you work the table. So you're there as a supportive

94
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
girlfriend. You don't have to stand up in the front. But then do you get like a cut? Cause then

95
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
your boyfriend does, but your boyfriend does. Oh, okay. Oh, that's some dog shit then. Hey babe,

96
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,520
babe, babe, babe, babe. I'm going to be up on stage shredding. Um, and then I'm going to be

97
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,000
backstage shredding too if you know what I mean. But Hey, well I'm back there. Babe, can you do me

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,080
one flavor? Babe, can you do me one flavor? Just go do this unpaid job for me and I'll get all the

99
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,200
profits. I bet you could ask for a cut. Yeah, I don't think you need to ask for a cut. I think

100
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,920
between standing there staring at your boyfriend as he sings versus like doing an activity. Yeah.

101
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,480
That you know what you're doing and is like. Get some fucking devil sticks if you want to like

102
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,600
occupy your time. Like don't, don't make this poor, this poor woman like start shoveling coal.

103
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,360
Hey, why are you shitting on my awesome idea? Travis had a great idea of this man or woman.

104
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm assuming woman only because five feet tall, but it could be a man,

105
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,680
it could be a diminutive gentleman. And because she says supportive girlfriend, but that's fine.

106
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,280
No, but Travis has a great idea. What? Okay. Let me, let me take Travis's idea

107
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,520
and push it one step further. Uh, why don't you do join the band?

108
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,600
No, well, okay. So I was going to say sort of join the band, but you don't know, uh,

109
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,920
how to play any instruments. So what do you do? You, uh, you become the dancing

110
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,440
guy in the My Name is Boss tones. Like that kind of vibe. You become like the hype man.

111
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
You become like, uh, what's that cat's name? Ben? Something like that. You become like,

112
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,240
no, like the guy who's there dancing. Like the guy who wears the nice suit and has an umbrella

113
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,000
always during outcast performances. Yes. What was his name? Oh, I used to know his name too.

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Rufus Wainwright, I think it was. I don't think that was who that was. I think it was Rufus

115
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Wainwright. I don't think that's who that was. I'm pretty sure it wasn't that. Fonzworth Bentley,

116
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,360
Fonzworth Bentley, Fonzworth Bentley. I was so close. You weren't close fucking at all. You got

117
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,760
0% of his name right. There was some similar letters. Okay, sure. So be like the Fonz or like

118
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Ben the guy from Mighty Mighty Boss tones and just dance on stage. Just get up on stage. Now

119
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,840
you don't have to dance good. In fact, it would be better if you didn't. Um, if you,

120
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,280
if you know how to skank it, that particular dance craze. Um, I don't know if your boyfriend

121
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,880
is in a ska band, but that's always a popular maneuver. Yeah. Uh, I, I think that getting

122
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,160
involved in some more concrete way, whether it be dancing or merge sales, uh, and nothing,

123
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
but those two things, uh, I think that that's going to help you pass the time, make you feel

124
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,720
a bit more purposeful, purpose-driven life. But there's like eight seasons of How I Met Your

125
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,920
Mother on Netflix that this, that this woman needs to watch. Uh-huh. But that's why I love,

126
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,120
that's why I love you sit at the merge table. You're not going to have to do anything till

127
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,680
after the band plays. You could be on Netflix on your phone, but you can't hear all the funny,

128
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,640
you can't hear all the funny jokes from Marshall and Lily and the crew. You put on headphones

129
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,840
over all the loud, loud ska music that's going on on stage. The great thing about working is that

130
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,120
when you want to not be at the concert, you have a great excuse. It's a lot harder to sell to say,

131
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm too tired to go listen to your band play than I'm too tired to go work the merge table.

132
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,520
So if you, if you solidify that that's what you do with the shows, then it is a lot more

133
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,720
excusable if you need to get out of it once in a while, because now you've turned it into a job.

134
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,240
It already sounds like a job either way. I listen to you. I have no comment on your guys

135
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
relationship or whatever, but like having to go to the same concert, like no matter how,

136
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,920
like how incredible it may be every single time, like every weekend though.

137
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,960
Hey babe, babe, babe, did you hear when I went? Yeah, like I heard it today and I heard it on the

138
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,040
28th and then I heard it on the 21st. Babe, babe, it's different. I went na na na na instead of na

139
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,400
na na na. Yeah, no, that was really, um, that was really good and it did take the song in like a

140
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,600
totally different direction, but I am just going to kick it at home today, um, because they just

141
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,360
added the first captain America movie to Netflix. But this, but tonight I was gonna go na na na na

142
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,760
here and change the title of the song. No, just my, my, just my didgeridoo part. This is a pretty

143
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,600
crazy band. What is this? Is this that? It's Rust and Root. Oh, they're back. I heard that they're

144
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
back in a big, big way, but they're back. This is, but this is like, this is the new Rust and

145
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Root, like the new monkeys. A bunch of people got together and decided to be Rust and Root again.

146
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, no, it's sort of like Doctor Who. It's just a mantle that's passed from band to band.

147
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Why does fucking well be? That's what, that's why they say send me on my way. It's like,

148
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,080
you've had fun with this band name for a while, but it's time to let it go and let somebody else

149
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,720
have a chance to be Rust and Root. Goetje actually used to be Rust and Root. Wow. And then they,

150
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,080
then they sent it on its way. Griffin, may we have a Yahoo answer question, please? Yeah, sure. This

151
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Yahoo was sent in by David DeCruz. Thank you, David. It's by Yahoo answers user. How can I

152
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,120
include? Oh, no, I fucked up. Cause they changed how the shit works. Nobody saved. Nobody y'all.

153
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,400
Thank you. Uh, thank you, David. It's by Yahoo answers user ghost gate who asks

154
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,680
how can I include my Guinea pig more in my daily life? Please help. Okay. So I have a male G pig

155
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,520
and I want to include him in my daily life. Okay. So from Monday to Friday, from like 7am to 4pm,

156
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm at school. I let him walk in my room. Whoa. I let him walk in my room, but I want to have

157
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,680
him in all my daily stuff, such as when I go out or just pretty much in everything that's possible.

158
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
But I have a problem. It's a dumb problem, but it's affecting me. Problem is that I can't afford

159
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,240
to wash every day. I'm kind of broke. And so I can't change cloth every time he loses hair on me.

160
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,840
I know it's pretty stupid, but that's my situation. So do you recommend buying a G pig carrier or what

161
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,120
do I do? He doesn't have a buddy. Oh my God. This question. He also doesn't have a buddy. I know

162
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:19,120
they supposed to be in pairs and all, but I know my story and can't really afford another G pig.

163
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,400
So that's why I want him in my life more. And not just cause of that, but also cause I want like a

164
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,080
closer friend. No, I'm not a loner, but more of a close pet cause I enjoy pet interaction. So

165
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,160
please, please help me out and give me ideas with my weird problem. Please. Thank you. Signed Bill

167
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,840
of me running down a long highway and jumping through a stained glass window? Because that's

168
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,720
what I emotionally, that's where I'm at right now. You didn't have to read it, man. That was like,

169
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,240
I felt like I was doing a Slylock Fox there. This gentleman, this gentleman can't afford to wash,

170
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:08,160
but can't afford to feed a G pig. How are your priorities? I think he can afford to wash his

171
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,400
body, but I don't think he can afford to like go to the laundromat every day because his stupid

172
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:24,320
fucking filthy pig rat got his stupid filthy hair all over his jeans and his shirts. Maybe like

173
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,560
invest in a lint roller. Maybe that would be a way that you could, or shower with your clothes on.

174
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,520
Or just put the G pig in like a Ziploc bag before you put it in your pocket.

175
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,560
That's a great idea, Trav. What's a G pig carrier?

176
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,080
I imagine it's a Ziploc bag. It's a lunchbox pretty much, right?

177
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,600
What's the point at that point? If you can't like, this is what I'm saying. How do you affix

178
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,240
this G pig to yourself in a manner that still makes it feel like you have an animal attached

179
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,800
to you? You know, back in the day, back in like French Revolution times, ladies would make their

180
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:14,880
hair into like a cage and keep live birds in it until the bird died. Maybe that. Maybe you make

181
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,400
like a G pig cage out of your hair and then the G pig rides on top of your head. Why would they

182
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,400
wait for the bird to die? Because they didn't care about it as a pet. It was just as a decoration.

183
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,040
Because they didn't know how to get it out. Well, that was also important. Guys, we fucked up again.

184
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,520
Oh, man. Listen, you did a great job with my hair, but how did you get the bird out? Ah,

185
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,720
fuck. I did it again. How didn't you notice there's a bird in my hair?

186
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,040
No, I put the bird in. I put the bird in there, but when I was constructing the framing

187
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,880
for your hair, I forgot the door part again. You left a bird in my hair. You know what's

188
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,600
going to happen. Somebody will take a picture of it. It's going to be in a history book.

189
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,680
People are going to think this is how we did it. Man, those people were dicks to their birds.

190
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,080
See, that's what they're going to say. I didn't want to burn my hair. I hate this. I hate this

191
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,440
haircut. Oh, God damn it. I love living in France though. I love France. I love France. God damn,

192
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:27,760
our bread's so good. Hey, y'all, hope we don't get beheaded. Oh, boy. You know who I'm into,

193
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,400
Napoleon. I wish someone had invented a moon pile already. Oh, shucks. Oh, hooks.

194
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Oh, man. I'm so sunburnt right now. I've got sun delirium, and I'm hoping that it's going to

195
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:58,960
like let me tap in. I know what you're saying. Iron Man style. Get this. Can you embed the

196
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,400
guinea pig in your chest? And running on a wheel somehow that powers you? Oh, I love that. That

197
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,760
would be like a fun parody. What do you think? We could do like a fun parody, like one of those

198
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,040
those fucking hilarious scary movies, like those parodies that can be like superheroes,

199
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,640
and that could be like how we do Iron Man. The thing that bothers me most about this question

200
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,920
is the idea that this person lists their guinea pig have free reign over their room.

201
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,400
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. That's crazy on many levels. One, what's it doing? Two,

202
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,920
two, can you think of anything less appealing when you finish a long day at work knowing you

203
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,680
have to go home and go on a G-Pig hunt? Is it in the laundry basket? Is it in the closet? Where is

204
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,280
it? It's small. It's hiding. Where didn't it poop? Where didn't it poop? I had a buddy in college who

205
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,560
had a hedgehog, which is like awesome. Like across the board, that's awesome. But he let it just roam

206
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,560
free in his house, in his whole house. And then like I would go over there, and every time I went

207
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,440
over there to hang out, it would be like instant dread. Like I'm going to step on this little thing

208
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,880
and it's gonna hurt me and kill him. I'm gonna sit on the wrong pillow. I'm gonna sit on the

209
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,800
wrong pillow and this hedgehog's gonna be fucking underneath it. And it's gonna be a fun prank,

210
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,560
but not fun, I guess, by any conceivable metric, because I will kill the animal.

211
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,760
I bought a moped in high school not knowing the social consequences that came with it.

212
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,840
Now that college is upon me, do I bring it to school or keep it at home and be forced to walk

213
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,400
around campus like the rest of my scholars? P.S. I bought the moped secondhand, and the previous

214
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,080
owner put a super loud exhaust on it to make it go fast. This subsequently makes me look like a

215
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,480
huge tool. That's from Easily Confused in New Hampshire. Efficiently, actually, which is weird

216
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:06,160
that you mess that up. I am so glad that they, this is textbook good question submission to

217
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,520
my brother and my brother and me, because if it had just been the first part, I would have been

218
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,880
like, I don't get the big deal. I think mopeds are pretty great. If I had one here in Austin,

219
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,040
I would use it to go everywhere. But the idea of having a super loud exhaust on it

220
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,240
takes this thing and turns it right on its head because the whole thing about a moped is that

221
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,960
you're supposed to be very, it's like a very discreet means of transport. It's a very ashamed,

222
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
it's an ashamed means. You don't have to feel shameful about it, but it's not like

223
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,400
something you want to be like, ah, moped, check me out. And if you put like a super banging exhaust

224
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,360
on it, like that's exactly what you do. It's like you put like 20 inch rims on your razor scooter,

225
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,920
like you stop it. You don't think about it. Sometimes when people own ostentatious things,

226
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,280
you tend to make assumptions about them. You don't think about the fact that they might've

227
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
just gotten stuck with it by happenstance. You know, it really makes you think, you know,

228
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,800
right? Like when I, when I inherited water, you know, when I inherited your Oldsmobile Cutlass

229
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,360
Sierra, right? Like I didn't have any choice in the matter. It was just the most balling car

230
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,960
in Huntington, Virginia at the time. And so like, I would drive around like bumping those speaker

231
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,560
rattling tunes that had broken off inside the car's cassette player. Um, and then people would

232
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,160
be like, man, what a jerk that guy must be with all of his money. I'd be like, sorry, sorry guys,

233
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,720
it's not me. It's my brother. He's the one who tricked us out. Sorry, player haters. Sorry,

234
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,120
player haters. I know the hood ornaments gone. That's what my brother did. And like,

235
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:38,320
I know it's a sick look, but it wasn't me. When the option is walking, the alternative has to be

236
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,520
better. So you just have to make peace with the fact that you're the guy with the loud electric

237
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:53,520
bicycle. Is that what a moped is? It's basically an electronic bicycle. I actually completely

238
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,040
agree with Justin on this one. Do you, Travis? I do. See that's two out of three. That's a majority.

239
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:06,400
So complete is your guy's hatred of, of, of ambulation. You would rather be like piggybacked.

240
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,440
My life, Griffin, my day to day life is trying to figure out how to make the least amount of trips

241
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
to and from someplace. If it means loading up my arms in a painful manner, just so I do not have

242
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,560
to walk back to somewhere to get more things and go back, I will do it because walking is so awful.

243
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,480
Why is it? It's like what we did for a billion years.

244
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,360
Yes. And animals see us walking and they're like, ah, we're equals. We're not equals.

245
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,120
You stupid idiots. And then the, you know, they hop on their mopeds.

246
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,920
They're all squirrel mopeds. Can you imagine? Can you imagine?

247
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
They're sitting on a Stewart Little.

248
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,200
Oh God.

249
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
I love them so much.

250
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,040
I love them when I squeeze them and squeeze them. Oh, I killed them again.

251
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Listen, I don't think mopeds have, have a, I think you are imagining a moped stigma.

252
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,280
Do you guys, let me ask you two. Do you have especially harsh feelings about mopeds?

253
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,520
No.

254
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,640
Uh, jealousy, I guess. Cause like usually if I see one I'm walking.

255
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,560
Cause otherwise I'm not going to notice. I'm just going to assume it's like a tiny motorcycle.

256
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,920
If you saw a man going on one of those giant bikes with the one huge wheel and one really

257
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,640
small wheel, you would see that and be like, fuck that dude's cool cause he's not walking.

258
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
And I am like a chump.

259
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,360
Yup. It doesn't matter what it is. If I see a guy on a dead horse,

260
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm going to think the same thing. Man, man, he's not moving especially fast.

261
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,880
If I see a guy rolling down a hill in a barrel, I'm like, nice.

262
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,640
You know, I brought, uh, Jeremy Larson bought a moped, a scooter when we were living in

263
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,400
Cincinnati together. And I was jealous on it both because it was better than walking

264
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
and more fuel efficient than driving.

265
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
It's a super good way to get around.

266
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah. It's good. If anybody gives you shit, just say like uses less gas than your car.

267
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
Yeah. Fucking asshole.

268
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,040
But that, whoa, that's the thing. When you're riding on this super loud moped,

269
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,000
you need to just be yelling shit constantly. Like, sorry, it's so loud.

270
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
It's solar powered. It runs on the sun.

271
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,680
Sun power is loud. What can you do?

272
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,000
What can you do about it? That's not the motor. That's just my farts.

273
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,400
I don't know why that would help. I don't know why that would help anything,

274
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,160
but you should do it anyway. Let me know how it goes.

275
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,520
Just don't walk. Please think about this.

276
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,960
Think of the children.

277
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,320
Think of the children. You have to walk. Dear brothers, I am six months pregnant.

278
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,040
Congratulations.

279
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Thank you. So many people in my life, whether they have kids or not,

280
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,240
keep giving me advice and I hate it. How can I politely or not so politely

281
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
tell them I don't want their opinion? That's from preggers on the Pacific coast.

282
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,600
You just gently rub your stomach and say, I'm ignoring you for two.

283
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,160
I just asked my wife. I don't know. She should be the one.

284
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,200
This should be my brother and my brother and Sydney and me.

285
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,640
Yeah. I'm sure she's getting like, you got to rub oatmeal on your tummy and your underarms.

286
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,240
Like she let me just get her real quick and then she could just feel this one for me.

287
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,480
She can pinch hit. Sure. Yeah.

288
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,560
Okay. Hold on one second. Hi. How are you guys?

289
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,680
How are you? How's the baby so far? So good. I can feel her kicking a lot more now.

290
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,680
That's weird. I said, is it rude if I ask if you're showing, I forget where you are.

291
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,160
Oh no, I am. I'm I'm over five months now. So yeah.

292
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,880
Have people started to awkwardly touching your stomach without permission?

293
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
All the time. Awesome. It's terrible. Totally great.

294
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,280
So this person is saying they're six months pregnant. So a bit more pregnant than you.

295
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Not that it's a competition. Not that it's a competition

296
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,240
with this person's winning. Maybe pick up the pace.

297
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,840
Try to rush her along. They keep getting advice. Well, we don't know if it's a he or she.

298
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,240
They keep getting advice and they, that was a joke and they hate getting the advice from people

299
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,360
and they want to know how they can politely turn it down. How much of this are you,

300
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,600
how much of this shit do you have to eat every day?

301
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,560
A lot, which is surprising because you'd think that like,

302
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,240
it'd be limited somewhat by the fact that I'm a doctor.

303
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,840
Right. That's the thing. Right. Like you are at a place I think where babies happen a lot

304
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
all the time. Yeah.

305
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,000
There are a lot of babies happening. And so like, I would assume that there's like a lot of people

306
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,080
like, let me tell you what I did. But like you, you, you went to school for like a hundred years.

307
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,840
You know, everything about every physiological issue ever. How can somebody have the hubris

308
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,640
to be like, let me tell you one thing you didn't know about babies. Don't shake them shits.

309
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,920
Like I super know that.

310
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,280
Well, it's, I think it's one of those things where every woman thinks and maybe I should

311
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,760
say rightfully so once they've been through it, once they've been through the whole, you know,

312
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,600
40 weeks of pregnancy and then the labor process that they have earned the right to tell everybody

313
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
else how to do it. And I think it's well-intentioned. I mean, most that's,

314
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
most of the advice I get is from women who are pregnant.

315
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Nobody maliciously is like, uh, just, uh, do it in a toilet.

316
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,720
I think, I think they really think like, oh, this will really help her out. This will really,

317
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,920
she, I bet she doesn't know that she's going to get nauseous. I'll tell her about it.

318
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,120
Have you ever had a point with someone like giving you advice where you've wanted to say like,

319
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,480
Hey, just shut up. I don't get out of my, I don't care.

320
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,280
Yeah. I, you know, what was funny is, uh, I have all these books that, uh, like about pregnancy

321
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,560
updates, like fun stuff for each week and thing. And they, one of them says specifically, like how

322
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,960
to deal with people giving you advice. And it tells you to just be polite, which is what I try

323
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,720
really hard to do is just say, Oh, thanks. And nod and smile and walk away. Um, but it's really hard

324
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,560
at, cause a lot of the time I'll just snap back. Yeah, I know. I know I basically know everything.

325
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,480
Got it, chief. Thanks. I catch myself doing this a lot, uh, or I have, and I'm trying to curb it,

326
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,120
um, vis-a-vis marriage because a lot of my friends are getting engaged out here in Austin and

327
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,560
Rachel and I were like, one of the first, I would say couples to, to get married. And so like,

328
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,880
I catch myself like saying to people like, you just got to make sure to really like in the moment,

329
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,560
just really treasure it because, and I like barf in my own mouth and I'm like, I'm so sorry. I don't

330
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,680
know what that was. I don't know who that was. I'm sorry. No, we all do it. I think Justin and I

331
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,800
probably did it to both of you guys at your weddings. I mean, I think that's human nature.

332
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,480
And I try to take a video with your mind posted on your soul Facebook. What are you saying to

333
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,360
me right now? Just remember all the people who were here and how happy they were. And

334
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,640
has anyone given you advice that you were like, Oh shit, that's tight. Yeah. Great. I'm going to

335
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,040
do that. Um, you know, I didn't know about actually, I don't know if it's sort of advice,

336
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,680
kind of a tip you and Rachel gave me that snuggle. Oh yeah. I didn't know that existed. Well, I mean,

337
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,240
that's sort of like my whole game now is all about maximizing my, my sleeping structures.

338
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,440
I'm sorry. I'm going to need someone to clarify for me what a snoogle is.

339
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:36,080
Is it a snoogle or a snoodle? Snoogle. Okay. And it is what now? It's this giant pillow,

340
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,240
like this long worm like pillow that kind of coils up and you can just wrap yourself like

341
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,640
completely in it when you sleep. What? Yeah. Awesome. It's basically every sort of human

342
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,400
invention and like thing that we have as a species have like figured out has culminated

343
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,200
in the snoogle. Um, because it really takes your sleeping game. Can I, can I ask you a question

344
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,280
Sydney, because you are now far more experienced with the snoogle than I am. Is it weird if I get

345
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,600
one, even though I am not now, nor will I ever be pregnant and Rachel, Rachel will get pregnant at

346
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,680
some point, but this is my snoogle actually, babe. Um, we can get a second one off Amazon, babe,

347
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,800
but this one's mine. I've like sort of impressed onto it. My body contours already. You can have

348
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,840
matching his and her snoogles. Oh no, because I wouldn't want to get it confused and then

349
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,160
accidentally sleep using her snoogles and her impressions because that's a fate worse than

350
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,520
death. It's, I think it's fine. Cause I fully intend to continue to sleep with this after I

351
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,760
am no longer pregnant. Yeah. It's fantastic. Um, excellent. But, but most of the advice I get

352
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,320
is not as helpful as the snoogle. Um, well no, cause that's actionable stuff. It's like if,

353
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,200
if every piece of advice I got came with a hammock, I'd be like tight. Yes, I will take,

354
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,920
I will take that. I will make my pizzas with a pizza stone. Thank you for the advice in the

355
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,800
hammock. No, a lot of people want to give me advice about what they ate to like keep them

356
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,400
from being nauseous. I've found that's the most common advice. And I keep telling people like,

357
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Oh, thanks. I'm not really nauseous anymore. Thanks. Just a Tina's pizzas is like basically

358
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,840
it. Thank you though. I just want pizzas. And then a lot of people want to tell me about how

359
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm not going to sleep. This is why it always seems to me like the advice is like a schadenfreude

360
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
kind of thing where it's like, well, you know, you're not going to sleep. You're going to puke

361
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,400
a lot. You might poop yourself. It's like, it always is like this. It's, it never sounds helpful

362
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,960
to me. You never know how bad it's going to be. Listen here. You think you know some shit. You

363
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,360
don't know shit. It's going to be so much worse. That's exactly what it is. That's what people just

364
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,600
want to tell you how bad things are going to get. And I don't know. I don't know what at the end,

365
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,280
but Oh, but at the end you don't sleep ever again after it. You don't sleep over again,

366
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,560
but they always cap it off with the same thing. Whatever terrible thing they've told you,

367
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,520
you're going to never sleep. You're going to get puked all over. It's going to be awful.

368
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,720
Then they say, Oh, but it's all worth it. It's all so much worth it. It's so worth it. It's like,

369
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,160
well yeah, I freaking hope so. Or at this point, even if it's not, I'm kind of in too deep.

370
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:22,320
I've committed myself. Yeah. We're at that. We're just going for it. So, so I don't know. My best,

371
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,760
my best answer is I just, I try to stay calm and I don't listen a lot and I nod and smile.

372
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:36,800
You should give them advice about how to fix whatever, um, like physical thing they might

373
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,600
have wrong with them. Um, it looks like you're like, Hey, how's your diabetes going? Well,

374
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,120
I mean, you don't have to go that personal. You can do like, Oh, great. Here's some advice about

375
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,600
how to like make your bangs work for you. Cause right now they're working against you.

376
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,920
That would work. Cause I don't know anything about that. So it would be good.

377
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,760
You're fighting, you're fighting your bangs right now. You need to work with them as a team.

378
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,720
You know, if all else fails, this works for me. I just say, Ooh, I've got to go pee again

379
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,960
and walk away. That's you are not going to be able to play that smoke bomb card for much longer. You

380
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
need to savor it while you can. There you go. I try to do that same thing now and people just

381
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,920
look at me like I'm disgusting. I'm going to go pee. I got to pee later. Now see when pregnancy,

382
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,440
you got to revel in that. Oh, I've got to pee again. And everybody always understands it.

383
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,120
And then it's adorable too. Oh, she's got to pee again. Oh, cause there's a baby in there.

384
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,640
Um, Sydney, do you want to thank you for sharing some light on shedding some light on this? Do you

385
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,040
want to take us to the money zone? Sure. I'll, I'll drive us there. Justin usually says like a thing,

386
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,120
like, uh, um, if you need to support a baby, yeah, stuff like that. Like he usually does like a fun

387
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,880
thing like that or something about us needing money. So, um, here's some great pregnancy advice

388
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,800
for everybody. If you're gonna raise a child, you know what you need for that? You need to

389
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,760
if you're gonna raise a child, you know what you need for that? What? Lots of money. There you see.

390
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:22,480
That was great. Was that good? Yeah. Got a message to Alita from Will. It's, uh,

391
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,320
I guess rhyming couplets, I guess. Are you, you get really, really uncomfortable with having to

392
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,320
like be a vessel for other people's romance. No, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. I was gonna

393
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:45,840
make it really erotic. Yeah. That's because he can't not. Oh boy. Dripping with eroticism. No,

394
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,640
no, no, no. Let Justin do it. You're ruining it. You filled me with love and joy since before I

395
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,320
got on one knee, but marriage to you is greater still. It's how we were meant to be. I know not

396
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,840
what next year will bring, the sights that we will see, but I don't care where you go

397
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:11,040
as long as it's with me. Happy first real life married anniversary. I don't know if they meant

398
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,160
for that last part to rhyme. You definitely made it work. I just did my best. I'm sorry, Alita. No,

399
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,920
Will. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, Alita. That's both of you. That's your celeb name. See, that's

400
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,200
the best gift we can give them. Yeah, you got a celeb name. Not a big deal. Griffin Trav. Travis.

401
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,280
Yes. We got any other important messages? Yeah, this one is for Jody, and it's from

402
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,800
Bayon or Bayon? Bayon. Say all of them and they can just. Yeah, that's just for the Justin McElroy

403
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,600
scattershot method. This is for Jody from Bayon, Bayon, Bayon, Bayon, Bayon. Bayon,

404
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,960
Bayon. Wait, Wayman, Wayman. Vega. This is from Vega from Street Fighter. Hey, Bubby, what's up?

405
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,880
Hope you're having a sweet day, but why don't you go ahead and open up that glove compartment and

406
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,360
see what's inside? Oh, Jesus. What's that you say? Travis, what is that? I can't, I can't take it.

407
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:19,440
A gun? Is it a gun? Oh my God. A ring? Dun, dun, dun. Will you marry me? Oh my God. God, Bayon.

408
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,920
It was a gun. Get down. Oh no, get out of the car. Get out of, just kidding. Say yes, God.

409
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,200
Say yes to the gun. That is beautiful. I'm so happy. Congratulations. No, I know there's,

410
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,600
right now there's, oh, listen, we, we should like just give them a minute. Cause right now there's

411
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,560
like that afterglow where it's like, I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe

412
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,600
Travis asked me to marry him. I can't believe you did it like this. This is so romantic. What were

413
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,080
you thinking Bayon, you asshole? I want to mention something. What I, my favorite thing about this,

414
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,480
uh, proposal, let them, we'll give them their moment. Yeah. And the rest of us will talk over

415
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,480
here. Bayon, just like turn the volume down for like a minute. Cause we're going to say dumb

416
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,240
shit and we're just going to like step all over your magic moment. Yeah. So have your magic moment,

417
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,520
pause it and then come back. My favorite thing about this message is that it says,

418
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,040
it literally says dramatic pause on here, but there is no dramatic pause. The dramatic pause

419
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,800
is between a ring question mark and will you marry me? So not a dramatic pause as the contents

420
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,120
of the glove compartment are revealed, but a dramatic pause is the reality. What could this

421
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,920
ring mean? What is this ring? We also don't know if we gave, if we gave Jody enough time to open

422
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,280
the glove compartment to see what she might've had hands full of taco bell. Why don't she listen to

423
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,160
this while she's like sitting in bed? I love compartment. I don't know what you mean. What

424
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,480
if the money zone starts on this episode and Bayon's driving and he just keeps discouraging

425
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,160
her from picking things up. Put that down, put that down, put it down. Keep your hands free.

426
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,480
Keep your hands free. You are holding, you are double fisting Crunchwrap Supremes right now.

427
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,840
You need to put at least one of them down because I need you to have a free hand. If not both,

428
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,880
cause I'm worried about you. Also. Yes. That's too many Crunchwraps. Speaking of snacking smarter.

429
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,040
Hold on. Let's congratulations Jody and Bayon. We're very, very, very happy. Thank you for sharing

430
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,040
your, your super special moment with us. That's incredibly nice. We have a mission for you.

431
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,680
Listeners. A mission. You're a snack smarter and you're going to get in shape by summer.

432
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,560
Your enemy, the vending machine. Don't go running. What just happened? What? Did Travis just drop

433
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,480
off? No, no. He was just on my sales pitch. Okay. You guys were just like trading. Sorry.

434
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
Well, it was like, that's what it sounds like when people get into a rhythm. I know it's so,

435
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,600
so rare on our show that you think that we're having technical difficulties when people are

436
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,680
actually actually communicating. Is Skype breaking up? Now we're just like working together and like

437
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,920
having a conversation like without talking all over each other. It's weird. Anyway. Naturebox

438
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,920
is a company that is going to put great tasting snacks right in your mailbox. They're not just

439
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,520
great tasting. Right in your face. A Naturebox funnel technician will kick in your door and start

440
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,640
jamming it right down there. They got BBQ kettle kernels. They got everything. Bagel sticks.

441
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,520
They got South Pacific plantain chips and over a hundred more options. Wow. Really? Yeah. Have they

442
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,240
been expanding their game? Their game is like elevated. Every time you go back, they have,

443
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:27,280
they legally have to have new snacks based on what I just said. So salted caramel pretzel pops

444
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,840
are my jam. I would also recommend they have some like French toast granola. That's like really,

445
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,080
really good if you want that. And it's all like real. There's no like high fructose corn syrup

446
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,720
or artificial stuff or like non GMO. And I know your mouth's watering right now. The good news

456

457
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,840
I think who listen to the show are familiar with it because they've, they've helped us out with

458
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,600
sponsorships before. Uh, but they've been improving the platform really frequently since, since, uh,

459
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,440
since they started advertising with us, there's new features and designs and better support for

460
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,480
the platform. They have a new, like sort of, uh, uh, uh, tailored, like pre-made designs that you

461
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,480
can start with and a lot of options to change it. And so to look tight to begin with, and then you

462
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,040
can change, you know, how it is tight for you. And every space has a, it, they have responsive

00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,480

465
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,320
inspiration is going to strike, you know, I don't know when I'm going to want to work on my webpage.

466
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,320
Maybe I'll want it to do in the afternoon or 3 am or whatever. I got to follow the muse. Sure.

467
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,240
The good news is that they're available. They got to support you available 24 seven. So whenever the

468
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,720
web muse strikes me, I can just go on, go get some help or just you get super drunk on white wine

469
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,320
and then you need someone to talk to. Give them a call 24 seven. They're there. How do I website

470
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,280
like go back? They'll talk you down from a bad LSD trip. You need to drink three waters.

471
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,800
Go drink three waters. Get in bed. Somebody get this man, some orange juice and graham cracker

472
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,200
and stay calm. You need to spend to the chill out to it. You need to get him to the job.

473
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,040
10. He needs to drink three waters. He needs to urinate. You need to urinate, sir. And flush

474
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,880
these toxins. I want to make a website. I want to make a website. There's a gorilla in my chair.

475
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,880
How do I get the grill out? So I can sit down on my desk and do my typing

476
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:33,760
inside. The gorilla is stealing my.com. My gorilla put the bottom in his mouth and he's

477
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:43,040
drinking all the internet in the world. The grill is still stronger. He's a genius. We're all doomed.

481
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,720
I'm the new host of International Waters, the transatlantic comedy show where land laws

482
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,120
do not apply. I am here with one of our writers, Sarah Morgan from the UK. Hello,

483
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,800
Sarah. Hi, Dave. How are you doing? I didn't understand a word you just said. Could you

484
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,840
explain International Waters and how it works? It's a transatlantic panel game. We have teams

485
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,720
based in the UK and in LA, and basically people try to be funnier more than they try to know

486
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,520
things. I caught about half of that. Find International Waters on maximumfun.org.

487
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,040
Thank you for your attention. I will see you on International Waters. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

488
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,440
Please. This one was sent in by Charles Decker. Thanks, Charles. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

489
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,640
Wait for it to load on Yahoo's new shitty website. This is asked by Yahoo Answers user Travelman

490
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:57,120
who asks, how do Popeye's employees know you've eaten there before?

491
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,920
Oh, the first time I have to say anything else, I get it.

492
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,760
The first time I went there, they just said welcome to Popeye's.

493
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,320
But now they always say welcome back to Popeye's. How do they know I've eaten there before?

494
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,200
Hmm. Statistically speaking-

495
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,760
Everyone's eating. Everyone's eating at Popeye's.

496
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,640
I have to tell you guys, I've never eaten at Popeye's.

497
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,560
I've never eaten at a fucking Popeye's. Griffin, you haven't fucked, you fucking liar.

498
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,320
When did I eat at a Popeye's? When there was a Popeye's, there was a Popeye's like

499
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,520
right across the main road from our apartment when we lived in Batavia.

500
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,680
And you just assumed that I fucking hoved over there at some point.

501
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,360
No, we ate there together. I brought you back some Popeye's,

502
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,200
we ate it together like brothers. It was a special goddamn moment in our

503
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,320
relationship. It was a moment.

504
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,680
How could you fucking forget that? I can't believe you don't remember it.

505
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,480
Right, but I can't- When we finally became brothers.

506
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,680
If I cross the threshold of the Popeye's, are they gonna be like, hey, I know you've

507
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,880
never been here before, but you've consumed our products, so welcome here.

508
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,280
Welcome back for the first time, if you know what I mean.

509
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,080
Griffin McElroy, Social Security Number 138311412.

510
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,240
I'm sensing a real opportunity to open one of these in Huntington.

511
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,840
Just because, like, there isn't one and everyone needs it to stay alive?

512
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,040
Yeah, apparently everyone's been there except all of us, so maybe if I open one-

513
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,280
You open a- You open a Popeye's, and right next door, Jack in the Box,

514
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,800
and you'll be a very rich man. Did you guys hear the news, by the way?

515
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
We got a- We got a Chipotle now, so you have to come back.

516
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,320
I know, we talked about this in the last- We talked about this in the last-

517
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,800
We talked about it- You can come back.

518
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,080
It- But it opened. But it opened.

519
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,960
You think- Hold up, you think that's why Travis and I bounced, is we were like,

520
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,240
no big fat burritos? I can't get any Chipotle here.

521
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,960
I just figured that's why you left. It w- I knew it wasn't me,

522
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,760
so I figured it was Chipotle. It wasn't you?

523
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,480
It was guacamole. It's the guacamoles.

524
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:00,640
I've- I haven't been to Popeye's, but I guess they're- Okay, I have an answer.

525
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,960
I think that they say welcome back to Popeye's, because if they said welcome to Popeye's,

526
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,000
what that puts on the employees is this expectation

527
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,800
that you're gonna have to explain all the nuance to ordering at Popeye's.

528
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,080
You have to give them the full sales pitch. None of them want to do that.

529
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,600
So to circumvent having to walk you through the experience of choosing your breading

530
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,240
and biscuit combos, they say welcome back to Popeye's and just assume that you know the drill.

531
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,640
Sure. It's like when you run into somebody at a party,

532
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
and you can't remember if you've met them before,

533
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,160
um, and so you just go, hey man! Like that.

534
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,800
Exactly. That's exactly- Yes, that's exactly.

535
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
And then of course, you haven't met them before, and you look like a fucking crazy person.

536
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,640
But if you commit to it, they look like they have amnesia.

537
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,200
Right. Right.

538
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,840
Does Popeye's embed all of us with secret ID chips in traps all around?

539
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,880
Oh, yeah. Okay.

540
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,040
I mean, I just- I mean, I know it was a pretty obvious question. I just wanted to like-

541
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,080
You think that's what the spice is made out of? Secret ID chips?

542
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,160
Is there spice on that- on that food?

543
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,120
On that food?

544
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,560
No, if you don't get it spicy.

545
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,060
Okay.

546
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,200
But they strongly recommend you get it spicy, otherwise they can't track you.

547
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,360
That's how I stayed off the grid this long.

548
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,480
Listen, Suga, how are we gonna be able to keep tabs on you, sweet baby?

549
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,760
Who is this employee?

550
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,160
That's the lady who's in their commercials.

551
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,600
She's like a southern sort of southern lady who welcomes you back with open arms.

552
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,680
Come on and eat on my nano machines.

553
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,040
Don't you want to get super strong, Suga?

554
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,360
I'll activate the dailiest protocol.

555
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,720
That's my guarantee to you, Suga. Just go ahead and suck them down.

556
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,400
Suck down these marrow bones.

557
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,840
You'll get to jump super high and we'll know everything that you buy and eat.

558
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,720
No problem.

559
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,040
They can talk to your credit card.

560
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,240
That's convenient, Suga.

561
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,120
Oh boy.

562
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,960
Is it okay to play music from my phone to cover up any possible sounds made

563
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,840
while using a bathroom at work or in public?

564
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,160
And that- this person has-

565
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,320
Holy shit, the bravery.

566
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,640
This person has neglected to come up with a clever nom de plume.

567
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,760
Should we- it was clearly an accident that he didn't do this.

568
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,320
Can we come up with one for him, please?

569
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,720
Sure.

570
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,480
All right, let's- what do we know about him?

571
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
We know his name is Kirk and he lives in Maryland.

572
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,160
And he uses the bathroom and he's apparently real, real noisy in there.

573
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,680
Okay, so I don't know-

574
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,040
Whatever he's doing in there, he's making a significant amount of decibels doing it.

575
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,600
That's from-

576
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,000
Decibel-deucing in Maryland.

577
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,120
That's from decibel-deucing in Maryland.

578
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,280
So, I think that's too obvious.

579
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,000
The best thing you could do is wait for flush windows, which I think we've all done, right?

580
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,200
Your- your problem isn't that this is-

581
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Your problem is that it's obvious that if you-

582
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,320
if you go to the bathroom and the person in the stall next to you

583
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,440
is fucking rocking out to Splish Splash, I was taking a bath,

584
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,120
then you think like, oh, that person's playing music because they're pooping.

585
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,400
You don't think, why is there music in the bathroom right now?

586
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,320
I mean, because that's- okay, not to get a little blue,

587
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,000
but the sound- pooping sounds belong in the bathroom.

588
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,840
No one is upset by hearing those.

589
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,640
I am upset.

590
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,200
They make cringe.

591
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,920
Every could I-

592
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,520
They make cringe slightly.

593
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,720
Every time.

594
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,440
I'm not kidding.

595
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,280
I'm a grown ass man.

596
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,640
I just bought a house.

597
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
I own land.

598
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,400
If I hear someone make loud poop sounds in the bathroom in the stall next to me,

599
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,880
I have to suppress a laugh every time.

600
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,760
I have to suppress a laugh every time, 100% of the time.

601
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,240
Okay, this might sound outlandish to a lot of people listening right now.

602
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,040
When I was in Japan, all of their fucking super toilets

603
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,280
that beat the shit out of our toilets, our dumb caveman toilets,

604
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,640
have incredible buttons on them,

605
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,200
like one that will blow a sweet scent into your butt

606
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,440
and one that will shoot water into your butt.

607
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,960
A lot of things involving putting things in your butt to make it a better butt.

608
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,920
What it also has is a noise button that you can play

609
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,120
and it will make the sound very, very loud,

610
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,800
shockingly, surprisingly loud, of just running water.

611
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,000
This is good for two reasons.

612
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,160
One, it helps sort of get things going.

613
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,680
Two, it disguises your shame with the sound that's already pretty natural in the bathroom,

614
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,280
but better than the alternative of the sound that your butt is definitely already making.

615
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,640
Yeah, no response to that.

616
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,080
That's because you both realized that all three of us live in the wrong fucking country.

617
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,240
Yeah.

618
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,080
You know, what I found when I was in Scotland is that they've developed technology

619
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:57,600
in which when the stall doors close, they overlap so that you cannot peek through them.

620
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,120
I really appreciate that.

621
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,720
There are, if you're gonna play music,

622
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,280
there are a couple of things that are important to do.

623
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,600
The first one is you have to also say out loud,

624
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,840
where is that music coming from?

625
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Are they piping that in so you can cover up that it's coming from you?

626
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,360
Second, play something that's gonna blend in really nicely,

627
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,760
like perhaps the music of 311,

628
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,120
that is largely indistinguishable from the sound of someone making a mountain.

629
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,960
Is audiobooks better?

630
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,520
You know what?

631
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,720
No, because then you might think someone's talking to you.

632
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,400
What about live streaming like NPR?

633
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,360
Do you think there's somebody who uses our podcast to poop too secretly?

634
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

635
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,480
I mean, just statistically, yes.

636
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,200
Maybe, could you play loud, like whimsical pooping sounds

637
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,440
to cover your real ass pooping sounds?

638
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,160
Just like go Elton John on the fart piano?

639
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,880
Yeah, seems to me.

640
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,800
But then, because then whoever is listening will be like,

641
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,080
ah, some jokester.

642
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,320
Some jokester and he was trying to make a joke.

643
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,560
And then you do that enough and then you become the office jokester.

644
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,160
It's like, ah, that's Kirk.

645
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,600
Dude, oh shit, I said his name.

646
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,000
No, I'm sorry, Kirk.

647
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,760
Now everyone will know that Kirk poops.

648
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,800
You become the office jokester.

649
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,160
If you're in Maryland and you meet a Kirk, just know this,

650
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,280
he has made a vowel movement.

651
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,440
He has made at least one whoopsie daisy.

652
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,760
If you become Kirk the office jokester on the fart piano

653
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,440
and everybody knows when they hear that,

654
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,760
then like, oh, it's just Kirk acting a fool.

655
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,400
And then you can start phasing the application out.

656
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,600
Then you can start phasing the app out of the rotation.

657
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,560
Yeah, just then when you make a vowel movement,

658
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,080
all you have to do is shout, get it?

659
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh, that's over him.

660
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,720
Oh, I love that.

661
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,880
He's using the fart sax button.

662
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,320
That is a fart sax solo.

663
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,360
That's my very, very favorite button on his fart piano app.

664
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,400
No, it's not.

665
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,880
He doesn't.

666
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,600
All right, listen, thank you guys so much

667
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,800
for hanging out with us this week.

668
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,000
We hope you had a lot of fun.

669
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,080
One last thank you to everybody who gave in the Max Fun Drive.

670
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,320
We crushed previous records.

671
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,720
We had over 2,500 new donors and upgrading donors.

672
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,840
That's amazing.

673
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,440
That's fucking bananas, guys.

674
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,800
Thank you so much.

675
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,640
I thought maybe this was gonna be the year

676
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,920
when everybody was finally like,

677
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,920
we're giving money to this?

678
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,720
But instead they were like, we need to give money to this.

679
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,800
It's unbelievable.

680
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,200
So thank you guys.

681
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,760
You're the absolute best, best, best.

682
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,960
Make sure you listen to some other programs

683
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
on the Maximum Fun Network.

684
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,640
We've got a lot now.

685
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,280
Got a lot of different offerings for you.

686
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,640
There's the Goose Down is very funny.

687
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,280
Lady to Lady is very funny.

688
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie is another great one.

689
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,720
Bullseye.

690
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,240
If you liked when Sydney stepped in

691
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,360
and helped us out with a question

692
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,360
and you haven't listened to Sawbones yet,

693
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,040
first of all, what's the matter with you?

694
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,560
Second of all, go listen to Sawbones.

695
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,480
Justin and Sydney host it and it's awesome.

696
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,800
So thanks to people tweeting about the show.

697
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,400
Rhodes Clark got his donation in under the wire.

698
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,920
So thank you so much.

699
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,320
Thank you to Tim Brick and A. Foster

700
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,120
and Paperback Princess Emile Dallaire.

701
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,800
I'll just take a shot there.

702
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,240
Alyssa Jefferson, Nick, John Rom, Ashley,

703
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,360
Honey Boy, The Tontons, so many others.

704
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,840
Thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

705
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,680
The Tontons are a band by the way.

706
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,000
I know, I feel so bad they invited me to come hang out

707
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,320
at one of their shows here in Austin

708
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,880
and I was too busy getting horribly, horribly sunburned

709
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,680
in a different city or else it would have been there.

710
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,440

And a big thanks to John Roderick of the Long Winters

721
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,440
for the East Front Team song It's a Departure

722
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,280
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

723
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,280
We've been singing the praises of that album for a long time

724
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,120
but it really is very good.

725
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,880
Do wish there was a new album to talk about and promote.

726
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,200
I would like that very much.

727
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,280
I would like that very, very much if that could happen.

728
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,640
But you know what?

729
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,200
The wind is gonna blow where it's gonna blow

730
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,240
and you can't change it.

731
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,680
But you can't control the wind.

732
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,400
Can't control the wind and what is John Roderick but the wind?

733
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,040
He is the wind of people.

734
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,680
Anyway, thank you John and company.

735
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,880
We are going to be performing a live show on May 24th

736
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,680
at the People's Improv Theater in beautiful New York City.

737
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,680
As you may have seen, tickets for that are sold out

738
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,200
but we are going to be releasing more tickets Wednesday at noon.

739
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,760
So just go to the pit-nyc.com and you will be able

740
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,360
to get those tickets Wednesday around noon-ish.

741
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,920
So keep an eye out.

742
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,680
We don't actually like the ones pulling the trigger

743
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,120
so we can't guarantee at noon but that's the plan.

744
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,040
Wednesday at noon, more tickets.

745
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,360
I think that's gonna do it for us.

746
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,240
Kripp, do you have a question that you could maybe read for us

747
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,720
from Yahoo and then we can kind of think about it

748
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,640
in the intervening week and we'll answer it next week?

749
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,360
Oh, absolutely.

750
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,200
This final Yahoo was sent in by Brian Couch.

751
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,840
Thank you, Brian.

752
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Calamity who asks,

753
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,760
how do I keep my son from naming my grandson YOLO?

754
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,720
I'm Justin McElroy.

755
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

756
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

757
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

758
00:58:49,920 --> 00:59:01,920
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

759
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,640
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

760
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,360
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

761
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,080
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

762
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,320
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

763
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,720
or just the guitars or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

764
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,760
If you're a fan of music, if you make music

765
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,360
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

766
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,520
come check it out on MaximumFun.org.

767
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,160
Thanks.
