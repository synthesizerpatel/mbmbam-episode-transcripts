1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Maginera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I be your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,360
Yo, g'day. Hail and well met. I'm your youngest, Harold.

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,080
Don't love this.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,280
Griffin.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,920
I don't love it.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,120
We're high in the fantasy spirit, because we've just returned from

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,760
the biggest nerd event of the year, good, gentle folk.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,160
Folks, the rumors are true. The meek have inherited the earth.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh wow.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
These nerds, they're running the show.

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,120
Oh, I see.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,880
I looked for a solid week for someone to talk to me about sports.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
Yeah, you remember that poster that was hanging up on high school walls?

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,480
It's like, if you get made fun of now, don't worry, you'll be Steve Jobs.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,200
Oh, I saw hundreds of thousands of Jobses here.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
Everyone was a Steve Jobs.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah, Jobses, Jobses everywhere, but not a basketball to drink.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,200
Did you guys make any new, you know, big celeb friends?

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,720
That's why you go to Comic Con for the connectiones.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,360
You know what I mean?

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Yeah, you brush your elbows with arrow.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,400
You brush your shoulders with flash.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,440
I met Spider-Man, got a photo with Spider-Man.

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
Spider-Man came to our signing, and he said,

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
thank you, it's such an honor to meet you.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
And I'm like, are you kidding with me right now?

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,680
After all you've done?

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
You're the web slinger.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
After all your good work.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I left, here's how, what's cooler than being at a cool party?

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Ice cold.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Leaving a cool party.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,240
I left Comic Con's most exclusive event to go home and eat a muffin top.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,520
A chocolate muffin top and a drink of vitamin water

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,240
in my hotel room while I play Dragon Quest Builders.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
That's kind of the most exclusive.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,520
The most exclusive party is the one you leave.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,440
It was, I've never seen anything like it before my entire life.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,600
There were famos littered, strewn about.

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
I stepped over the corpse of Stephen Amell.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
He was just there, there's like 30 arrows there.

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,640
I was playfully pushed into the pool by Taye Diggs,

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
but then I bounced off of Cuba Gooding Jr.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
who was in the pool to land on the other side

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,960
without getting wet, so many famoses.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,680
And you're over there and you got caught by John Cryer.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
And John Cryer said you safely made it to the other side.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
Actually, that's not a joke, he was there.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
Yes, and you can tell that when John Cryer said

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
the thing about making it to the other side,

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,640
he meant both literally the pool and figuratively

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,600
to the other side of fame.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,560
To the other side of fame, and now we're all famoses.

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
You know what people won't tell you about red carpets?

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
And this is probably not for everyone.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
I've only been to one red carpet event in my entire life.

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Well, the Margaritaville was a blue carpet,

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,240
but this was a red carpet event.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
We've only been on one side, yes.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,640
You only are there, you could just walk in.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
So there was a door that you walk,

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
this is Entertainment Weekly thing.

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,960
And it was an honor, wow, what an honor.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,120
Wow, what an honor, H-O-N-O-R.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
So anyway, we went.

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,640
And you go in, and they're like,

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,120
well, there's the entrance, and then over there

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,680
is where the red carpet is.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,200
To go on it, you have to wait in like a line.

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
And this line is like, there's some people

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,760
from the new Spider-Man movie in this line.

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,600
John Cryer is in this line.

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
We were ahead of the Spider-Manzes.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,200
The Spider-Manzes was behind us.

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Not a Spider-Man, but like some cast member from Spider-Man.

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
Legit, I mean, top tier talent

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,480
that I honestly, earnestly suggested

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
we should let them go in front of us.

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
There's no way that we should be.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
But you could just go into the party,

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,200
which is what a lot of people were doing.

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,000
There were five minutes less of canapes

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
for the cast of Spider-Man because they had to wait

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
for us to finish getting our picture taken.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
Strange but true.

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,400
I did enjoy making good, good friends with David Harbour.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,640
Now we didn't, we didn't talk.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,100
Yeah.

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
And we were only in the same place for like half a second

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,960
as he got into a car as we got out of a car.

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,560
But I felt him like register

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
like my celebrity Musk on the air.

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
And like I registered his, and I think he was like,

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
there's another like big bearded man here.

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,640
Sure, yeah.

101
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,960
I saw it Travis, he was getting in the car

102
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
and you guys like met eyes and just walked by each other

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
and he tickled you real fast.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
He tickled you real quick.

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
Real quick, he and I took a second

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
to bully Tom Hiddleston for being a nerd.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,240
It was so fast, it was so fast.

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,560
Yes, but like that was the only connection we made

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
just real quick, me and David Harbour

110
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,760
bullied Tom Hiddleston and then David Harbour had to go.

111
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,640
But he did, he kissed me on both cheeks

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,040
and said, now the power is yours.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
We were standing outside this party

114
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
waiting for the person that was supposed

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
to get us into the party.

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
And we were waiting there feeling like we didn't belong.

117
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
And as we're standing there feeling incredibly uncomfortable

118
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
and really not of a place where we should be there at all.

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,920
Tom Hiddleston, TV's Loki walks out of this place.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,680
TVS's Loki.

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,920
TVS's Loki walks out and walked past us

122
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
and to get into his car.

123
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,760
And I asked Griffin, I said, I hope he didn't eat

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,080
all the free hot dogs that he had

125
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
because he had that sort of self-satisfied grin

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
on his face that he always had,

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
which I'm assuming is because he ate all the free hot dogs.

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,320
And he kept patting his tummy and saying,

129
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
yum, yum, hot dog tummy.

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
Yum, yum, winter king.

131
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,200
And then I did a fun accent where I was like,

132
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,040
they got split up buns, they got brioche.

133
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,800
They got a new topping only famos know about.

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
They got hot dogs too.

135
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
The sequel to dogs.

136
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,400
Yeah, that was fun.

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
Fun time.

138
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,280
It wasn't fun.

139
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,760
Maybe for Travis it was fun.

140
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,320
Maybe you had fun.

141
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
It was way fun for me.

142
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
Good, I'm glad you all received energy from it

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,200
instead of having it depleted from you like a vampire.

144
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
I expected to be arrested.

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
That's where I was at as I was walking around this party.

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,440
I fully expected a helicopter to swoop in and arrest me.

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
They wouldn't even send an officer.

148
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,280
They would just kind of scoop me up with a big claw.

149
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,200
They would lower one of those things that they use

150
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,360
to rescue people who have been injured in the desert.

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,760
Yes, except it's got a trapping claw on it.

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,280
It would swoop down and grab me.

153
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
And as I flew away, Darcy Cardin would wave

154
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
to the helicopter and be like, thank you.

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,680
Thank you, you ate all the hot dogs.

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,040
He ate all the hot dogs.

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,160
We saw so many, guys, this was a wild one.

158
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
This was a wild week.

159
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
I hope this doesn't come off as bragging.

160
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
No, we did not belong.

161
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
We did not belong there.

162
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,880
We were like the kids in the mix of files

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,400
of Mrs. Batesley, Frank Weiler.

164
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,560
We were hiding in the museum just hoping the security guards

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,440
did not catch us as we ate from the vending machines

166
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,480
to stay alive.

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Dad added a fun layer of difficulty to it.

168
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, we played hard mode.

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,760
Dad, we did play hard mode, new game plots,

170
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,360
because Dad has a tic, which makes him, legally,

171
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,040
whenever he sees a famous person,

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,160
he has to loudly announce their name

173
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,920
or a role that they're well known for.

174
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
And there's fucking Ducky!

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
Yeah, right, yeah, Dad's four feet away from you.

176
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,040
Now, to our credit, and I think that this is a testament today,

177
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
did not say there's Ducky.

178
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,720
He said, I wonder if he's still bald

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
because he played Lex Luthor.

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah, that's what he said about John Crier.

181
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
And then John Crier turned around and said,

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,280
yeah, that's great, Clint.

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,000
And then once we got inside the very crowded party,

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
Dad would just go somewhere.

185
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,960
That would just tell what they're off.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,320
And we would have to find Dad,

187
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
because he can't, y'all, he can't party anymore.

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,400
He can't party like Ducky do.

189
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
I will say this.

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,840
So Dad introduced himself to Brandon Routh,

191
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
one of the Superman's.

192
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
And then later in the evening,

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,960
our friend Sarah Benincasa introduced me to Brandon Routh,

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,200
and Brandon Routh said, oh, that was your dad.

195
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
And like, remembered our father.

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
He gets Sarah for you, and there's two places

197
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
where Travis is known as Max Kidd.

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,120
It's Huntington and Brandon Routh's house.

199
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,520
Oh, yeah, you know my friend, your dad.

200
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
Apparently, Dad told me later that Brandon Routh said to him,

201
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
like, are you an actor?

202
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
And Dad explained all of his stage work

203
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,440
in Huntington, West Virginia.

204
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Fuck, yeah.

205
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes, see, that rules.

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
I wish I had the spiritual confidence of my father.

207
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,960
But I mean, like, the whole thing was weird.

208
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,360
I guess it's all thank you to everybody

209
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
who came out to, like, all our signings

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,840
and bought our new book, The Avenger Zone,

211
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
or on the Rockport Limited,

212
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
and came to all our events and shows.

213
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,280
Like, that's the, you're the, you are our only,

214
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,200
you're like our cool friend that gets us into parties.

215
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
Like, I don't know, a bunch of other people know

216
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
who these guys are, because we certainly don't.

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
So we appreciate it.

218
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
Thank you for making all our lives so strange.

219
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
It feels increasingly like a dare,

220
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,880
but holy fuck.

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
They haven't chickened out yet.

222
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Let's see, I don't know.

223
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Maybe we'll invite them to, I don't know,

224
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
another party with, like, two John Criers

225
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
and see if they get the hint this time.

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Just want to say this world is bullshit, you know?

227
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,120
This is the world of fame?

228
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Fiona Apple, I just wanted to get out there

229
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
and say, like, it was a fine party.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
The hot dogs were just scrumptious,

231
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
but this whole world is bullshit,

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
and don't let anybody tell you who to be,

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
like Fiona Apple said once.

234
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,080
Wow, that's beautiful.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
But Griffin, what if I want to be,

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
like, a hobnobbing celebrity?

237
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
That doesn't, that's, then you're bullshit.

238
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh no, ow!

239
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,680
When John Crier came over, he was like,

240
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,040
hey, I met some of your families.

241
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,400
I hear you do a podcast.

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,280
That sounds really interesting.

243
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
You know, I used to play, and I'm like,

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
bullshit, dude!

245
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,360
Bullshit!

246
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,160
Hey, somebody come get Ducky.

247
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
Brandon Routh is like, hey, me and your brother

248
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
are literally going out for hamburgers.

249
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
Bullshit, bud!

250
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
I've seen through your lies, Superman!

251
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
And when Melissa Fumero was like,

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,280
oh, it's so nice to meet you,

253
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,600
I was like, yeah, it's nice to meet you as well.

254
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm a huge fan, and you're super nice.

255
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,960
See, he's bullshit, Justin.

256
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,600
Not like us.

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,160
He's falling in.

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
Sheep and wolf's clothing.

259
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
I, when I met, when I met Ashton,

260
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,840
I said, who are you in Lion King?

261
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
And he said, I wasn't in Lion King.

262
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,960
I said, then what fucking good are ya?

263
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,400
I wandered away.

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,720
No, that was good.

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,080
And he knew who had the power

266
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
in that relationship, for sure.

267
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
That was a good one.

268
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
That was good.

269
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
I asked everybody what they thought of Lion King

270
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,800
or if they were in it.

271
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
That's the only people I wanted to talk to

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
is people who had seen Lion King

273
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
or performed in the film Lion King.

274
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
The guy did Moana, the musical guy.

275
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,640
He came over and I was like, were you in Lion King?

276
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
And he's like, Justin, we've been friends for years.

277
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
It's like, I don't have any friends

278
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,600
that didn't work on Lion King.

279
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,480
Yeah, that was true.

280
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
He started crying.

281
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,560
He started crying.

282
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,200
Yeah, he was hurt.

283
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,960
Because actually, I was like,

284
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
Lion King's the only part of this whole,

285
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,320
and I pointed to everybody at the party,

286
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
world that isn't bullshit.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
It's the only legit one.

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,320
And then Seth Rogen was like, I was in Lion King.

289
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,080
And that's when dad started screaming,

290
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
are you Nathan Lane?

291
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,480
Are you Nathan Lane?

292
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Like in his face over and over again.

293
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
And they pushed him over the balcony.

294
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
I do want to say one other thing about this

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
before we move on for this intolerable section

296
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
of the podcast.

297
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,440
At a separate after party event

298
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
that was not really a party,

299
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
but was just a bunch of us sitting around at a bar,

300
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,120
Griffin did, during a particularly heated round of Uno,

301
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,520
hadouken an entire beer onto Lin-Manuel Miranda's pants.

302
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,920
Which I mention only because

303
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
it's the exact thing you're worried about

304
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
happening at these other parts.

305
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,720
Like, you're not gonna do something worse than that.

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,840
Like, the worst thing had already happened to you,

307
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,240
which you spin kicked an entire beer

308
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
onto this poor gentleman.

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
I didn't, it wasn't a hadouken.

310
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
It wasn't a hadouken.

311
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,840
It was a closed fist punch into a beer glass

312
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,920
because I got excited about a card I had to play.

313
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
And there it is, there's the truth.

314
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,960
And like, we squashed that beef right away.

315
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
We traded pants.

316
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,280
Okay.

317
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,400
Okay, moving on.

318
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
This is an advice show.

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,640
It's not just a San Diego Comic-Con recap.

320
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,440
A famous.

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Nothing you just heard was a brag.

322
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
It killed all of us a little bit except Travis.

323
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
Even, no, even I was not bragging.

324
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,080
I have been in a cocoon for the last like three days.

325
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah.

326
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,400
Just recovering from having to talk to so many people.

327
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,640
Travis did force himself into a picture with Kristen Bell

328
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,600
and came back to us and was doubled over

329
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,520
with the exhaustion of the effort.

330
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,280
It took all of his power.

331
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,160
Or maybe Kristen is a Shang Tsung

332
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,320
and just got a little bit of that soul.

333
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,400
Just got it, pulled it right in.

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,320
If so, she's welcome to it.

335
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,640
She knows she's given us all so much.

336
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,080
Eat my soul, Kristen Bell.

337
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Yes, it's an advice show.

338
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,680
And we help you, the listener, with your queries.

339
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,320
You can send those because I don't think we've mentioned this

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
in a couple of years.

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,400
You can send those to mbmbam at maximumfund.org.

342
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Real queries for advice only, please.

343
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm a pizza delivery driver.

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
And every time I deliver to a certain bar in town,

345
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
they tell me I have to dance or they aren't going to tip me.

346
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,280
I really need the money, so I humored them the first time

347
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,800
and now they ask every time.

348
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
And I deliver there twice a week.

349
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,520
How do I get them to stop asking me to dance?

350
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,200
Is there any way I can get a tip without dancing?

351
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
And that's from Ben Vereen.

352
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
No, mine would have made a lot of sense.

353
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520
That would have made a lot of sense.

354
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,480
It's from Two-Stepping in Texas and not Ben Vereen.

355
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,880
Yeah.

356
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah, I think this is the wildest and worst bar.

357
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,160
This is a bad bar.

358
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
That's what it says outside.

359
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,160
It's a two-step bar, so they probably play it off

360
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,960
like they're chill.

361
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
Like, hey, come on in.

362
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Now honky-tonk, ba-donk-a-donk.

363
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
And step this way and then this way.

364
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
And that's apparently dancing.

365
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Now you do it or else we will suspend your ability

366
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
to pay bills this month.

367
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,000
It seems like this is like one step removed from like

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
the outlaw gang in town firing their pistol at your feet

369
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,640
to make you dance.

370
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah, it's a lot like-

371
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,400
You want this $3, you're gonna have to dance.

372
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me ask you a question.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,760
Every time you pull up to this bar,

374
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,040
do you knock over all of the motorcycles lined up outside

375
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,640
and then you do it as a sort of distraction

376
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,000
to save your hiney?

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
This makes sense.

378
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
I've seen this before.

379
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,240
Yes, that makes sense to me.

380
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
I just don't dance, like the next-

381
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
Listen, you gotta pull that bandaid off

382
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,840
and then we're like, you got a chance for this tip.

383
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
You say, no, I don't.

384
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm an adult.

385
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,680
And then just-

386
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
That doesn't sound like the kind of person

387
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
you want to party with.

388
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah, I want to be able to party with my pizza delivery.

389
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,640
Or maybe just say like, my boss said

390
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

391
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,080
My doctor said I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

392
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,040
I have a condition where I'm not allowed to dance.

393
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,400
John Lithgow said I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

394
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,280
In town, if you want to leave the town, I can go.

395
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
Or if you know Kevin Bacon,

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,640
I could probably make some arrangements.

397
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,120
You could wear your cleats inside.

398
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
Ah, fuck.

399
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,200
The cleats.

400
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
I can't.

401
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,880
Oh, I didn't know.

402
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,160
Ah, shoot.

403
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,920
I just came from my big game.

404
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,040
And before you ask, I won the kick.

405
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,480
And yeah, I did have a pretty special touchdown dance.

406
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,040
I did for-

407
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,680
Ah, damn it.

408
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,280
Okay, fine, you can see it.

409
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
Yes, let's go outside.

410
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
I'll do my special touchdown dance.

411
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
And then you've made it worse.

412
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
At that point, it's worse because now you have to come up

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,560
with a special touchdown dance outside in your cleats.

414
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Maybe you get the first move.

415
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,920
You get the upper hand and you say,

416
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,200
do you want this pizza?

417
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
You're gonna have to sing for it.

418
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,120
Ah, okay.

419
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,360
And then when they're like, that's ridiculous.

420
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm paying for it.

421
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
Then you be like, yes, thank you.

422
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Now we're on the same page.

423
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
You take the pizza and give me extra money, please.

424
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
Just like I gave you extra cheese,

425
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,960
you give me extra money.

426
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
This is obviously untenable,

427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,480
but I am very glad that you mentioned that it is two-step,

428
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
which is a fairly harmless dance.

429
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,800
Because if you hadn't included the genre of dance,

430
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,040
my worst fear would be like,

431
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,960
yeah, go make it clap out on the floor.

432
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,160
And then we'll see.

433
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,800
Then we'll see.

434
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,440
This is a miserable tip.

435
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Make that booty clap.

436
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
Fucking tip everyone.

437
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
Tip everyone.

438
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
100% of the price of the meal every time.

439
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
This is the new rule.

440
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,680
It's rough out there.

441
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,800
Tipping rules are easy.

442
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,520
Now you just have to put exactly what the thing cost

443
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,320
for everything that you purchased and every service,

444
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
you tip 100% perfect.

445
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,280
Easy.

446
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
Easy to remember, easy to abide by.

447
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
It's the same number.

448
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
It's just the same number.

449
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
And then when the revolution comes,

450
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
it's all gonna work out, baby.

451
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Don't worry about it.

452
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,360
And listen, this is just a helpful tip from me to you

453
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
who I've been a delivery driver at different places.

454
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
Tipping cash because they have to pay for their own gasoline.

455
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Yeah, baby.

456
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
But then once the revolution comes,

457
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,600
that cash is just gonna be stinky, dirty paper.

458
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,320
Right.

459
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Correct.

460
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
Then you're gonna want to start paying with credit card.

461
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,400
I have a Yahoo here.

462
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
Can I read it?

463
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,480
Yeah, bud.

464
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,280
It's from Graham.

465
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
Roboc sent it in.

466
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,720
Thanks, Graham.

467
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,600
It's Yahoo answers you.

468
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,320
They're anonymous.

469
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
Chelsea asks,

470
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,520
how do I remind myself to eat more kale?

471
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,000
I blank, I'll fill it in here.

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
I fucking used to love kale.

473
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,120
That's it.

474
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,400
What happened?

475
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,200
What did happen?

476
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
I've had situations.

477
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,520
When I was a kid, I stayed at granny's house

478
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,600
and I had myself a bean lunch

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,680
and then I got sick in the toilet.

480
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
A wet sickness.

481
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
Do you know what I'm talking about?

482
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,880
Yes.

483
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
And then I didn't eat.

484
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,680
Yes, sir.

485
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,640
I didn't eat beans for like, no joke,

486
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
six or seven years after that

487
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,240
because I thought I was allergic to beans.

488
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
People would ask me, do you have any allergies?

489
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
And I would say, well, yes, I do.

490
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Beans.

491
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
And they would say, are you positive?

492
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
And then I would tell them the story

493
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,920
that preceded this explanation.

494
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,200
Griffin, that's wild.

495
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah.

496
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
That's wild.

497
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
If you have a bad food time,

498
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
you don't want to eat that food again.

499
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,560
That's what I'm saying.

500
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,760
But that's not the same as being allergic to a food.

501
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,960
No, I know.

502
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,600
I was wrong.

503
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,720
I'm not allergic to beans.

504
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
Now I bean it up all the fucking, all day long.

505
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,400
Yeah.

506
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
Get off my thing.

507
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
Get back onto the question.

508
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
Okay, so you're thinking that this person

509
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
ate a kale lunch and had a bathroom, uh-oh.

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,320
Had a wet sick, yeah.

511
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,440
And that made them like stop eating kale

512
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
and then they just went like,

513
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
oh man, I should eat some kale again.

514
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
But every time the opportunity for kale arises,

515
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
they just forget.

516
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,560
They eat something else.

517
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Oh, they forget about kale.

518
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, you can't look at life through the lens

519
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
of every meal is an opportunity for kale

520
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
because you will absolutely just wear yourself down

521
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,160
to the bone like that.

522
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,200
Yeah, you miss 100% of the kales you don't eat.

523
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,760
That's, yeah.

524
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,480
That's what Brinsky said.

525
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
And that's why he was so fucking yoked all the time.

526
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah, also regular as shit.

527
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,920
A little too regular maybe even.

528
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,280
Couldn't make it through a game.

529
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah.

530
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,320
This person fucking-

531
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
That was his undoing.

532
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,400
I fucking used to love kale.

533
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
How can I remind myself to eat more kale?

534
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
Tie some kale around your finger.

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,520
That's a good one, Trav, thank you.

536
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,160
That's pretty good.

537
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Kale shirt.

538
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
Can't get into bed wearing that.

539
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,120
Maybe like hang some kale from the ceiling

541
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,680
that you have to walk through to get to bed

542
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,160
and then just-

543
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,480
They should have kale barriers on stuff.

544
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,800
Yeah.

545
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,320
Like if you had a kale rope tied around every toilet

546
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,400
that you had to gnaw your way through

547
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
before you could use the bathroom, I love that.

548
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Just a big sheet of kale over the bathroom door

549
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
that you have to eat your way through

550
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
like you're in Metroid.

551
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes, hire a company to kidnap you and bury you in kale

552
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,320
and you have to eat your way out.

553
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,480
It's good too.

554
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,040
If Mark Summers would just put the flag

555
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,640
in a big pile of kale

556
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
and you had to eat your way into the pile

557
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,840
to win double there,

558
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
I feel like that is something.

559
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,680
Welcome to super healthy, super clean double dare.

560
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,000
First, you're gonna go through this bath

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,680
and then you're gonna eat some kale

562
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,240
and get in some jammies and go to bed.

563
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,200
Now listen, it's gonna get-

564
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Point of order, it will get super sloppy.

565
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,200
Just not during the show.

566
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,680
Yes.

567
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,600
Post-show is going to be an unfortunate sloppy situation.

568
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,840
Yeah.

569
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,920
At double dare after dark.

570
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,720
Double dare nights.

571
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
I wish there was such a thing

572
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,880
and bear with me here, fellas,

573
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,360
because it's gonna-

574
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,400
As double dare nights,

575
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
detective show starring Mark Summers.

576
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,240
Yes.

577
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,760
Looks like this one got a little too sloppy.

578
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,680
He shoots someone in the head,

579
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,400
he's like, I'm sending you to space camp.

580
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,480
This is gonna get kind of cerebral.

581
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Okay.

582
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,040
I wish there was such a thing as an edible tattoo.

583
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay.

584
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
Well, I'm getting comfy.

585
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Okay, go on Wonka.

586
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,120
It is kind of Wonka-esque,

587
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,840
but if you like kale,

588
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,240
if you were to ask me,

589
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,640
Griffin, sit down in front of a Google doc

590
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
and type out every kind of food that you like,

591
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,960
I would get the easy stuff first.

592
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
Pizza, taco, meatballs.

593
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,240
But then if you asked me to keep going,

594
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,640
I like broccoli, okay.

595
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
A list, a ranking even of my favorite foods,

596
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,800
I couldn't do it.

597
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,880
And so what if every time you tried something

598
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,800
and you were like, oh my God, what is that?

599
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,360
And somebody's like, that is ceviche, my man.

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
I'll be like, get out the pen.

601
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
And then I would tattoo it in my arm.

602
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
So anytime I got hungry, I could look down

603
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
and be like, ooh, what is that?

604
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
Oh, that's right, ceviche.

605
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
What did ceviche taste like?

606
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
And then you give it a little.

607
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,360
I think you're really close to auto cannibalism, Griffin.

608
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,240
No, you don't eat it.

609
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,800
You don't eat it.

610
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,360
You don't eat it.

611
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,920
You don't eat it.

612
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,400
You lick it.

613
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
You understand.

614
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,840
You understand that you have gone into human evolution

615
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,320
and have basically replaced memory,

616
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
our ability to remember, with a fun fruit snack

617
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,520
for the whole family.

618
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,080
Not a fruit.

619
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,280
This is what you're saying.

620
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,960
You're trading memory for the ability to eat your own flesh.

621
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,560
No, I'm saying you trade off.

622
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,200
Now I don't have to keep my favorite foods inside my brain.

623
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
I keep that on my arm.

624
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
Now my brain has more room for the 800 Pokemon that exist.

625
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
And we can get super hyper concentrated flavor ink, right?

626
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,240
And you'll be like, yeah, let me get ceviche,

627
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,920
but do it in ceviche flavored ink.

628
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,040
And so they would do it

629
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,720
and it would be really fucking concentrated.

630
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
So it lasts a long time,

631
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,600
but you will have to get a re-up every like three months or so.

632
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Now, how do you decide-

633
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,680
We all assumed flavoring, Griffin.

634
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
I mean, we all assumed that.

635
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,600
That was obvious.

636
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,920
Yeah, how do you determine,

637
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,160
like how much do you have to like a food

638
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,360
for it to, is it like the more you like a food,

639
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,720
the bigger the tattoo is?

640
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
Does every food get a spot or is it like-

641
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,680
I think it's gotta be quick, right?

642
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,400
I think every restaurant has to offer the tattoo service.

643
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh, but that's awkward.

644
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,280
They're gonna come over and be like,

645
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,000
so do you want a tattoo of our world famous fries or not?

646
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
But you didn't like the fries.

647
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,400
I didn't.

648
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
The truffle oil wasn't, no.

649
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,040
So no tattoo for me, you think?

650
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,120
No, I think the tattoo would be extremely rare.

651
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
Somebody eats these truffle fries and they go, yummy!

652
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
Hey!

653
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,760
And then they just bring out the whole cart

654
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,160
and get them going and get it on the arm.

655
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,440
I think it doesn't have to go on the arm,

656
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
but it does have to go on a lickable body part.

657
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,160
Yeah, it can't be the elbow or like the ear lobe.

658
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,320
Yeah, or your own butt.

659
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,160
You can't lick your own butt?

660
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,320
Haven't tried.

661
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,760
Do it now.

662
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,200
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

663
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,160
Well, I can't eat ass while I podcast, Trav.

664
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,760
Fucking eat ass while you podcast seems like a t-shirt.

665
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
It should have a big fucking eagle on it

666
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,120
and you a rad thumbs up.

667
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,880
Or it could be like the keep calm and carry on,

668
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:18,960
which says eat ass and podcast.

669
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,080
Big Dogs is back with a thrilling new line.

670
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Oh, shit.

671
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,920
That's our new podcast merch is just gonna be

672
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,520
Big Dogs inspired collection.

673
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh my God.

674
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Holy shit.

675
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Should we do one more little question?

676
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah, I got one here for you.

677
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,800
My partner and I are out for dinner at a local pizzeria.

678
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,480
This is our second pizza themed question.

679
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,720
Listen, sometimes I put together a question list

680
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
when I'm hungry, okay?

681
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,160
We don't need to identify that.

682
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,280
Okay, so the place is somewhat trendy

683
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,000
and caters to young hip clientele.

684
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,360
We've already ordered

685
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
and we're told it might be a 30 minute wait.

686
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,560
The people at the table next to us just left,

687
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,840
leaving behind three untouched slices of pepperoni pizza.

688
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
No, next question.

689
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,040
No, next question.

690
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,880
My partner and I are both quite hungry.

691
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
It's a busy night.

692
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,760
We would almost certainly be seen by other diners

693
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,640
if we went for it.

694
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,520
Should we grab the pizza

695
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
before someone comes to clear the table?

696
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
And that's from Pining for Pizza in Little Rock.

697
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,800
And they have decided to solve this immediate problem

698
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,680
by sending an email to a weekly podcast.

699
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,360
And I salute you for that.

700
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,320
Now, first and foremost,

701
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,600
I wanna go ahead and get out of the way.

702
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Food waste is a real issue in our country.

703
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
Thank you, yes Travis.

704
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,040
Why is it weird to eat that pizza

705
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,720
that no one else is gonna take on the table?

706
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,400
It's not suddenly,

707
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,240
like if they were still sitting there

708
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,880
and they picked,

709
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,400
like the people who are at that table,

710
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,160
picked up one of those three slices,

711
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,920
no one else in the restaurant would be like,

712
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,840
ew, but if you reach across a two foot gap

713
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
to grab that piece of pizza,

714
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
you're a monster.

715
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
You have to assume,

716
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,440
okay, I wanna take the social thing out of it.

717
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,080
I always, everyone is always assuming

718
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,040
that they're fucking up.

719
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
And everyone also assumes,

720
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
the assumption that everyone makes

721
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,000
is that everyone else knows what they're doing.

722
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,520
And it's a faulty supposition,

723
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,040
but it's one we're constantly making

724
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,560
on a subconscious basis.

725
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,680
You have to work extremely hard

726
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,480
to make people think you don't know what you're doing.

727
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,360
If you walk over and you pick up some za off a table

728
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
that was abandoned by some other people,

729
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
everyone will just assume you're doing it.

730
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,400
Assume it was agreed upon beforehand,

731
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
like they texted you,

732
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
they're your cousin,

733
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,040
it could be anything.

734
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,760
Everyone will just take that aspect out of it.

735
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,240
So then we're left with like a hygiene question, right?

736
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,640
That is, that I think is more debatable.

737
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,680
No, I mean, hygiene is not a question for me.

738
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,560
Hygiene is not a question.

739
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,760
This is good pizza, folks.

740
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,360
This is good pizza, folks.

741
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,840
It's not like they slobbered all over it.

742
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,480
Maybe they did,

743
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,160
but you gotta just sort of play the odds

744
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,200
when you're doing stuff like this.

745
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,280
Food waste is a problem, Travis, yes.

746
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
And we are basically,

747
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
we're all basically already a bunch of just dirty dogs.

748
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
So just go for it.

749
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,360
Go for it.

750
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,160
Go eat this.

751
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
And if somebody gets on you,

752
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
just like throw them a newspaper and say,

753
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
we're all already dirty dogs.

754
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,920
So it really doesn't matter anymore.

755
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,800
Are you throwing the newspaper in like a fetch kind of way?

756
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,520
It can be a joke like that, yeah.

757
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
But they do need to read it

758
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
and then read it front to back.

759
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,640
And I don't know where you live,

760
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
but you're gonna make it to the end of that newspaper

761
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
and be like, damn, we're all dirty dogs.

762
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,760
So it doesn't matter if you eat the scraps, does it?

763
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,560
Well, I think the only concern would be

764
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
that you might get asked to leave the restaurant,

765
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,440
but I also don't think anyone working at the restaurant

766
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,120
would want to do that.

767
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Like they'd have to walk over and say,

768
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,400
did you eat the pizza at that table?

769
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
And you would say, no.

770
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
And they would say, okay.

771
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,840
And then they'd leave you alone

772
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
because that is as much confrontation

773
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
as any human being ever wants.

774
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,640
Now, unless they, unless,

775
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
sorry, I gave you the window.

776
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
Oh, unless.

777
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,520
Justin, you're still there.

778
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,080
You gotta leave.

779
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,600
You can't leave me with unsatisfied.

780
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,480
Unless they wanted to eat that pizza in the secret back.

781
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
Now that is the thing.

782
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,400
And that's the thing.

783
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,280
Juice, when you worked at the OG,

784
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,320
were you snarfing down soup salad,

785
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
bread bowl, breadstick, whatever?

786
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,200
I got hired at the OG as a dishwasher.

787
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,760
So yes.

788
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,240
And I went back to meet the man who would be training me.

789
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,920
I watched him pick up a cup of minestrone off a plate

790
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,000
and fucking jam it like a shooter.

791
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,760
And then he asked, what department are you working in?

792
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
And I said, I'm a line chef.

793
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,840
Yes.

794
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,800
Yes.

795
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,640
Because I couldn't study under this man,

796
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,920
even though I celebrate him for that.

797
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
I couldn't live up to this person.

798
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,440
So I lied and said I'd been hired as a chef.

799
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
And that's how I got to be a chef at the Olive Garden.

800
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,960
That anecdote I've told probably 30 times.

801
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,520
I've never gotten more than a polite chuckle.

802
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,680
But I submit that if I did become a chef in my life,

803
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,520
after that, it would be an extremely good story.

804
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:31,840
Yes.

805
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,320
Yeah.

806
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,560
Yes.

807
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm just saying the value of the story is diminished

808
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
because I worked there for a month and quit

809
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
because I was tired of stinking of garlic.

810
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,880
You smelled so bad.

811
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,680
You smelled like fucking Van Helsing.

812
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,080
You smelled so much of the garlic.

813
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,680
I would like to pitch a new idea.

814
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,000
I recently, while in San Diego, went to a breakfast place

815
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,800
and I got some pancakes and as is always the case,

816
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,360
they brought me three huge flappy jacks

817
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,040
and I only wanted one.

818
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,760
And I kept thinking I should have asked around first

819
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
to see if anyone around me was thinking

820
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
of ordering the same pancakes.

821
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
And I could have just like, I don't know,

822
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,520
ride shared these pancakes with people sitting around me

823
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,080
and said like, I only want one of these three.

824
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
Does anybody else just want to go ahead

825
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,920
and eat one of the other ones?

826
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,200
And then I don't have to feel bad about ordering them.

827
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I'm saying maybe we ride share pancakes from now on.

828
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
And pizza too, something that comes in easily dividable.

829
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,400
You know, like, let's, hey, when you're here, your family,

830
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,280
let's treat it like family and share fucking pancakes

831
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,200
and pizza, but just that.

832
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,360
Let's take a break from this.

833
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,080
Thank God.

834
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
It's all very good.

835
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,160
I love this.

836
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,680
But let's take a break to talk about the money.

837
00:32:47,680 --> 00:33:01,840
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

838
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,320
Who's there?

839
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,640
Who's there?

840
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,920
Whoa.

841
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,040
I should have let you do it.

842
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,880
Yeah, were you calling yourself?

843
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,840
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

844
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,280
Don't answer it.

845
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,440
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

846
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
It's him again.

847
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,520
No, it's him again.

848
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,360
Oh no, this is a, sorry, this is a doorbell.

849
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,680
Well, they're just ringing it in a pattern

850
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,120
that makes it sound like a telephone.

851
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,560
Okay, try it again.

852
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,960
We'll get it.

853
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,080
Yeah, we'll get it this time.

854
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

855
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,160
No, thank you.

856
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,840
We're good.

857
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,560
Thank you.

858
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,880
Why don't you look at the app and see the camera

859
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
and see who it is?

860
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,200
I did.

861
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,920
And it was you.

862
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,360
So you were dismissed.

863
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,960
We sent you straight to voice mail, which is the modern sort

864
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,920
of fun, kinky way of saying we didn't answer the door.

865
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,000
All right, well, I guess I'll take this big briefcase

866
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,040
full of money and cereal somewhere else.

867
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,960
Ooh, I use the ring.

868
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
Ring is a magical doorbell that goes in the front of your door.

869
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,680
And no one knows how it works and no one knows how it works,

870
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,920
but it has AC video and two way audio.

871
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,840
You can set motion detection.

872
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,880
Someone showed up in front door.

873
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,600
You're not only going to get a notification that they're there.

874
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,520
You're going to be able to pop the camera open and see like,

875
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,200
what do you want?

876
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
What are you doing?

877
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
Who is that right now?

878
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,520
If you're out and about, I've answered my door from across

879
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,000
the country before and said, just leave the weed under the map.

880
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,440
One thing that I like about it is that if there's,

881
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,040
I'll just say shit going down in your neighborhood,

882
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,400
there are these neighborhood safety alerts where you see like,

883
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,960
hey, a bunch of people are getting robbed over here.

884
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,440
You should try to stay cool.

885
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,200
Try to be cool about it and not tell the cops.

886
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
No, you can't tell.

887
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
You should tell the cops.

888
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,200
But like, you get those sorts of neighborhood safety alerts.

889
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,480
They got a deal for our listeners.

890
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,560
If you go to ring.com slash my brother,

891
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,080
you can get a special deal on a ring starter kit,

892
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,080
which is the video doorbell and motion activated floodlight camera.

893
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,240
You can get that starter kit and save like 50 bucks,

894
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,240
which is awesome.

895
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,680
And if you want to get some more equipment,

896
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,400
you can also save more at ring.com slash my brother.

897
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,640
I use the thing literally every day.

898
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
It is the best.

899
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,240
And it is available for you now at ring.com slash my brother.

900
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
Gonna tell you about Blue Apron now.

901
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
So here it comes.

902
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,600
This is the cooking box.

903
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,280
It's gonna have lots of stuff in it

904
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
and you're gonna be confused by it.

905
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,360
Why did I just get a big thing of asparagus and meat?

906
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,240
Don't freak out.

907
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,880
Look at the box.

908
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,840
It says Blue Apron on it.

909
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,720
That's how you know that the payload has been delivered.

910
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
It's not a threat.

911
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
It's not a threat.

912
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
This is what I'm going to do to you.

913
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
It is a box that gives you that,

914
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,480
those ingredients exclusively meat and asparagus only

915
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,160
and then it teaches you how to use it

916
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,920
in all kinds of different ways.

917
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
That's one of my favorite things about Blue Apron.

918
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
It gives you all the ingredients you need,

919
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
none that you don't.

920
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,840
There's never like, what?

921
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
There's just a zucchini in here.

922
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,920
What do I do with it?

923
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,440
A fucking golf ball in here.

924
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,400
Zucchini is neither meat nor asparagus.

925
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,280
And those are the two things that are available

926
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,680
in every Blue Apron box and only those two things.

927
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,040
Now here's what's going to throw you.

928
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,080
They have started offering the Beyond Burger,

929
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,240
which is a plant-based patty, right?

930
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,800
So you're going to be like, wait, is this the burger

931
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,160
or is this the asparagus?

932
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,440
And you'll never know.

933
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,600
Yeah, yeah, it's confusing.

934
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,800
So anyway, they make cooking a sustainable part

935
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,080
of your weekly routine and all their meals

936
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,440
are carefully designed and tested

937
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,640
by the Test Kitchen chefs.

938
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
Boy, I bet that's a good job,

939
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,400
snacking around on these good burgers and stuff.

940
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,880
They use unique specialty ingredients

941
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,200
to bring chef quality recipes to your dinner table.

942
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,080
We've all used it.

943
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,120
I learned how to cook from it.

944
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,280
It's really, it's the jam.

945
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,240
It's the shit.

946
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,440
Here's some recipes.

947
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
Cajun shrimp and corn pancakes

948
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
with sauteed summer vegetables.

949
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
Don't mind if I yum.

950
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
Steaks and sauteed vegetables

951
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,120
with cheesy mashed potatoes.

952
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,680
Can't guarantee that those are asparagus.

953
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,120
I'm looking, they're green and long.

954
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,720
So maybe, maybe.

955
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,120
Anyway, if you want to start making delicious

956
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
brag-worthy meals at home without-

957
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,880
They also have stuff that are like non-meat based,

958
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
just too, just throwing that out.

959
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
You know, yellow tomato and zucchini pasta.

960
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,240
Griffin just chose to list off

961
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
two of the like eight different options

962
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,760
that both contained meat,

963
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
but there are non-meat options.

964
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,960
They look badass.

965
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,720
You can check out this week's menu

966
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
and get $60 off when you visit

967
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,440
blueapron.com slash my brother.

968
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

969
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

970
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,200
Hi, I'm Dave.

971
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,160
Hi, I'm Graham.

972
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,400
And we're two house DJs

973
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

974
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,280
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by

975
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,120
and visited us every week

976
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,960
on Stop Podcasting Yourself

977
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
here on MaximumFun.org.

978
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada

979
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
and listen to our show or perish.

980
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
Stop podcasting yourself

981
00:37:49,280 --> 00:38:02,960
on MaximumFun.org.

982
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,600
My lord.

983
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,960
I, yay verily, want too much.

984
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,260
Huzzah!

985
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,160
I, yay verily, want too much.

986
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,460
Huzzah!

987
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,500
It's a Ren Faire version

988
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,700
of the Munch Squad theme song.

989
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,980
It's a podcast within a podcast.

990
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
Usually I read press releases

991
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,580
before I do them

992
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,900
and I'm gonna roll a cosmic dice here

993
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,300
on this episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me

994
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
and tell you about Taco Bell

995
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,700
revealing spicy details

996
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,140
of its new pop-up hotel.

997
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,900
Oh my god.

998
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,400
Okay.

999
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,340
So yeah, so they're getting in the hotels

1000
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,140
with, it's called the Bell.

1001
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,780
Now we've definitely not talked about this before

1002
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,900
because god that's weird.

1003
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,580
Yeah, no.

1004
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,780
I mean we may have mentioned it

1005
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,260
but we didn't have these fucking spicy details,

1006
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Trav.

1007
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,140
The Bell.

1008
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,700
Okay.

1009
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,300
A Taco Bell hotel and resort

1010
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,060
opening in Palm Springs in August.

1011
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,940
It's a limited time experience

1012
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,500
but as this press release certainly reminds me

1013
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,100
all things are limited time

1014
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,180
and this is a great application

1015
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,580
of the time that you have on earth

1016
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,340
is to go to the Taco Bell hotel

1017
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,820
which is called the Bell.

1018
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,660
Available for a limited time.

1019
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,020
What is gonna make the Bell

1020
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,820
such an incredible experience?

1021
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,180
Is that what I hear you asking?

1022
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,340
What are your top questions about the Bell?

1023
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,180
Are you asking us?

1024
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,140
Oh yeah, no.

1025
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,340
Hey, it was kind of rhetorical

1026
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,540
but I was also curious.

1027
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,060
Are there on-site restaurants?

1028
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes, thank you.

1029
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
The food, yes.

1030
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,340
Yes, here's what's gonna be the best Taco Bell

1031
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,100
and there's also an unexpected take

1032
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,940
on a resort poolside menu.

1033
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,820
I guess unexpected when you're staying

1034
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,620
at the Taco Bell hotel means not Taco Bell.

1035
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,780
So there's the two things you could do there

1036
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,740
at Taco Bell and not Taco Bell.

1037
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,060
So you're looking at maybe a toasted cheddar club

1038
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,860
with hand-breaded crispy chicken, jalapeno, bacon, avocado,

1039
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,220
sharp cheddar, it doesn't matter.

1040
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,620
Or an avocado tostada served on local multi-grain toast

1041
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,860
with avocado breakfast radish.

1042
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,020
So this press release is bold enough

1043
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,900
to imagine a world where I would be the sort of person

1044
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,980
that would go to the Taco Bell hotel

1045
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,660
and then say, excuse me, is this spread local?

1046
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,700
Mm-hmm, excuse me, is this local multi-grain toast

1047
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,060
from the region?

1048
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,540
But it also implies that there is a person who's like,

1049
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,060
I'm gonna go out of my way to stay at the Taco Bell hotel

1050
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,780
but I don't like Taco Bell food.

1051
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,780
It's just closest to my convention.

1052
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,580
Think outside the bun, purchase local.

1053
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,340
So there's gonna be a Baja Blast birthday freeze

1054
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,620
celebrating the 15th anniversary.

1055
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,260
It's gonna be served in the first ever freeze lounge

1056
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,100
to keep things chill.

1057
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,860
So I guess this is a very cold lounge,

1058
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,180
perfect for enjoying the Baja Blast.

1059
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,820
I would argue we already have those

1060
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,260
and they're called Morgues.

1061
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,100
But there will be an onsite morgue perfect

1062
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,780
for enjoying a Baja Blast.

1063
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,900
Fantastic, here's a quote, I got a quote.

1064
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,100
All right.

1065
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,260
It's from Rene Piscotti.

1066
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,740
He's the executive chef of the Bell.

1067
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,020
They have one of those?

1068
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,820
Hell yeah.

1069
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,300
Let's be honest, let's be honest,

1070
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,260
food is the best part of traveling.

1071
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,500
A lot of effort and homework goes into finding out

1072
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,220
the best places to eat near where you're staying.

1073
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,340
What is this accent?

1074
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,900
I love it.

1075
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,820
It's Rene Piscotti.

1076
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,260
But with the Bell, we thought of everything for you.

1077
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,780
You mean Taco Bell food?

1078
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,460
From welcome beverages to room service

1079
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,660
to build your own breakfast tacos

1080
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,340
and surprises throughout.

1081
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,820
What?

1082
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,780
Whoa, wait, hold on.

1083
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,740
You can't just say surprises throughout.

1084
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,260
Surprises without.

1085
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,500
Many of which feature local ingredients

1086
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,540
like our horchata date smoothie.

1087
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,620
We're curating the ultimate Taco Bell food experience.

1088
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,260
So the Bell is a hotel that has the bravery

1089
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,380
to look at the Taco Bell menu and say,

1090
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,660
well, certainly not this.

1091
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,860
Certainly you didn't intend on consuming this.

1092
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,700
Do you guys know what a,

1093
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,860
I think it's pronounced Hallow Klein is?

1094
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,020
No.

1095
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,660
This is when usually in like an underwater cave

1096
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,340
like really salty salt water and fresh water

1097
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,980
like refuse to mix.

1098
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,460
And so it creates like a visible surface

1099
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,500
from one water to the other that you can see.

1100
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,020
And I'm wondering if there's one of these

1101
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,900
at the front door of the Taco Bell hotel

1102
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,420
because of how many farts,

1103
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,700
like concentrated condensed like fart air

1104
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,860
is in there that you literally can see

1105
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,140
like a visible air surface.

1106
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,820
Yes, welcome to the hotel.

1107
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,780
I do have to warn you, our air is flavor blasted.

1108
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,700
So you're going to need to wear this special diving mask.

1109
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,300
It's local farts.

1110
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,860
Farts, locally sourced farts.

1111
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,620
These are farm to table farts.

1112
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,660
The fun, the fun you ask?

1113
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,020
Well, they've got the fun.

1114
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,780
While daytime DJs play jams,

1115
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,260
this is basically someone's nephew hooked up Spotify.

1116
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,180
While daytime DJs play jams,

1117
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,820
surprise performances will kick off

1118
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,300
after the sun goes down for guests at the bell.

1119
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,180
Fans can bring home the same vibes

1120
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,300
to their own summer plans with curated playlists

1121
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,380
from Feed the Beat artists, a Taco Bell program

1122
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,660
that has helped more than 1,600 artists and bands

1123
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,180
discover new fans.

1124
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,820
And ladies and gentlemen, coming back to the stage

1125
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,740
for the fourth time today, Eddie Money.

1126
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,220
Eddie's back.

1127
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,100
Hey, what's up?

1128
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,540
Yeah, they asked me to do it again.

1129
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,700
And I said, so here I am.

1130
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,300
I said, do you got any more Crunchwraps?

1131
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,660
And they laughed and laughed.

1132
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,220
Anyway.

1133
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,620
I've got two tickets to paradise.

1134
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,860
They didn't answer my question,

1135
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,220
but I'm assuming they're out.

1136
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,820
I want to go to this place with a desire

1137
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,300
that I'm not sure I can quantify

1138
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,700
with the sort of linguistic tools

1139
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,420
that we trade in on this show.

1140
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,340
We very rarely get into sort of poetry

1141
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,580
or epic narrative at all.

1142
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,420
And I feel like that's what I would need

1143
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,580
to sort of communicate the desire

1144
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,620
with which I really, really, really, really

1145
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,820
want to go to the bell.

1146
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,220
Yeah.

1147
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,300
If I may, Justin, it seems to me

1148
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,060
to be a bit of a siren song

1149
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,780
drawing you into the cheesy ocean

1150
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,620
to crash upon the nacho rocks.

1151
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,740
Like, you know it will be your undoing.

1152
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,620
Yeah.

1153
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,980
But you're drawn to it.

1154
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,100
Let me remind you, you're going to have to sleep here.

1155
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,060
Yeah.

1156
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,900
That is hard.

1157
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,940
That is hard.

1158
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,020
The other thing that I'm struggling with

1159
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,260
is I've eaten at Taco Bell many times.

1160
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,940
My reaction physically and mentally

1161
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,940
after that is always never again.

1162
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,460
I swear to myself, never again.

1163
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,700
But now I'm sleeping in a place

1164
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,980
where they make it.

1165
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,460
I'm sleeping at the belly of the beast,

1166
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,100
as it were.

1167
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,340
That's hard for me.

1168
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,460
That's tough.

1169
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,340
Can I read a Yahoo?

1170
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:42,580
Yeah.

1171
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,780
Yes, please.

1172
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,020
Yeah, there's a Taco Bell gift shop, by the way,

1173
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,700
where you can buy, it's got,

1174
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,740
I'm looking at right now,

1175
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,460
a Taco Bell is life tie clip,

1176
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,220
which imagines a world

1177
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,300
where you would be someone with a Taco Bell

1178
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,900
is life tie clip,

1179
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,980
but also have any use for a tie

1180
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,660
at any point in your life whatsoever.

1181
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,700
Well, I can think of a couple.

1182
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,380
Okay.

1183
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,660
CEO of Taco Bell.

1184
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,140
Court date.

1185
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,980
Be at bail, bail arrangement.

1186
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,980
Okay, here is a Yahoo.

1187
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,420
Gosh, these are all kind of food related.

1188
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,940
Graham Roebuck also sent this one in.

1189
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,220
It's a hungry app.

1190
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,300
It's from Yahoo Answers user Ernesto,

1191
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,860
who asks,

1192
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,900
which food awakens the beast inside you?

1193
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,700
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,740
Which food awakens the beast inside you?

1195
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,860
Let's get this out of the way.

1196
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,940
I have, and this will just be a blanket

1197
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,620
sort of crude humor joke,

1198
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,780
but I do have irritable bowel syndrome.

1199
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,820
So you can make an argument

1200
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,700
that you're describing most foods.

1201
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,860
More like irritable beast syndrome.

1202
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,820
That makes it cooler for sure, for sure, for sure.

1203
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,260
You've got an irritable beast in your system.

1204
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,340
It feels like it sometimes certainly,

1205
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,420
but let's not go down that route

1206
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,140
because I feel like the Taco Bell one

1207
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,940
used up all of our resources.

1208
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,380
For me, it's kale.

1209
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,580
Okay.

1210
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,100
When I eat kale, I feel like a wild beast.

1211
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,820
That's also true when I eat sticks of cinnamon or rocks.

1212
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,780
Here's a, this is gonna complicate things

1213
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,860
maybe a little bit, but are pills food?

1214
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,260
Do pills count as food?

1215
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,540
Do they unleash the beast?

1216
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,460
In a manner of speaking.

1217
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,580
I see.

1218
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,980
A beast who's not as anxious as a non-beast is.

1219
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,780
Ah, yes.

1220
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,500
Compared to what the non-beast is,

1221
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,060
I am currently and have been for a while now

1222
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,340
beasting the fuck out.

1223
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,020
That is true with Travis, anxiety Travis and sad Travis,

1224
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,660
who is now doing okay, Travis.

1225
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,260
The regular Travis, yeah.

1226
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,860
The fucking beast.

1227
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,500
Oh, a wild man who can focus on homework.

1228
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,540
Yeah, I can get out of bed.

1229
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,500
I'm the beast.

1230
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:05,060
Whoa, I care more about the needs of others.

1231
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,540
I wanna hear more about Travis's pull of homework.

1232
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,140
That's relevant to your day to day.

1233
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,580
Dude, that's all that work is now.

1234
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,020
You know, I work from home.

1235
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,220
It's all homework now.

1236
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,700
Dang, that's great.

1237
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,900
That's so good, dude.

1238
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,020
But what food makes you go wild with power and fury

1239
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,540
and you can be stronger because of the food?

1240
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,100
If I eat the right amount of boneless buffalo wings,

1241
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,820
I feel that way.

1242
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,020
The problem is I don't know what the right amount is

1243
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,620
and it changes every time.

1244
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,260
It's a moving target.

1245
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,500
One too little and I'm still hungry,

1246
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,180
one too many and I instantly feel like death.

1247
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,420
Have you guys tried vegetables?

1248
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:50,920
Yeah.

1249
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,480
Yeah, every show we've ever done for the past few years,

1250
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,360
we request that they put some vegetables backstage

1251
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,760
and then at the end of every show,

1252
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,080
we like to take them and float them on the nearest body of water

1253
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,840
and then shoot a flaming arrow into them

1254
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,200
and watch as they sail off.

1255
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,640
And then we say,

1256
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,760
maybe next show we'll definitely eat these vegetables.

1257
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,640
I mean, if it was a bigger tray, we would have eaten it.

1258
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,560
I mean, I tried one of those orange ones

1259
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
and I didn't care for it one bit.

1260
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,840
Oh, the crunchy boys?

1261
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,680
Yeah, the crunchy orange ones are no good.

1262
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,600
I got sinus surgery last year

1263
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,760
and while I was going home from the hospital,

1264
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,760
they had given me a little drink,

1265
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,600
a little nutritional drink of Boost

1266
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,240
and I drank one of those and I was like,

1267
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,000
I feel incredible.

1268
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,800
But I think it might be because I was still high

1269
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,400
a little bit from the surgery,

1270
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,240
but that Boost made me feel so good.

1271
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,400
So I bought like a 12 pack of Boost

1272
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,520
and it didn't, it wasn't that good.

1273
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,320
You know what I like?

1274
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,080
What I enjoy, which gives me my own Boost TM

1275
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,000
is I enjoy a strawberry and walnut salad.

1276
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,640
It always hits the spot

1277
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,760
and I find it crisp and refreshing and filling

1278
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,040
and gives me the energy I need to get out there.

1279
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,720
You are so not the beast right now.

1280
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,560
This is the not.

1281
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,840
But my beast allows me to finish doing the dishes

1282
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,200
and maybe stretch a little bit.

1283
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,560
You know what, I'll tell you what does me right,

1284
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,880
what makes me feel like I'm getting it done

1285
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,560
and brings out the beast within.

1286
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,000
Sometimes if I have a really healthy cereal in the house,

1287
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,560
I'll pour a really small bowl

1288
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,920
like they do in commercials

1289
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,240
and I'll kind of like put my leg up on a thick,

1290
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,360
sort of prop my leg up on a nearby banister

1291
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,680
like they do in commercials or a big rock

1292
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,760
and just kind of eat it with my puffy vest

1293
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,080
and a self-satisfied look on my face.

1294
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,800
And I really, I like to live in that moment a little bit,

1295
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,960
this world where I'm just having a small bowl of healthy cereal

1296
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
and I'm about to use this energy to hike.

1297
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,280
I mean, a big bowl of Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti

1298
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,360
will get there for me most days.

1299
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,800
Most days, if I have like a big event coming up

1300
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,160
or I'm about to go on book tour

1301
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,080
or I'm about to have like a Comic Con Fred Savage encounter,

1302
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,880
I will just like,

1303
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,600
I have a little can of Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti with me

1304
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,520
and I will just, I'll cram it and be ready for the day.

1305
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,560
I just assume, I assumed that was a given.

1306
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,800
Like I would have said Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti

1307
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,000
if I had known like that wasn't just assumed.

1308
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,520
Like, yeah, yeah.

1309
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,600
Well, yeah, I edited out the part

1310
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,040
where I at the beginning of the question,

1311
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,600
I said, we're all gonna say Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti.

1312
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,240
So let's just pass over that.

1313
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:49,960
Is there, this is slightly changing the question.

1314
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,840
So the inverse.

1315
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Well, there's Mama Freddie's come down spaghetti.

1316
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,240
That's the only thing that can undo the turbo energy

1317
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,360
or else you'll die.

1318
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,960
And then there's Papa Cannoli's turbo ravioli,

1319
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,200
which is basically the same thing.

1320
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,600
This is kind of the inverse,

1321
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,280
but like, do you guys at this point in your lives

1322
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,080
know of food, perhaps specific restaurants

1323
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,600
that you know 100% if you eat at them, you will be sick?

1324
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,400
And not like a, if I overindulge,

1325
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,680
but like 100% if I darken the door there,

1326
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,800
I'm going home sick.

1327
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,320
Do you have places like that?

1328
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,520
Places or meals?

1329
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,200
Fazzolis.

1330
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,120
Fazzolis, yeah, it's not great for you.

1331
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,920
Yes.

1332
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,200
And Long John Silver's.

1333
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,240
If you're gonna go in there, you're gonna leave back.

1334
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,520
I thought you said restaurants.

1335
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,840
That's fair, that's a fair burn.

1336
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,960
On the Long John Silver's brand.

1337
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,640
But that's the thing is, I will say,

1338
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,560
I love quick service food, love it.

1339
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,760
I can't remember the last time.

1340
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,960
No one who loves it calls it that.

1341
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,440
What?

1342
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,480
Fucking nobody.

1343
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,760
That's the ultimate fake test.

1344
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,360
But I can't remember the last time I ate

1345
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,840
a fast food hamburger and walked away like, yes.

1346
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,840
Now I'm ready.

1347
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,160
I really wish I could help make jokes with you guys,

1348
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,080
but all I can do is sit here

1349
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,960
and try and think of other members

1350
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,760
of the canned pasta family.

1351
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,440
The best I've got is Grandma Tanya's power lasagna.

1352
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,720
It's not bad, it's pretty good.

1353
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,440
It's not bad.

1354
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
It's so full of protein,

1355
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,360
but not in the places you would expect this power lasagna.

1356
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,800
So do we leave, for the format of the joke,

1357
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
do we leave turbo, turbo?

1358
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,640
No, this is power lasagna.

1359
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,000
The turbo, this is a different,

1360
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,120
this one's more about gains.

1361
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,440
Oh, I see, okay.

1362
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,960
Turbo lasagna is speed.

1363
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,200
This one's about gains.

1364
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,680
There's probably a smart one.

1365
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,800
Yeah, like maybe like Cousin Joni's meditative rigatoni.

1366
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,040
Yeah, okay.

1367
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,560
That one's about inner peace and mindfulness.

1368
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,920
That one's about focus.

1369
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:12,520
Here's one, Cousin Jim's good sauce.

1370
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,360
Ah, so close.

1371
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,760
Almost nailed it.

1372
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,680
And then for adults who need a little bit of help

1373
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,680
revving their engine,

1374
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,760
we got Papa Pocky's horny gnocchi.

1375
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,640
They're little, and it comes in a discreet can.

1376
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,840
Delivered to your door in a brown paper package.

1377
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,360
It does not say, it says not Papa Pocky's horny gnocchi.

1378
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:50,440
Mr. Jim's nice food.

1379
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,120
It's good, Justin, you're getting us better than that.

1380
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,480
It gets better than the last one.

1381
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,880
You're moving in the right direction.

1382
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,720
Thank you, that's very kind, thank you.

1383
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,920
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week

1384
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,360
on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

1385
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,880
a show that we make just for you.

1386
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1387
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,840
Sorry that things have been a little bit scattershot

1388
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,520
over these past couple weeks and the two weeks to come.

1389
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,000
It's kind of like wild, wild time

1390
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,840
with like the book and book touring,

1391
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,080
Comic-Con and vacation and everything.

1392
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,440
Speaking of which, thanks for hanging in there with us.

1393
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,520
Speaking of which, next episode will almost certainly

1394
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,360
be a live show, we have not talked about this,

1395
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,440
but yeah, there is a, some of the McRoy's

1396
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,160
are going on vacation after the book tour

1397
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,240
and all the touring and stuff, and so I doubt

1398
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,920
that we will have time to record an episode,

1399
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,280
so yeah, I assume next one will be a live show.

1400
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,880
But it'll be a funny one.

1401
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,200
Yeah, you'll like it.

1402
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,520
Or you won't, you know, like it's a free world.

1403
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,320
Yes, so thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1404
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,400
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1405
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,240
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

1406
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,920
which is really good, and thanks to Maximum Fun

1407
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,200
for having us on the network.

1408
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,440
Shit, we have the biggest announcement.

1409
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,560
Oh shit.

1410
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,400
Bean Juice is dead.

1411
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,680
Oh God.

1412
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,800
Okay, yeah, not dead.

1413
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,000
Well, but it's a new-

1414
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,480
Bean Juice, as you know it, is dead.

1415
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,080
We talk, we fucking talked about it.

1416
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,440
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

1417
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,040
We're not spinning it, like a fucking debacle.

1418
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,040
It is a new era and a fresh face

1419
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,280
that all our loyal bean heads are gonna go wild for,

1420
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,440
and it's a benefit for their lifestyle,

1421
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,200
and it's gonna be more relatable to them

1422
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,720
and their friends and their families.

1423
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,440
It is not, we did not take a bath on this.

1424
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,120
We are making so much money that we wanna cash in, okay?

1425
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,280
Start over, start over, start over.

1426
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,880
Have we got an offer for you?

1427
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,480
You're gonna be so excited about it.

1428
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,880
Finally, a mug that keeps up with it.

1429
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,880
Listen, you loved Bean Juice,

1430
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,800
but you couldn't take Bean Juice on the go

1431
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,000
because that Bean Juice mug

1432
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,320
just wouldn't keep up with your lifestyle.

1433
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,280
But now, with Bean Juice 2.0,

1434
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,480
the new, latest, and greatest version of Bean Juice,

1435
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,640
you could take Bean Juice with you wherever you go.

1436
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,920
This is a portable mug, not like our first mug,

1437
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,400
which you felt weird taking with you on the go.

1438
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,280
This one, you're like, what if I did this?

1439
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,200
It's just functionally, it's the same mug.

1440
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,800
Can I take a swing, let me take a swing at it.

1441
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

1442
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,800
You're still drinking a Bean Juice 1.0 mug?

1443
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,720
Okay, grandpa or grandma.

1444
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,880
Don't think so.

1445
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,320
This one, this is you.

1446
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,360
Ah, time to sit down with my Bean Juice mug

1447
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
and pour some of the brown stuff in it.

1448
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,280
And you lift it up with your old arm.

1449
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,280
Gonna put it to my mouth.

1450
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,200
Hey, what's this cup say?

1451
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,440
Bee-een Juice?

1452
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,360
And while you've read that, while it takes you

1453
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,400
the time to read that, I did a stunt over a vape shop

1454
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,320
and got one already.

1455
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,960
And when I landed, I was holding the 2.0 mug,

1456
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,720
which you can read much faster.

1457
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,640
And the 2.0 company, it's a rebirth for Bean Juice.

1458
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,560
It's still pronounced the same way,

1459
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,840
but the company is now spelled B-N-J-C.

1460
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,680
It's so fresh now.

1461
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,880
I know you were saying that our stock ticker symbol

1462
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,160
is B-E-A-N, and so that's gonna be very confusing

1463
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,880
for the investors, but they don't know that vowels ain't it.

1464
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,680
No.

1465
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,600
We don't care about the investors.

1466
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,120
It's never been about the money.

1467
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,120
It's about profits.

1468
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,520
Yes.

1469
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,240
That's the only thing that is different from what they

1470
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,680
don't seem to understand on Wall Street when they're like,

1471
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,160
we're foreclosing, et cetera, et cetera.

1472
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,360
Unpaid bills, blah, blah, blah.

1473
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,080
If we don't traffic in money, we traffic in lifestyle.

1474
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,800
And profits.

1475
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,520
Profits.

1476
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,760
And profits that were supposed to be,

1477
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,760
according to DFTBA, fucking bulletproof, my man, on mugs.

1478
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,320
The margins on these things were supposed to be outrageous.

1479
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,080
People use mugs, they said.

1480
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,320
That's why Hank and John blowed a bunch of smoke in our face

1481
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,520
at the same time and said,

1482
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
these mugs are gonna make you guys fucking rich.

1483
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,640
And when they blew the smoke, it formed the word mugs,

1484
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,520
and then they turned the S into a dollar sign

1485
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,840
by like, it was so cool.

1486
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,560
It was cool.

1487
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,000
It was so cool.

1488
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,160
And we gave them our life savings to make those mugs,

1489
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,920
and now they're in Tahiti, and we're left with the, no.

1490
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,920
Bean juice 2.0.

1491
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,640
It's the new cool for the cool kids.

1492
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,280
Wait till you see this new design.

1493
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,960
You're gonna shit.

1494
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,200
Anything else?

1495
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,160
Can we wrap it on up?

1496
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,400
There's a whole bunch of new stuff coming to the merch store, too.

1497
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,000
You can go to mackerelmerch.com.

1498
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,800
None of it matters.

1499
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,320
I'm going to be at Gen Con.

1500
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,680
You can check out my Twitter.

1501
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,760
The banner at the top of my Twitter has all the dates.

1502
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,560
Dad's gonna be there soon.

1503
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,360
We're ruined!

1504
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,200
You can go to TravisMackerelRite.com,

1505
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,480
and it's gonna be there as well.

1506
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,480
And I will see you at Gen Con.

1507
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by,

1508
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,480
oh geez, the hat trick.

1509
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,680
Graham Roebuck, well done.

1510
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,680
Thank you, Graham.

1511
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,480
It's anonymous.

1512
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,640
No, it's Yahoo Answers user, BearThePolarBear, who asks,

1513
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,200
why is Peter Gabriel's voice nice?

1514
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,720
My name is Justin Mackerel.

1515
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,120
Travis Mackerel, you caught me drinking on that one.

1516
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,720
I was taking a sip on that one.

1517
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,680
Coach Billy's football fusilli.

1518
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,640
Is that anything?

1519
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,080
It's close.

1520
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,280
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1521
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:34,840
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1522
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,960
Maximumfun.org.

1523
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,000
Comedy and culture.

1524
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,120
Artist owned.

1525
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,160
Listener supported.

1526
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:43,960
Hey, James.

1527
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,760
Hey, Nneke.

1528
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,640
What we doing, girl?

1529
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,800
We are inviting the awesome listeners of Maximum Fun

1530
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,320
to join us at Minority Corner.

1531
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,440
Ooh, fun.

1532
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,000
But you know how we go on Tangent City.

1533
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,120
We're the joint mayors.

1534
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,320
We're not gonna do that, okay?

1535
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,280
Soup's focused.

1536
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,840
Okay, so Minority Corner is where you can all come

1537
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,360
and get your pop culture takes.

1538
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,400
Plus social commentary, news, and TV movie reactions

1539
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,680
like Avengers Endgame.

1540
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,800
No spoilers here.

1541
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,680
Ooh, snap.

1542
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,120
Sometimes we dig into the vaults

1543
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,520
and we review and recap those movies you missed.

1544
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,120
Good at you, Halle Berry's Kidnapped.

1545
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,200
I love how she always gives 1000%.

1546
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,000
Like Beyonce.

1547
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,520
Did you see Homecoming on Netflix?

1548
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,440
She was burning it down like the Mother of Dragons.

1549
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,880
Have you seen the latest Game of Thrones?

1550
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,440
So good.

1551
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,560
Only thing missing?

1552
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,080
More black people.

1553
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,280
What you think about Mayor Pete?

1554
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,240
Wait a minute, James.

1555
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,200
We went on a tangent?

1556
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:26,760
Yes.

1557
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,400
Ah well.

1558
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,720
Join us every Friday for more tangents.

1559
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:45,480
On Maximum Fun.
